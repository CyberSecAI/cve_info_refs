User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.101 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
The .JNLP (Java web start app) should be treated as executable.
Visit: <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/webstart/deploying.html>
Press 'Launch'
Actual results:
The downloaded file is not treated as executable.
Expected results:
Given that the result of this file is that Java is executed then this should be the same as .jar files. Granted, initially these files are always opened with restricted mode, but apparently they can be signed to bypass this. I don't think it's far fetched to imagine someone malicious is capable of signing these with rogue certs.
Also, (hate to do this) but Google Chrome treats it as dangerous.

Yes, we really should.
The one in ApplicationReputation.cpp comes from [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/browser/resources/safe\_browsing/download\_file\_types.asciipb](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/master/chrome/browser/resources/safe_browsing/download_file_types.asciipb), which I monitor.

There's ".pdf" in there though, that I'm pretty sure we don't want to warn about being executable, although apparently we may still want to scan for malware. I know some document types may contain dangerous macros when used with certain viewers, or they can be used to trigger security bugs, but this is true of any downloaded document type regardless of type. To be useful, the list would have to be curated based on real-world usage.

Ok, so maybe we do need two lists:
1. list of executables (in nsLocalFile\*)
2. list of files to scan (in ApplicationReputation)
but the second would make use of the first and not include any entries that we already consider executable.
Then whenever Chrome adds new executables to their list, we can decide which of these lists it should be added to.
Also, we should never remove anything from the first list without adding it to the second.

I filed [bug 1472631](/show_bug.cgi?id=1472631 "NEW - Investigate serving the list of executable files remotely or in a hotfixable way") to investigate serving the list of extensions in nsLocalFile in a hotfixable way. I don't know if a similar bug exists or is needed for the list in ApplicationReputation.
In the meantime, apart from ".jnlp", are there other file extensions from the list used by Chrome that we should add to the nsLocalFile list?Flags: needinfo?(francois)

So far, the updates have not been frequent enough to justify investing a lot of time in making this list more dynamic.Flags: needinfo?(francois)

Hi, This issue seems to be Fixed on windows 10 in the latest Firefox Beta - 67.0b3, I will mark this issue accordingly. Please note that I don't have access to all available extensions mentioned in [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1392955#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - JNLP should be treated as executable") and I confirmed this bug based on the file from its Description.

If anybody else has any links that might redirect me to those other extension files, I'll be happy to check those as well.

I believe this bug is an error or oversight. FWIW, I run Java SE Product management at Oracle, and we've had a good relationship with the Firefox team dating back to 2013 or so. Unfortunately it would seem a lot of the people we used to work with are gone (Coates, Smedberg come to mind), or perhaps someone would have thought to reach out to myself or someone from Oracle to help work through this.

This change has caused harm and is causing your users to switch back to Chrome, Safari and Edge for their WebStart needs. Ironically these are the users that had switched to you years ago because you were offering the best and safest experience.

JNLP is not an executable. JNLP should be treated the same as any Word Document. A JNLP file will not cause execution on a system unless it has a valid signature, and the user explicitly authorizes the launching based on information provided by the signature. Moreover, we even check if the Java runtime (if there is one) is current, and prompt the user to update if required, something you wouldn't experience with a docx file, for example. We're happy to discuss with anyone at Mozilla, I would reach out but as I already noted, apparently our contacts are all long gone.

For enterprise applications it would be helpful to define trusted domains or at least remove the jnlp from this list to avoid the message confusing users. Or at least to have a remember this page as secure.

Any chance to implement this?

I second Donald Smith on this, a JNLP is NOT an executable. Java is launched, but before the downloaded jars are run, the user has to confirm if he really wants to execute the application.

It impacts the usability of our enterprise application, because now every time a user want to run our app, a new file is downloaded in his download folder, and he has to make sure to then click on the latest version of this file, otherwise it won't work (each run gives a different JNLP file because of credentials).

And now instead of these jnlp files being hidden in a temp folder (which can be automatically cleaned), they accumulate in his download folder, where they have absolutely no value.

Please reconsider, or at least implement what Johannes Michler has suggested.

To stop the immediate pain for organizations that use Java Web Start we are backing out the fix for this bug from ESR-68 in [bug 1576616](/show_bug.cgi?id=1576616 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should not treat JNLP files as Executables (revert bug 1392955) on ESR-68").

> I second Donald Smith on this, a JNLP is NOT an executable. Java is launched, but before the downloaded jars are run, the user has to confirm if he really wants to execute the application.

You just described an executable. You can argue that a prompt from Java is good enough that Firefox doesn't also need to prompt, but you can't say it's not an executable. In any case there are obvious problems with the user interactions here that we should address. In particular it shouldn't behave *worse* than downloading an actual .exe. There are also platform disparities we need to address. This fixed bug is not the place to address those issues so I'm filing a new bug for that. I suppose [bug 1576616](/show_bug.cgi?id=1576616 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should not treat JNLP files as Executables (revert bug 1392955) on ESR-68") could have been that, but 1) we took that over to land a fix on ESR, and 2) the usability issues are bigger than just JNLP.

Thanks Daniel!

It feels like we're using different meanings for "executable". jnlp is just like a docx file -- it isn't executable itself, but does trigger a separately installed application (Microsoft Word) to execute with it. If a user doesn't have Word installed, the OS would ask what to do with it, ditto for Java and JNLP. It feels from our perspective they (.jnlp and .docx) should be treated similarly.

Happy to discuss or elaborate, and glad to hear the immediate pain point can be managed.

This is a disagreement we're unlikely to resolve. To us a word file is fundamentally a "document" like HTML while Java is a programming language.

By that reasoning a word file should also be considered an executable, considering word documents can contain macros and scripting in VBA, a programming language. The same kind of safeguards apply to that as to JNLP (user is explicitly prompted before execution). Same for excel, and any other document that has extended scripting capabilities.

I have to agree with Donald here that you shouldn't treat this any differently.

Facing the same problem I found one workaround. Add following example content to the `"mimeTypes"` collection in handlers.json located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default. Afterwards you will be able to assign any program you like to open jnlp with in Firefox settings.

`"application/x-java-jnlp-file":{"action":2,"handlers":[{"name":"start-jre.bat","path":"C:\\JRE\\start-jre.bat"}],"extensions":["jnlp"]}`

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Steps to reproduce:
Install attached PoC extension and follow instructions.
Actual results:
I am mainly using the behavior where if a XPI file is visited then Firefox will automatically attempt to install and prompt user for confirmation.
I noticed that you press ALT+A you can agree to installing the webextension. And so I ask a user to hold down ALT+A and I then attempt to install addon only to trick user into agreeing to install.
Expected results:
Block from ALT+A being activated as soon as the install prompt appears.
A version of this can be done from normal web. See [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey") and [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey")

This one is different in that all I do is open a popup to an XPI with noopener tag, this way we initiate install prompt automatically. Bypassing the usual "We prevented this site from installing..." initial prompt as it appears in the PoC for [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey").
I also redirect original page to a legitimate extension that is more popular.

We used to have a mitigation for this in the old XPInstall dialog. It disabled the install button until a timeout had elapsed without any input or the dialog losing focus. I'm not sure why that was removed in the new flow.

As far as I can tell, this protection disappeared with some install flow changes that Mossop implemented years ago. The revision history is pretty messy, though, so it's hard to track down the exact bug.
But the last time we significantly refactored the install flow was in [bug 1308295](/show_bug.cgi?id=1308295 "VERIFIED FIXED - Prompt users with permissions for third-party webextensions installs"), by aswan.Flags: needinfo?(amckay) → needinfo?(aswan)

My understanding was that the delay is supposed to be handled inside PopupNotifications.jsm
eg:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/33cc9e0331da8d9ff3750f1e68d72d61201176cb/toolkit/modules/PopupNotifications.jsm#1496-1501>
where buttonDelay comes from:

I did a little more archaeology, the old install dialog is actually still in the tree at toolkit/mozapps/extensions/content/xpinstallConfirm.{xul,js} There are some differences:
PopupNotifications:
- Use the preference security.notification\_enable\_delay which defaults to 500ms
- just ignores clicks before the delay has elapsed
xpInstallConfirm:
- Uses the preference security.dialog\_enable\_delay which defaults to 1 second
- Disables the button and displays a counter that counts down during the delay, enabling the button after the delay is over
The real functional difference is 1 second vs 500ms, the rest appears to be cosmetic (but probably more useful to avoid confusing/frustrating users the longer the lockout lasts)
I didn't actually verify that the PopupNotifications delays are working, but they appear to be covered by a test:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/33cc9e0331da8d9ff3750f1e68d72d61201176cb/browser/base/content/test/popupNotifications/browser_popupNotification_3.js#128-151>Flags: needinfo?(aswan)

Even if the old fix is implemented (timing out confirm button for X number of seconds) can be bypassed by loading a window in the background of the main window and then focusing on it after >X number of seconds.
That can only be done using WebExtensions (a version can be done using normal web but requires much higher user interaction).
I think it's worth thinking about dealing with the prompt onblur. Either reset the timer onfocus or send a cancel event onblur (so if the user blurs a tab/window with a XPinstall is the same as if he pressed "cancel")

No it can't. The delay in the old xpinstall dialog requires that the dialog be focused for the entire length of the delay. The counter resets whenever the dialog blurs.

Finally getting back to this, I'd like to get a second opinion on what we should do here.
I think the main functional difference we need is the blur/focus handling that xpinstallConfirm had (to be explicit, that is the notification must be focused for the entire delay, if it loses focus we start the delay timer over again).
There's also the difference in the timing of the delay (500 vs 1000 milliseconds, see [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey")).
Finally, disabling the primary button is cosmetic but as we expand the number of situations where the button doesn't work, it gets more and more important).
This will go into PopupNotifications, I'm not sure how much of it to make default and how much to make opt-in for users of PopupNotifications. Johann, any thoughts?Flags: needinfo?(jhofmann)

And upon reading more carefully, PopupNotifications does handle the case where a different top level window is focused:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/795575287259a370d00518098472eaa5b362bfa7/toolkit/modules/PopupNotifications.jsm#622-627>
There are still a few different "attacks" described in this bug:
Neither of the attacks from the new2.html or new3.html attachments appear to work on a recent Nightly
The attack in new4.html takes advantage of [bug 1294413](/show_bug.cgi?id=1294413 "NEW - Potential address bar spoof using @title (or spoofing a \"browser\" message) for form validation popup"). I think the last one should be handled separately, but [bug 1294413](/show_bug.cgi?id=1294413 "NEW - Potential address bar spoof using @title (or spoofing a \"browser\" message) for form validation popup") is public. It looks like :jkt started working on it a while back. Jonathan, do you think you can pick that one back up?
Finally, the attack in new.html entails requires tricking the user into holding down the access key that accepts the permission prompt, that works due to standard keyboard repeat behavior where holding down a key (or combination of keys) generates a series of keypress events. I think it would make sense for doorhangers to ignore key events for repeated keypresses, but fixing that is going to entail messing with a pile of XBL bindings :( I'll see if I can come up with something though.Flags: needinfo?(jhofmann) → needinfo?(jkt)

And follow-up to the last part of the previous comment, accessKey handling doesn't happen from an XBL binding, its at a much lower level, so I'm not sure how practical its going to be to ignore events that come from keyboard repeat...

Hm I have to say that the "holding down alt or ctrl + a" exploit worries me. It effectively renders the 500ms delay completely useless. This affects all PopupNotifications (also permission prompts) and we should probably investigate fixing it despite the parts about that being pretty hard :)Component: Add-ons Manager → Notifications and AlertsSummary: Tricking user into installing webextension through user interaction → Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey

Hrmm. For some reason on a recent Nightly build holding down ALT+A doesn't trigger the event listener (for the PoC in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey")). I re-tested on an older build and it still works there. Odd.
If you are having trouble reproducing the bug described in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey") just replace 'onkeypress' with 'onkeydown' in the original PoC attached.

I chatted with Johann a bit and we're both unsure about the implementation here.
A few questions -- :smaug, if you're not the right person to answer these can you redirect?
The quick background is that the attack we want to fix here involves tricking a user into holding down the key combination that corresponds to the access key for the accept button on a permission dialog, which causes one of the later repeated keypress events to accept the permission before the user gets a chance to see it.
So I think the desired behavior is these notifications ignore keypress events if the "repeat" property is true. These notifications are a pile of xul and xbl but underneath it all is a xul button with an accesskey attribute.
So first question: can we make this change from javascript or are events that match an accesskey handled at some lower layer and not observable from javascript? If its the latter, how feasible is this to address? Would something like adding an attribute to xul elements that would cause repeated keypress events to be ignored be reasonable? Regardless, pointers to the existing code that handles accesskeys would be helpful...Flags: needinfo?(bugs)

Did you try a capturing addEventListener on the button with preventDefault or stopImmediatePropagation if .repeat is true?

I'm doubtful that involving the repeat var would suffice in preventing a similar attack. Hypothetically if repeat was checked, wouldn't we just be able to show the notification as soon as 'alt' was pressed once (and 'a' pressed very shortly after)? Or would the 500ms be enough for the user to notice something happening visually and release the keys?
Attached is a PoC without using repeat. Worth testing it when fix is applied.

Yes, that's what this delay assumes. The idea for a fix is to always reset the counter when a repeat key event is registered, so the only exploit left would have to time this so that the user presses "a" over 500ms after the dialog was spawned. And even then they would only have managed to skip the first doorhanger, whereas add-on installs have several levels of confirmation (unlike permission requests, but I think that's an okay trade-off).

I was planning to look into that soon, but so far we just talked about it. My suspicion is that EventStateManager handles the shortcut before we get a chance to, but I might be wrong.

We already have a capturing listener:

That listener doesn't currently try to handle the accessKey but empricially, it is not invoked when the accessKey is pressed)

The component is a dumping ground for like 4-5 different "notification" things so it doesn't really map to resourcing. I would say doorhanger stuff should fall under the Privacy team since they did a lot of work on it in the last few years.

So, this is a pretty simple first patch that considers a magic accesskey-prevent-repeat attribute on elements to avoid performing the accesskey in that case.
Smaug, do you think that's the right approach?

Add a way to prevent accepting repeat key events for accesskeys
Do we ever need to handle access keys for repeated keys?
a11y folks may have an opinion here, but I hope not.
Ask surkov?
accesskey-prevent-repeat shouldn't of course be supported on HTML elements.

Hm, yeah. I agree that repeat key events for access keys doesn't sound useful. OTOH when testing this for HTML elements, Chrome and Safari have the same behavior (allowing repeated access keys). I'm not sure we should start breaking compatibility in content land here, since this attack pretty specifically targets browser chrome.
So, we could either globally disallow repeat for XUL elements or in chrome windows (with the expectation that our chrome windows will contain HTML at some point).

I'm not aware of a reason why we would have to handle access keys for repeated keys, but agreed it better stay compatible with other browsers. Curious, whether this should be addressed by HTML standard to bring everyone on the same page?

Verifying this issue on latest Beta 67.0b3 on Windows 10 x64:

* installed the temporary PoC attached (replaced with keydown) and the prevent notification is not bypassed
* the xpi.html file provided in [Comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey") no longer bypasses the prevent notification
* new2.html file is also prevented from installing
* new3.html is prevented from installing
* new4.html which should cover the web extension install prompt may also be fixed as it no longer displays the message as in the attached screenshot. Now it will look like this <https://imgur.com/a/bIetYDK>, is this the intended fix?

Hopefully, I covered all the testcases that were provided by the reporter. Abdulrahman, could you please take a look again? Just to be sure... Will verify the rest of the OS afterward.

It does appear that all original PoC's are fixed on Beta 67.0b3, tested on windows 10 x64.

A few notes:

* 'new3.html' PoC, although the trick doesn't work anymore I did notice that the popup can still block the 'You are now in fullscreen' text. This could be another bug worth a seperate file.
* PoC in [Comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - Tricking user into accepting PopupNotification prompts through holding down accessKey"), 'xpi.html' - Although the original bug is fixed, there is still some way to trick a user into installing by having the user instead of holding down 'ALT+A' they would hold down 'ALT' and at the same time repeatedly press 'A', granted this is much more user interaction but worth noting I think.

I will do more testing and see if all is well and will make a new comment only if I find something.
