## Summary

A recently discovered security vulnerability affects the Bosch Video Recording Manager (VRM) software. The VRM software is commonly installed as a component in Bosch Video Management Systems (BVMS) and included in DIVAR IP 5000 devices. The vulnerability potentially allows unauthenticated access to a limited subset of certificates. The affected certificates are stored in the operating systems certificate store. The vulnerability is exploitable via the network interface. Bosch rates this vulnerability at 9.9 (Critical) and recommends customers to update vulnerable components with fixed software versions.

As of 2019 May 9th, updated firmware files are published on the Bosch Download Store
[[2]](/security-advisories/bosch-sa-804652.html#ref2)
.
As of 2019 May 9th, there is currently no indication that the vulnerability is either publicly known or utilized.

If a software update is not possible in a timely manner, a reduction in the systems network exposure is advised. Internet-accessible systems should be firewalled. Additional protective steps like network isolation by VLAN, IP filtering features of the devices and other technologies can be used to further decrease the exposure of vulnerable devices.

The vulnerability was discovered during internal product tests.

## Solution

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the software of affected Bosch products to a fixed version. If an update is not
possible in a timely manner, the mitigation approaches Firewalling and IP Filtering can be utilized. A list of affected and
fixed software versions is available in the
[âAffected Hardwareâ](/security-advisories/bosch-sa-804652.html#affected-hardware)
and
[âAffected Softwareâ](/security-advisories/bosch-sa-804652.html#affected-software)
chapter of this document.

### Mitigations and Workarounds

In case the referenced software patches cannot be applied, e.g. for BVMS versions 7.0 and earlier, before updating to the latest version, the following measures could mitigate the associated risk.

**Firewalling (network)**

It is advised that the devices should not be exposed directly to the internet or other insecure networks. This includes portforwarding,
which would not protect devices adequately. Firewalling a device significantly reduces its attack surface.

**IP Filtering (Device)**

As an additional supporting measure in shared environments, internal IP filters of BVMS Systems can be activated. This
allows the device to whitelist IPs and IP-ranges. IPs not included in these ranges cannot connect, and therefore not exploit
this vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

This vulnerability is classified as âCWE-284: Improper Access Control.â The affected RCP+ server of the VRM component allows arbitrary and unauthenticated access to a limited subset of certificates, stored in the underlying Microsoft Windows operating system. The fixed versions implement modified authentication checks. The vulnerability resides in the software from VRM version 3.70. Prior releases of VRM software are considered unaffected.
