Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003021:

**CVE-2019-1003021**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin stored the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration. While the secret was encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text within the configuration form.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the exposure of the client secret during the transmission and display of the global security configuration form. This is due to a lack of masking or encryption of the secret when displayed in the UI, even though it's encrypted at rest.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins configuration form could potentially view the client secret. This could allow them to impersonate the Jenkins instance or perform other malicious actions on the OpenID Connect provider (depending on what the client secret grants access to), though this is not explicitly stated. The risk also includes potential compromise via browser extensions or XSS attacks, though this is not related directly to this CVE
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves accessing the Jenkins global configuration form, typically by a user with administrative privileges.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have access to the Jenkins global configuration page. This usually requires administrator or similar privileges on Jenkins, or be in a position to intercept network traffic (although not specified in this particular CVE description).

**Additional Notes:**
* The content provides more details than the basic CVE description (which only mentions "plain text secret").
* The advisory specifically mentions that the client secret was "transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking", clarifying the issue.
* The resolution is to encrypt the client secret while transmitting it in the configuration form.
* The advisory assigns this vulnerability a low severity (CVSS score available).
* The advisory confirms the affected version as up to and including version 1.4, and indicates the fix is in 1.5
