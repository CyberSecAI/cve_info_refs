## Descriptions

### Sandbox Bypass in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1292
/
CVE-2019-1003005**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

This affected an HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script that was not covered in the [2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266](../2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266) and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration prohibiting unsafe AST transforming annotations.

### Sandbox Bypass in Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-1293
/
CVE-2019-1003006**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`groovy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/groovy)**

**Description:**

Groovy Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.

### Sandbox Bypass via CSRF in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1295 (1)
/
CVE-2019-1003007**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
The endpoint checked for the Overall/RunScripts permission, but did not require POST requests, so it was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
This allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.
Additionally, the form validation HTTP endpoint now requires that requests be sent via POST to prevent CSRF.

### Sandbox Bypass via CSRF in Warnings Next Generation Plugin

**SECURITY-1295 (2)
/
CVE-2019-1003008**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Next Generation Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
The endpoint checked for the Overall/RunScripts permission, but did not require POST requests, so it was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
This allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.
Additionally, the form validation HTTP endpoint now requires that requests be sent via POST to prevent CSRF.

### Improper certificate validation with StartTLS in Active Directory Plugin

**SECURITY-859
/
CVE-2019-1003009**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin performs TLS upgrade (StartTLS) after connecting to domain controllers through insecure LDAP.
In this mode, certificates were not properly validated, effectively trusting all certificates, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.

This only affected TLS upgrades.
The LDAPS mode, available by setting the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` to `true`, was unaffected.

The plugin now properly validates certificates according to the TLS trust configuration when performing a TLS upgrade.

### CSRF vulnerability in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-1095
/
CVE-2019-1003010**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

Git Plugin allows the creation of a tag in a job workspace’s Git repository with accompanying metadata attached to a build record.

The HTTP endpoint to create the tag did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The HTTP endpoint to create the tag now requires that requests are sent via POST.

### Recursive token expansion results in information disclosure and DoS in Token Macro Plugin

**SECURITY-1102
/
CVE-2019-1003011**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`token-macro`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/token-macro)**

**Description:**

Token Macro Plugin recursively applied token expansion.

This could be used by users able to affect input to token expansion (such as change log messages), to inject additional tokens into the input, which would then be expanded, resulting in information disclosure (for example values of environment variables), or denial of service.

Most tokens have been changed to no longer recursively apply token expansion.

### Blue Ocean did not require CSRF tokens

**SECURITY-1201
/
CVE-2019-1003012**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

Blue Ocean did not require CSRF tokens ("crumbs") for POST requests with the `Content-Type: application/json`.

Blue Ocean now requires that valid CSRF tokens are present in POST requests.

### XSS vulnerability via user description in Blue Ocean

**SECURITY-1204
/
CVE-2019-1003013**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

Blue Ocean did not properly escape HTML/JavaScript content set on the current user’s description field, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by administrators and other people accessing Jenkins with the same user account.

Blue Ocean now properly escapes HTML/JavaScript content set on the current user’s description field.

### XSS vulnerability in Config File Provider Plugin

**SECURITY-1253
/
CVE-2019-1003014**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`config-file-provider`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)**

**Description:**

Config File Provider Plugin improperly handled script names in its JavaScript-based UI, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Config File Provider Plugin now properly handles script names.

### XXE vulnerability in Job Import Plugin

**SECURITY-905 (1)
/
CVE-2019-1003015**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin allows to import jobs from other Jenkins instances.
As a first step in this process, Job Import Plugin sends a request to another Jenkins instance, parsing XML REST API output to obtain a list of jobs that could be imported.

Job Import Plugin did not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
This allowed attackers able to control either the server Jenkins will query, or the URL Jenkins queries, to have it parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

External entity resolution has been disabled for the XML parser used in Job Import Plugin 3.0.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Job Import Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-905 (2)
/
CVE-2019-1003016**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin did not check user permissions on its API endpoint used to access remote Jenkins instances.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Job Import Plugin 3.0 will only access Jenkins instances using credentials defined in the global configuration.

### CSRF vulnerability in Job Import Plugin allowed creating and overwriting jobs, installing some plugins

**SECURITY-1302
/
CVE-2019-1003017**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin did not require that POST requests are sent to its `/import` URL, which processes requests to import jobs.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that could be exploited to create or replace jobs on the local instance if the remote Jenkins instance has different ones with the same name, or to install additional plugins, if jobs on the remote Jenkins instance reference them in their configuration.

Job Import Plugin 3.0 restricted which remote Jenkins instances jobs can be imported from, limiting how this can be exploited.
From Job Import Plugin 3.1, the `/import` URL requires that requests are sent via POST.

### GitHub Authentication Plugin showed plain text client secret in configuration form

**SECURITY-602
/
CVE-2019-1003018**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin stores the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the client secret is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking.
This could result in exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

GitHub Authentication Plugin now encrypts the client secret transmitted to administrators viewing the global security configuration form.

### Session fixation vulnerability in GitHub Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-797
/
CVE-2019-1003019**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin did not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login, allowing attackers able to control or obtain another user’s pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

GitHub Authentication Plugin now invalidates the previous session during login and creates a new one.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Kanboard Plugin allowed server-side request forgery

**SECURITY-818
/
CVE-2019-1003020**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`kanboard`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kanboard)**

**Description:**

Kanboard Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to submit a GET request to an attacker-specified URL.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin showed plain text client secret in configuration form

**SECURITY-886
/
CVE-2019-1003021**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`oic-auth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/oic-auth)**

**Description:**

OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin stores the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the client secret is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking.
This could result in exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

The OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin now encrypts the client secret transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.

### Monitoring Plugin did not apply CSRF protection even if enabled in Jenkins

**SECURITY-1153
/
CVE-2019-1003022**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

Monitoring Plugin provides a standalone JavaMelody servlet with an independent CSRF protection configuration.
Even if Jenkins had CSRF protection enabled, Monitoring Plugin may not have it enabled.

Monitoring Plugin now checks on startup whether Jenkins has CSRF protection enabled and enables its own CSRF protection accordingly.

|  | Monitoring Plugin does not take into account configuration changes applied after Jenkins startup or after Monitoring Plugin finishes loading. Administrators need to restart Jenkins when enabling or disabling the CSRF protection configuration to apply the change to Monitoring Plugin. |
| --- | --- |

### Clickjacking vulnerability in Monitoring Plugin

**SECURITY-1154**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

Monitoring Plugin did not set the `X-Frame-Options` header, allowing its pages to be embedded.
This could result in clickjacking attacks.

Monitoring Plugin now sets the `X-Frame-Options` header to `sameorigin`, preventing embedding.

### XSS vulnerability in Warnings Next Generation Plugin

**SECURITY-1271
/
CVE-2019-1003023**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not properly escape HTML content in warnings displayed on the Jenkins UI, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to control warnings parser input.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now removes unsafe HTML content from warnings.

## User guide

[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) is an authentication and authorization protocol that allow users to use single sign-on (SSO) to access an application (Jenkins in this case) using Identity Providers. In practice, with this plugin, Jenkins administrators can configure a provider which will authenticate users, provide basic information (email, username, groups) and let Jenkins grant rights accordingly.

After installing the plugin, the Jenkins administrator can choose "OpenID Connect" as [Security Realm](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/managing-security/#access-control). The configuration involves the configuration of the provider and the related authorisation strategy.

Configurations for specific providers are documented:

* [Google Provider](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin/blob/master/docs/configuration/GOOGLE.md)
* [Gitlab Provider](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin/blob/master/docs/configuration/GITLAB.md)
* [Azure AD (blog post)](http://www.epiclabs.io/configure-jenkins-use-azure-ad-authentication-openid-connect/)

### Installation

OpenID Connect Authentication plugin is installed as other plugins:

* either using [Jenkins plugin management](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) from the web UI or the command line
* or using [Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/casc/#configuration-as-code)

In either case, choosing the plugin as Security Realm means that other authentication methods (Jenkins Database, LDAP, ...) will no longer be available and any misconfiguration or service availability issue will lock out the users. An *escape hatch* can be activated at configuration time to define a admin credential which can be used to recover access to Jenkins.

### Configuration quickstart

Configuration of this plugin takes a bit of effort as it requires some knowledge of the openid connect standard as well as the non-standard configuration of the various identity providers out there. Should you configure this plugin against a identity provider then please share your experiences and found caveats through a blog post or by adding it to the documentation.

In a nutshell, the configuration is done in three steps:

1. **Register Jenkins** as an OIDC client in your provide. You will need these details:
   * Login Redirect URI: `${JENKINS_ROOT_URL}/securityRealm/finishLogin`
   * Logout Redirect URI: `${JENKINS_ROOT_URL}/OicLogout`
   * scope: openid profile email
   * Grant Type: `authorization_code`
   * Response Types: `code, token, id_token`
2. **Generate Client ID** and secret which are needed in plugin configuration
3. **Configure plugin** with providers endpoints, security features and specific configuration.
    Normally, providers expose .well-known/openid-configuration which has all the details client need to know.

Detailed instructions for [Generic OpenID Connect](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin/blob/master/docs/configuration/README.md) configuration are provided in the documentation. Some [HOWTO](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin/blob/master/docs/howto/README.md) are provided for the various aspects of the configuration.

See the following screenshot utilizing the google well known endpoint for a minimal configuration example:

[![global-config](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin@master/docs/images/global-config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/global-config.png)

All of the fields can be configured as a [JMES Path](https://jmespath.org/) specification. Most of the time, the name of the field in the idtoken or userinfo is enough.

### Interacting with Jenkins as a non front-end user

TLDR: use an API token instead as described here:  [Authenticating scripted clients](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/authenticating-scripted-clients/)

Using basic auth for authentication won't work. This is because jenkins has no knowledge of the password due to the way openid connect works: Identifying a user is a three way interaction between the user, Jenkins and the openid provider.

The plugin asks the configured openid provider to confirm the identity of the user is and does this in a way that both Jenkins and the provider are 'talking' about the same user. The openid connect provider will likely challenge the user to prove it's identity and might do this by requesting a username and password but this is entirely up to the provider. This part is between the user and the openid connect provider, Jenkins (using this plugin) delegates proving ones identity to the provider and will go with whatever conclusion the provider draws. This has the benefit that with openid connect the service your trying to access (in our case Jenkins) never sees a user password, so even if Jenkins is compromised an attacker can't intercept passwords or other secrets. Using basic auth would require one to send their password to Jenkins which would defeat this.

Scripted clients can still interact with Jenkins even when the openid connect plugin is active: they will have to use an API token.  [Authenticating scripted clients](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Authenticating%2Bscripted%2Bclients) describes how to obtain one.

## OpenID Connect Authentication plugin

This plugin relies on the users and people of goodwill to improve and make the plugin evolve in the most useful way. All feedbacks and help are welcome. We can provide help and support but it is limited to the fair use of volunteers' free time.

### Open Tickets (bugs and feature requests)

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) is our main communication channel for issues and feature request. We will look at issues entered through [Jenkins Jira](https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=project+%3D+JENKINS+AND+component+%3D+oic-auth-plugin) but the response time may currently be spotty at best.

Before adding an issue, please search for any relevant entry in the [FAQ](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oic-auth-plugin/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md) or if the same issue has already be reported and avoid duplicating it. If it is a new issue and it not purely related to your environment, please provide relevant information (such as the version of Jenkins and the plugin).

If an issue or a feature request is unclear, it will be tagged with **Need more info** label. Without answer after a month, the issue will be closed.
