### CVE-2019-1003007

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Warnings Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint that compiles user-submitted Groovy scripts. This endpoint lacked sandbox protection and did not enforce POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing sandbox protection for the Groovy script compilation endpoint.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of POST request enforcement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins controller by injecting malicious Groovy scripts utilizing AST transforming annotations.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a user into submitting a crafted request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific permissions are needed beyond the ability to trigger the crafted request from a user's browser. The user needs to have some access, but it's not specified what access is needed.
- The attacker must convince a user to interact with a malicious link or page.
