Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- When using an external security realm (like LDAP or Active Directory), deleting a user from that realm did not invalidate their existing Jenkins sessions or "Remember me" cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Session Persistence:**  Even after a user was deleted from the external security realm, their active Jenkins sessions remained valid.
- **"Remember me" Cookie Persistence:** The "Remember me" cookies associated with deleted users remained valid, allowing continued access.
- **Lack of Session Invalidation:**  There was no mechanism to actively invalidate active sessions of users deleted from the external security realm other than restarting Jenkins or using other tools.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially maintain access to Jenkins even after the corresponding user account was deleted from the external security realm. This could allow an attacker to continue to execute malicious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers maintaining existing sessions could potentially escalate privileges or access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves compromising a user account that uses an external security realm.
- After deleting the user from the external realm, an attacker who had previously obtained a valid session or "remember me" cookie could maintain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a valid user account within the Jenkins instance that uses an external security realm.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the user deletion in the external realm.
- The attacker must have previously obtained a valid session or a 'Remember me' cookie associated with the user.

**Additional Information from Content:**

- This vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-901 within the Jenkins project.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
- The fix involves encoding a per-user seed value in sessions, 'Remember me' cookies, and cached authentications of the remoting-based CLI which can be reset by a user or administrator. Deleting a user record will now invalidate existing sessions, as the seed value is deleted.
- Affected versions include Jenkins weekly up to 2.159 and Jenkins LTS up to 2.150.1.
- The fix was implemented in Jenkins weekly version 2.160 and Jenkins LTS version 2.150.2.
- This vulnerability was reported by Nimrod Stoler of CyberArk Labs.
