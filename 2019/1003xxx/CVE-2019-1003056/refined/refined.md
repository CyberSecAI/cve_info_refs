Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WebSphere Deployer Plugin stores credentials unencrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The plugin stores deployment credentials in plain text within job `config.xml` files. This violates the principle of secure storage of sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system or have "Extended Read" permissions can view the unencrypted credentials. This exposure can lead to unauthorized access to the WebSphere deployments.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files.
- **Extended Read Permission:** Attackers with "Extended Read" permissions on Jenkins jobs can also access these files through the Jenkins interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Jenkins Controller Access:** Attackers need either access to the Jenkins controller file system or "Extended Read" permissions for the jobs that use the vulnerable plugin.
- **Knowledge of Jenkins Configuration:** The attacker needs to know where the credentials are stored (in the job `config.xml` files).

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is specific to the WebSphere Deployer plugin.
-   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities affecting various Jenkins plugins, all related to insecure storage of credentials.
-   The provided CVSS score is Medium.
-   The affected version is up to and including version 1.6.1.
