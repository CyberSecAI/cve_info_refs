Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003055:

**CVE-2019-1003055**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The FTP Publisher Plugin for Jenkins stores FTP credentials (usernames and passwords) in plain text within its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller's file system. The configuration file is named `com.zanox.hudson.plugins.FTPPublisher.xml`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials in an unencrypted format. This exposes the credentials to anyone with access to the Jenkins controller's file system.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the plugin's configuration file and obtain the stored FTP credentials. This would allow them to:
    *   Access and manipulate files on the FTP server, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities.
    *   Use the exposed credentials to gain access to other systems if the same credentials are reused.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any user, malicious actor, or malware with access to the Jenkins controller's file system, such as through a compromised server or insider threat.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved through various means, including:
        *   Compromising the Jenkins controller server.
        *   Having legitimate but unauthorized access to the server's file system (insider threat).
        *   Exploiting another vulnerability that grants file system access.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory also mentions that the FTP Publisher plugin has an additional vulnerability, tracked under CVE-2019-1003058 and CVE-2019-1003059.  Those CVEs deal with missing permission checks and CSRF in the same plugin, which allow for connections to arbitrary FTP servers, but it does not affect the issue of credential storage in plaintext which is the problem addressed by CVE-2019-1003055.
* The Jenkins advisory states that no fix is available for the plugin at the time of its release.

In summary, CVE-2019-1003055 is a vulnerability in the FTP Publisher Plugin for Jenkins that exposes FTP credentials due to their storage in plaintext on the Jenkins controller's file system. This can lead to unauthorized access to the FTP server and related data, if an attacker has access to the file system.
