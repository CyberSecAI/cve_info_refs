Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003081:

**CVE-2019-1003081**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in a form validation method within the OpenShift Deployer Plugin.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:**  Users with `Overall/Read` permissions can initiate a connection test. This lacks proper authorization, allowing unauthorized users to trigger the test.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server using attacker-specified credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems reachable from the Jenkins server.
    *   The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing actions on the Jenkins server, potentially leading to the same result as direct exploitation.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   **Malicious Link/Website:** Through CSRF, the attacker could trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that makes the request to the Jenkins server.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permissions in the Jenkins instance (or be able to trick an authenticated user through CSRF)
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide an arbitrary server address and credentials for the connection test.
    *   The attacker needs to have network access to the Jenkins instance and potentially to the target server for the connection test.

**Summary**
CVE-2019-1003081 describes a vulnerability in the OpenShift Deployer plugin where a missing permission check combined with a CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker with read access to trigger arbitrary connection tests to a server they control using credentials of their choosing.
