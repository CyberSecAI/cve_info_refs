Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-1003053:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The HockeyApp Plugin stores credentials in plain text within the job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys, tokens) without any encryption. This makes them easily readable if the config files are accessed.
- **Exposure via File System:** The credentials are stored on the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's file system, or with Extended Read permissions, can read and steal the stored credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access to HockeyApp:** With the stolen credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the associated HockeyApp resources and perform malicious actions within the scope of the compromised accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files where the credentials are stored in plain text.
- **Extended Read Permissions:** Users with Extended Read permissions within Jenkins can also view these files and extract the sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Jenkins Controller File System:** The attacker needs access to the file system of the Jenkins controller. This could be through direct access to the server, a compromised account on the server, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access.
- **Jenkins User with Extended Read Permissions:** An attacker who has obtained user credentials with the Extended Read permission can access the relevant job configuration files.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS score of 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), this implies that the attack is network based, can be performed with low effort, requires a low-privileged attacker with no user interaction and has a low impact on confidentiality.
- The `hockeyapp` plugin distribution has been suspended.
