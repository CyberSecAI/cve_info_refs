The provided content relates to CVE-2019-1003059.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The FTP publisher plugin has a missing permission check in a form validation method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check
- CSRF vulnerability due to missing POST request requirement

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can initiate a connection test to an arbitrary FTP server with attacker-specified credentials. This allows the attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive information on the target server, or to use the Jenkins server as a proxy for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious request to initiate the connection test using the vulnerable form validation method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission on the Jenkins instance.
