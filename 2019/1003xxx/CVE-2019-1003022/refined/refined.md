Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003022:

**CVE-2019-1003022**

*   **Root Cause:** The Monitoring Plugin did not properly apply CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, even when CSRF protection was enabled in Jenkins. This was due to the plugin using its own independent CSRF protection configuration for the embedded JavaMelody servlet and not checking the global Jenkins setting.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The plugin's JavaMelody servlet didn't enforce CSRF tokens for POST requests, even if Jenkins had CSRF protection enabled.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker could potentially perform actions within the Monitoring Plugin by tricking a user into submitting a crafted request. This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or possibly other unintended changes.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker could craft a malicious web page or email that, when opened by a logged-in Jenkins user, would make unauthorized requests to the Monitoring plugin's interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to entice a logged-in Jenkins user to visit a malicious page or interact with a crafted request. The user must have access to the Monitoring Plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory notes that the Monitoring Plugin only checks the Jenkins CSRF configuration on startup, therefore administrator needs to restart Jenkins when enabling or disabling the CSRF protection configuration to apply the change to Monitoring Plugin.
*   The vulnerability is specific to versions of the Monitoring Plugin up to and including 1.74.0.
*   The fix was introduced in version 1.75.0 of the plugin and now the plugin checks on startup whether Jenkins has CSRF protection enabled and enables its own CSRF protection accordingly.
