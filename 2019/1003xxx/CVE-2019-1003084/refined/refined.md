Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A missing permission check in a form validation method within the Zephyr Enterprise Test Management Plugin.
- The form validation method does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Permission Check:** Users with Overall/Read permissions can trigger the connection test. This allows lower-privileged users to perform actions they shouldn't be authorized to.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method not requiring POST requests makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker could trick a logged-in user into initiating a connection test to an arbitrary server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** By initiating a connection test to an attacker-specified server, an attacker can cause the Jenkins server to make requests to internal services or external servers. This could expose internal network resources or potentially lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker could exploit the missing permission check by initiating a connection test with a crafted request.
- The CSRF vulnerability could be exploited by tricking a logged-in user with Overall/Read permissions into visiting a malicious website or clicking a link that triggers the connection test.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs a way to trick a user with Overall/Read permissions (through CSRF) or have Overall/Read permissions directly.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to the Zephyr Enterprise Test Management plugin.
- The missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability are linked since the missing permission check is within a form validation method which also lacks CSRF protection.
- The impact is that an attacker could use the Jenkins server to initiate connections to arbitrary servers, which could lead to further exploitation such as accessing internal network resources.
