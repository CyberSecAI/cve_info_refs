Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-1003047:

**Root Cause:**
- Missing permission check in multiple form validation methods within the Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin did not properly verify user permissions before allowing access to form validation methods. This means users with *Overall/Read* access, who shouldn't have administrative privileges, could trigger these methods.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Because the validation methods allow a connection test to an arbitrary server, this could allow attackers to make requests to internal or external systems they shouldn't have access to by using the Jenkins server as an intermediary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users with *Overall/Read* access can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server. This can potentially be used to probe internal networks or interact with other systems. Although there's no direct data exfiltration mentioned, an attacker can use the Jenkins server to conduct reconnaissance on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to have *Overall/Read* permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must have access to the Jenkins instance over the network
- Must have *Overall/Read* permission on the Jenkins instance.
