The provided content contains information about CVE-2019-1003018.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GitHub Authentication Plugin stored the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration and transmitted it in plain text as part of the configuration form, without masking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The client secret, although stored encrypted on disk, was being transmitted and displayed in plain text within the configuration form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, or similar situations. This could allow an attacker to potentially compromise the integration between Jenkins and GitHub, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially intercept the plain text client secret during the transmission of the configuration form.
- An attacker could use browser extensions or XSS vulnerabilities to expose the client secret while it is displayed in the configuration form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to have access to the Jenkins instance's configuration form, typically requiring administrative privileges.
- The attacker may need to exploit browser extensions or other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects versions 0.29 and earlier of the GitHub Authentication Plugin.
- The fix involves encrypting the client secret during transmission when administrators view the global security configuration form.
