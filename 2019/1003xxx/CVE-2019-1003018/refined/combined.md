# Overview

The GitHub Authentication plugin provides a means of securing a Jenkins instance by offloading authentication and authorization to GitHub. The plugin authenticates by using a [GitHub OAuth Application](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/). It can use multiple authorization strategies for authorizing users. GitHub users are surfaced as Jenkins users for authorization. GitHub organizations and teams are surfaced as Jenkins groups for authorization. This plugin supports GitHub Enterprise.

## Setup

Before configuring the plugin you must create a GitHub application registration.

1. Visit <https://github.com/settings/applications/new> to create a GitHub application registration.
2. The values for application name, homepage URL, or application description don't matter. They can be customized however desired.
3. However, the authorization callback URL takes a specific value. It must be `https://jenkins.example.com/securityRealm/finishLogin` where jenkins.example.com is the location of the Jenkins server.

   The important part of the callback URL is `/securityRealm/finishLogin`
4. Finish by clicking *Register application*.

The *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* will be used to configure the Jenkins Security Realm. Keep the page open to the application registration so this information can be copied to your Jenkins configuration.

#### Security Realm in Global Security

The security realm in Jenkins controls authentication (i.e. you are who you say you are). The GitHub Authentication Plugin provides a security realm to authenticate Jenkins users via GitHub OAuth.

1. In the Global Security configuration choose the Security Realm to be **GitHub Authentication Plugin**.
2. The settings to configure are: GitHub Web URI, GitHub API URI, Client ID, Client Secret, and OAuth Scope(s).
3. If you're using GitHub Enterprise then the API URI is <https://ghe.example.com/api/v3>.

   The GitHub Enterprise API URI ends with `/api/v3`.
4. The recommended minimum [GitHub OAuth scopes](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes) are `read:org,user:email`.

   The recommended scopes are designed for using both authentication and authorization functions in the plugin. If only authentication is being used then the scope can be further limited to `(no scope)` or `user:email`.

In the plugin configuration pages each field has a little (‚ùì) next to it. Click on it for help about the setting.

#### Authorization in Global Security.

The authorization configuration in Jenkins controls what your users can do (i.e. read jobs, execute builds, administer permissions, etc.). The GitHub OAuth Plugin supports multiple ways of configuring authorization.

It is highly recommended that you configure the security realm and log in via GitHub OAuth before configuring authorization. This way Jenkins can look up and verify users and groups if configuring matrix-based authorization.

##### Github Committer Authorization Strategy

Control user authorization using the **Github Committer Authorization Strategy**. This is the simplest authorization strategy to get up and running. It handles authorization based on the git URL of a job and the type of access a user has to that project (i.e. Admin, Read/Write, Read-Only).

There is a way to authorize the use of the `/github-webhook` callback url to receive post commit hooks from GitHub. This authorization strategy has a checkbox that can allow GitHub POST data to be received. You will still need to run the [GitHub Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub%2BPlugin) to have the message trigger the build.

##### Logged-in users can do anything

There are a few ways to configure the plugin so that everyone on your team has `Overall/Administer` access.

1. Choose **Logged-in users can do anything** authorization strategy.
2. Choose one of the matrix-based authorization strategies. Set `authenticated` users to `Overall/Administer` permissions. Set `anonymous` users to have `Overall/Read` permissions and perhaps the `ViewStatus` permission.

##### Matrix-based Authorization strategy

Control user authorization using **Matrix-based security** or **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy**. Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy allows one to configure authorization globally per project and, when using Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy with the CloudBees folder plugin, per folder.

There are a few built-in authorizations to consider.

* `anonymous` - is anyone who has not logged in. Recommended permissions are just `Job/Discover` and `Job/ViewStatus`.
* `authenticated` - is anyone who has logged in. You can configure permissions for anybody who has logged into Jenkins. Recommended permissions are `Overall/Read` and `View/Read`.

  `anonymous` and `authenticated` usernames are case sensitive and must be lower case. This is a consideration when configuring authorizations via Groovy. Keep in mind that `anonymous` shows up as *Anonymous* in the Jenkins UI.

You can configure authorization based on GitHub users, organizations, or teams.

* `username` - give permissions to a specific GitHub username.
* `organization` - give permissions to every user that belongs to a specific GitHub organization.
* `organization*team` - give permissions to a specific GitHub team of a GitHub organization. Notice that organization and team are separated by an asterisk (`*`).

## Other usage

#### Calling Jenkins API using GitHub Personal Access Tokens

You can make Jenkins API calls by using a GitHub personal access token. One can still call the Jenkins API by using Jenkins tokens or use the Jenkins CLI with an SSH key for authentication. However, the GitHub OAuth plugin provides another way to call the Jenkins API by allowing the use of a GitHub Personal Access Token.

1. Generate a [GitHub *Personal Access Token*](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and give it only `read:org` scope.
2. Use a username and GitHub personal access token to authenticate with the Jenkins API.

Here's an example using curl to start a build using parameters (username `samrocketman` and password using the personal access token).

```
curl -X POST https://jenkins.example.com/job/_jervis_generator/build --user "samrocketman:myGitHubPersonalAccessToken" --data-urlencode json='{"parameter": [{"name":"project", "value":"samrocketman/jervis"}]}'

```

#### Automatically configure security realm via script console

Configuration management could be used to configure the security realm via the [Jenkins Script Console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BScript%2BConsole). Here's a sample configuring plugin version 0.22.

```
import hudson.security.SecurityRealm
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.GithubSecurityRealm
String githubWebUri = 'https://github.com'
String githubApiUri = 'https://api.github.com'
String clientID = 'someid'
String clientSecret = 'somesecret'
String oauthScopes = 'read:org'
SecurityRealm github_realm = new GithubSecurityRealm(githubWebUri, githubApiUri, clientID, clientSecret, oauthScopes)
//check for equality, no need to modify the runtime if no settings changed
if(!github_realm.equals(Jenkins.instance.getSecurityRealm())) {
    Jenkins.instance.setSecurityRealm(github_realm)
    Jenkins.instance.save()
}

```

#### Automatically configure authorization strategy via script console

Configuration management could be used to configure the authorization strategy via the [Jenkins Script Console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BScript%2BConsole). Here's a sample configuring plugin version 0.22.

```
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.GithubAuthorizationStrategy
import hudson.security.AuthorizationStrategy

//permissions are ordered similar to web UI
//Admin User Names
String adminUserNames = 'samrocketman'
//Participant in Organization
String organizationNames = ''
//Use Github repository permissions
boolean useRepositoryPermissions = true
//Grant READ permissions to all Authenticated Users
boolean authenticatedUserReadPermission = false
//Grant CREATE Job permissions to all Authenticated Users
boolean authenticatedUserCreateJobPermission = false
//Grant READ permissions for /github-webhook
boolean allowGithubWebHookPermission = false
//Grant READ permissions for /cc.xml
boolean allowCcTrayPermission = false
//Grant READ permissions for Anonymous Users
boolean allowAnonymousReadPermission = false
//Grant ViewStatus permissions for Anonymous Users
boolean allowAnonymousJobStatusPermission = false

AuthorizationStrategy github_authorization = new GithubAuthorizationStrategy(adminUserNames,
    authenticatedUserReadPermission,
    useRepositoryPermissions,
    authenticatedUserCreateJobPermission,
    organizationNames,
    allowGithubWebHookPermission,
    allowCcTrayPermission,
    allowAnonymousReadPermission,
    allowAnonymousJobStatusPermission)

//check for equality, no need to modify the runtime if no settings changed
if(!github_authorization.equals(Jenkins.instance.getAuthorizationStrategy())) {
    Jenkins.instance.setAuthorizationStrategy(github_authorization)
    Jenkins.instance.save()
}

```

## Troubleshooting Installation

After installing, the `<securityRealm>` class should have been updated in your `/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml` file. The value of `<clientID>` should agree with what you pasted into the admin UI. If it doesn't or you still can't log in, reset to `<securityRealm class="hudson.security.HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm">` and restart Jenkins from the command-line.

## Descriptions

### Sandbox Bypass in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1292
/
CVE-2019-1003005**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

This affected an HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script that was not covered in the [2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266](../2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266) and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration prohibiting unsafe AST transforming annotations.

### Sandbox Bypass in Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-1293
/
CVE-2019-1003006**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`groovy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/groovy)**

**Description:**

Groovy Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.

### Sandbox Bypass via CSRF in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1295 (1)
/
CVE-2019-1003007**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
The endpoint checked for the Overall/RunScripts permission, but did not require POST requests, so it was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
This allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.
Additionally, the form validation HTTP endpoint now requires that requests be sent via POST to prevent CSRF.

### Sandbox Bypass via CSRF in Warnings Next Generation Plugin

**SECURITY-1295 (2)
/
CVE-2019-1003008**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Next Generation Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
The endpoint checked for the Overall/RunScripts permission, but did not require POST requests, so it was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
This allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.
Additionally, the form validation HTTP endpoint now requires that requests be sent via POST to prevent CSRF.

### Improper certificate validation with StartTLS in Active Directory Plugin

**SECURITY-859
/
CVE-2019-1003009**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin performs TLS upgrade (StartTLS) after connecting to domain controllers through insecure LDAP.
In this mode, certificates were not properly validated, effectively trusting all certificates, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.

This only affected TLS upgrades.
The LDAPS mode, available by setting the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` to `true`, was unaffected.

The plugin now properly validates certificates according to the TLS trust configuration when performing a TLS upgrade.

### CSRF vulnerability in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-1095
/
CVE-2019-1003010**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

Git Plugin allows the creation of a tag in a job workspace‚Äôs Git repository with accompanying metadata attached to a build record.

The HTTP endpoint to create the tag did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The HTTP endpoint to create the tag now requires that requests are sent via POST.

### Recursive token expansion results in information disclosure and DoS in Token Macro Plugin

**SECURITY-1102
/
CVE-2019-1003011**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`token-macro`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/token-macro)**

**Description:**

Token Macro Plugin recursively applied token expansion.

This could be used by users able to affect input to token expansion (such as change log messages), to inject additional tokens into the input, which would then be expanded, resulting in information disclosure (for example values of environment variables), or denial of service.

Most tokens have been changed to no longer recursively apply token expansion.

### Blue Ocean did not require CSRF tokens

**SECURITY-1201
/
CVE-2019-1003012**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

Blue Ocean did not require CSRF tokens ("crumbs") for POST requests with the `Content-Type: application/json`.

Blue Ocean now requires that valid CSRF tokens are present in POST requests.

### XSS vulnerability via user description in Blue Ocean

**SECURITY-1204
/
CVE-2019-1003013**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

Blue Ocean did not properly escape HTML/JavaScript content set on the current user‚Äôs description field, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by administrators and other people accessing Jenkins with the same user account.

Blue Ocean now properly escapes HTML/JavaScript content set on the current user‚Äôs description field.

### XSS vulnerability in Config File Provider Plugin

**SECURITY-1253
/
CVE-2019-1003014**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`config-file-provider`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)**

**Description:**

Config File Provider Plugin improperly handled script names in its JavaScript-based UI, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Config File Provider Plugin now properly handles script names.

### XXE vulnerability in Job Import Plugin

**SECURITY-905 (1)
/
CVE-2019-1003015**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin allows to import jobs from other Jenkins instances.
As a first step in this process, Job Import Plugin sends a request to another Jenkins instance, parsing XML REST API output to obtain a list of jobs that could be imported.

Job Import Plugin did not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
This allowed attackers able to control either the server Jenkins will query, or the URL Jenkins queries, to have it parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

External entity resolution has been disabled for the XML parser used in Job Import Plugin 3.0.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Job Import Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-905 (2)
/
CVE-2019-1003016**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin did not check user permissions on its API endpoint used to access remote Jenkins instances.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Job Import Plugin 3.0 will only access Jenkins instances using credentials defined in the global configuration.

### CSRF vulnerability in Job Import Plugin allowed creating and overwriting jobs, installing some plugins

**SECURITY-1302
/
CVE-2019-1003017**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin did not require that POST requests are sent to its `/import` URL, which processes requests to import jobs.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that could be exploited to create or replace jobs on the local instance if the remote Jenkins instance has different ones with the same name, or to install additional plugins, if jobs on the remote Jenkins instance reference them in their configuration.

Job Import Plugin 3.0 restricted which remote Jenkins instances jobs can be imported from, limiting how this can be exploited.
From Job Import Plugin 3.1, the `/import` URL requires that requests are sent via POST.

### GitHub Authentication Plugin showed plain text client secret in configuration form

**SECURITY-602
/
CVE-2019-1003018**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin stores the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the client secret is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking.
This could result in exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

GitHub Authentication Plugin now encrypts the client secret transmitted to administrators viewing the global security configuration form.

### Session fixation vulnerability in GitHub Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-797
/
CVE-2019-1003019**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin did not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login, allowing attackers able to control or obtain another user‚Äôs pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

GitHub Authentication Plugin now invalidates the previous session during login and creates a new one.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Kanboard Plugin allowed server-side request forgery

**SECURITY-818
/
CVE-2019-1003020**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`kanboard`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kanboard)**

**Description:**

Kanboard Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to submit a GET request to an attacker-specified URL.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin showed plain text client secret in configuration form

**SECURITY-886
/
CVE-2019-1003021**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`oic-auth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/oic-auth)**

**Description:**

OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin stores the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the client secret is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking.
This could result in exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

The OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin now encrypts the client secret transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.

### Monitoring Plugin did not apply CSRF protection even if enabled in Jenkins

**SECURITY-1153
/
CVE-2019-1003022**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

Monitoring Plugin provides a standalone JavaMelody servlet with an independent CSRF protection configuration.
Even if Jenkins had CSRF protection enabled, Monitoring Plugin may not have it enabled.

Monitoring Plugin now checks on startup whether Jenkins has CSRF protection enabled and enables its own CSRF protection accordingly.

|  | Monitoring Plugin does not take into account configuration changes applied after Jenkins startup or after Monitoring Plugin finishes loading. Administrators need to restart Jenkins when enabling or disabling the CSRF protection configuration to apply the change to Monitoring Plugin. |

### Clickjacking vulnerability in Monitoring Plugin

**SECURITY-1154**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

Monitoring Plugin did not set the `X-Frame-Options` header, allowing its pages to be embedded.
This could result in clickjacking attacks.
