The provided content relates to CVE-2019-1003099.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a missing permission check in a form validation method within the OpenID Plugin, along with the absence of a requirement for POST requests for this method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: Users with Overall/Read permission can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL.
- CSRF Vulnerability: The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can make the Jenkins server initiate a connection test to an arbitrary URL they control (SSRF). This could be used for internal network scanning or to access resources not directly available to the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the form validation method of the OpenID Plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.
- No special position is needed. An attacker with the required permission can send the malicious request from anywhere, especially due to the CSRF vulnerability which does not require any specific network positioning.
