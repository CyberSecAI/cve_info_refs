Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-1003032:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Email Extension Plugin's Groovy sandbox protection could be bypassed during the parsing, compilation, and instantiation of Groovy scripts. This was due to a lack of proper security checks during these phases.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Sandbox Bypass:** The primary weakness was the ability to circumvent the intended sandbox restrictions, allowing execution of arbitrary code.
- **Insecure Script Handling:**  The plugin did not adequately sanitize or validate Groovy scripts during parsing, compilation, and instantiation, leading to the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could also use the arbitrary code execution to manipulate data or disrupt Jenkins' operation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Groovy Scripts:**  The attack vector involved providing specially crafted Groovy scripts that could bypass the sandbox.
- **Plugin Configuration Control:** Attackers needed the ability to control the plugin's job-specific configuration to inject the malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Jenkins Access:** The attacker requires access to a Jenkins instance with the vulnerable Email Extension plugin installed.
- **Job Configuration Control:** The attacker needs the ability to modify or configure jobs that use the Email Extension Plugin to insert the malicious Groovy scripts.
- **Overall/Read permission:** The attacker only needs Overall/Read permission.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affected multiple features within the Email Extension Plugin where sandboxed Groovy expressions were utilized.
- The fix involves using Script Security APIs, which provide proper sandbox protection during parsing, compilation, and instantiation.
- The advisory also provides a CVSS score of High (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) for this vulnerability.
