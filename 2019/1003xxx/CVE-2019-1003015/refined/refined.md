```
Vulnerability: XXE vulnerability
CVE-2019-1003015
Plugin: Job Import Plugin

Root cause:
The Job Import Plugin's XML parser was not configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing when parsing XML REST API output from other Jenkins instances to obtain a list of jobs.

Attack vector:
An attacker could control either the server Jenkins queries or the URL Jenkins queries, to have it parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities.

Impact:
Exploitation could lead to:
- Extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Required capabilities:
The attacker needs to be able to control either the server Jenkins will query, or the URL Jenkins queries.
An attacker also needs Overall/Read access to Jenkins.

Affected versions:
Job Import Plugin up to and including 3.0

Mitigation:
External entity resolution has been disabled for the XML parser used in Job Import Plugin 3.0.
Update Job Import Plugin to version 3.0 or higher.
