{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Jenkins Script Security and Pipeline: Groovy Plugins that allowed for sandbox bypass via type casts and type coercion. This enabled attackers to invoke constructors for arbitrary types.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sandbox protection",
      "Unrestricted type casting and coercion",
      "Arbitrary constructor invocation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass sandbox restrictions, leading to potential data confidentiality and integrity compromise, and system availability issues.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation through methods supporting type casts and coercion"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to execute scripts within the Jenkins environment."
