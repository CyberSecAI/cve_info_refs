[![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/slack-plugin@master/docs/plugin-manager-search.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/blob/master/docs/plugin-manager-search.png)

3. Continue to the next section to create your Slack app.

### Creating your app

1. Go to <https://api.slack.com/apps> and click "Create New App".
2. Click `From an app manifest`
3. Select your workspace
4. Delete the example manifest that Slack provides
5. Click YAML
6. Paste the following into the text box:

```
display_information:
  name: Jenkins
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: Jenkins
    always_online: true
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - channels:read
      - chat:write
      - chat:write.customize
      - files:write
      - reactions:write
      - users:read
      - users:read.email
      - groups:read
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

7. Click "Next"
8. Click "Create"
9. Click "Install App to Workspace"
10. Click "Allow"
11. Click "OAuth & Permissions" in the sidebar
12. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Access Token"
13. *On Jenkins*: Find the Slack configuration in "Manage Jenkins → System".
    1. *On Jenkins*: Click "Add" to create a new "Secret text" Credential with the bot user token.
    2. *On Jenkins*: Select the new "Secret text" in the dropdown.
    3. *On Jenkins*: Add a default channel (this can be removed after validating the connection works).
    4. *On Jenkins*: Tick the "Custom slack app bot user" option.
14. Invite the Jenkins bot user into the Slack channel(s) you wish to be notified in.
15. *On Jenkins*: Click test connection. A message will be sent to the default channel / default member.

### Notify for all jobs

If you want to configure a notification to be sent to Slack for **all jobs**, you may want to also consider installing an additional plugin called [Global Slack Notifier plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/global-slack-notifier).

### Pipeline job

```
slackSend color: "good", message: "Message from Jenkins Pipeline"

```

Additionally you can pass attachments or blocks (requires [bot user](#plugin-content-bot-user-mode)) in order to send complex messages, for example:

Attachments:

```
def attachments = [
  [
    text: 'I find your lack of faith disturbing!',
    fallback: 'Hey, Vader seems to be mad at you.',
    color: '#ff0000'
  ]
]

slackSend(channel: "#general", attachments: attachments)
```

Blocks (this feature requires a '[bot user](#plugin-content-bot-user-mode)' and a custom slack app):

```
blocks = [
	[
		"type": "section",
		"text": [
			"type": "mrkdwn",
			"text": "Hello, Assistant to the Regional Manager Dwight! *Michael Scott* wants to know where you'd like to take the Paper Company investors to dinner tonight.\n\n *Please select a restaurant:*"
		]
	],
    [
		"type": "divider"
	],
	[
		"type": "section",
		"text": [
			"type": "mrkdwn",
			"text": "*Farmhouse Thai Cuisine*\n:star::star::star::star: 1528 reviews\n They do have some vegan options, like the roti and curry, plus they have a ton of salad stuff and noodles can be ordered without meat!! They have something for everyone here"
		],
		"accessory": [
			"type": "image",
			"image_url": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c7ed05m9lC2EmA3Aruue7A/o.jpg",
			"alt_text": "alt text for image"
		]
	]
]

slackSend(channel: "#general", blocks: blocks)
```

For more information about slack messages see [Slack Messages Api](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages), [Slack attachments Api](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments) and [Block kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit)

Note: the attachments API is classified as legacy, with blocks as the replacement (but blocks are only supported when using a bot user through a custom slack app).

#### File upload

You can upload files to slack with this plugin:

```
node {
  sh "echo hey > blah.txt"
  slackUploadFile filePath: "*.txt", initialComment:  "HEY HEY"
}
```

This feature requires [botUser](#plugin-content-bot-user-mode) mode.

##### File upload to a user channel

You can upload files to a user channel by messaging the user first and then using the channel ID from the message response:

```
node {
  sh "echo hey > blah.txt"
  def slackResponse = slackSend channel: '$userId', message: 'Hey', sendAsText: true
  slackUploadFile filePath: "*.txt", channel: slackResponse.channelId
}
```

#### Threads Support

You can send a message and create a thread on that message using the pipeline step. The step returns an object which you can use to retrieve the thread ID. Send new messages with that thread ID as the target channel to create a thread. All messages of a thread should use the same thread ID.

Example:

```
def slackResponse = slackSend(channel: "cool-threads", message: "Here is the primary message")
slackSend(channel: slackResponse.threadId, message: "Thread reply #1")
slackSend(channel: slackResponse.threadId, message: "Thread reply #2")
```

This feature requires [botUser](#plugin-content-bot-user-mode) mode.

Messages that are posted to a thread can also optionally be broadcasted to the channel. Set `replyBroadcast: true` to do so. For example:

```
def slackResponse = slackSend(channel: "ci", message: "Started build")
slackSend(channel: slackResponse.threadId, message: "Build still in progress")
slackSend(
    channel: slackResponse.threadId,
    replyBroadcast: true,
    message: "Build failed. Broadcast to channel for better visibility."
)
```

If you wish to upload a file to a thread, you can do so by specifying the channel, and the timestamp of the thread you want to add the file to, separated by a colon. For example:

```
def slackResponse = slackSend(channel: "cool-threads", message: "Here is the primary message")
sh "echo hey > blah.txt"
slackUploadFile(channel: "cool-threads:" + slackResponse.ts, filePath: "*.txt", initialComment:  "A file, inside a thread.")
```

#### Update Messages

You can update the content of a previously sent message using the pipeline step. The step returns an object which you can use to retrieve the timestamp and channelId NOTE: The slack API requires the channel ID for `chat.update` calls.

Example:

```
def slackResponse = slackSend(channel: "updating-stuff", message: "Here is the primary message")
slackSend(channel: slackResponse.channelId, message: "Update message now", timestamp: slackResponse.ts)
```

This feature requires [botUser](#plugin-content-bot-user-mode) mode.

#### Emoji Reactions

Add an emoji reaction to a previously-sent message like this:

Example:

```
def slackResponse = slackSend(channel: "emoji-demo", message: "Here is the primary message")
slackResponse.addReaction("thumbsup")
```

[![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/slack-plugin@master/docs/emoji-reaction.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/blob/master/docs/emoji-reaction.png)

You can remove an emoji reaction to a previously-sent message like this:

Example:

```
def slackResponse = slackSend(channel: "emoji-demo", message: "Here is the primary message")
slackResponse.addReaction("thumbsup")
// ... do some stuff
slackResponse.removeReaction("thumbsup")
```

This may only work reliably in channels (as opposed to private messages) due to [limitations in the Slack API](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) (See "Post to an IM channel").

This does not currently work in a situation where Jenkins is restarted between sending the initial message and adding the reaction. If this is something you need, please file an issue.

This feature requires [botUser](#plugin-content-bot-user-mode) mode and the `reactions:write` API scope.

#### Unfurling Links

You can allow link unfurling if you send the message as text. This only works in a text message, as attachments cannot be unfurled.

Example:

```
slackSend(channel: "news-update", message: "https://www.nytimes.com", sendAsText: true)
```

#### User Id Look Up

There are two pipeline steps available to help with user id look up.

A user id can be resolved from a user's email address with the `slackUserIdFromEmail` step.

Example:

```
def userId = slackUserIdFromEmail('spengler@ghostbusters.example.com')
slackSend(color: "good", message: "<@$userId> Message from Jenkins Pipeline")
```

A list of user ids can be resolved against the set of changeset commit authors with the `slackUserIdsFromCommitters` step.

Example:

```
def userIds = slackUserIdsFromCommitters()
def userIdsString = userIds.collect { "<@$it>" }.join(' ')
slackSend(color: "good", message: "$userIdsString Message from Jenkins Pipeline")
```

This feature requires [botUser](#plugin-content-bot-user-mode) mode and the `users:read` and `users:read.email` API scopes.

#### Colors

*Warning: This functionality is not supported if you are using the `blocks` layout mode*

Any hex triplet (i.e. `'#AA1100'`) can be used for the color of the message. There are also three builtin color options:

| Name | Color |
| --- | --- |
| `good` | green |
| `warning` | yellow |
| `danger` | red |

### Freestyle job

1. Configure it in your Jenkins job (and optionally as global configuration) and **add it as a Post-build action**.

## Security

Use Jenkins Credentials and a credential ID to configure the Slack integration token. It is a security risk to expose your integration token using the previous *Integration Token* setting.

Create a new ***Secret text*** credential:

[![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/983526/17971588/6c26dfa0-6aa9-11e6-808c-3e139446e013.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/983526/17971588/6c26dfa0-6aa9-11e6-808c-3e139446e013.png)

Select that credential as the value for the ***Credential*** field:

[![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/slack-plugin@master/docs/global-config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/blob/master/docs/global-config.png)

## Direct Message

You can send messages to channels or you can notify individual users via their slackbot. In order to notify an individual user, use the syntax `@user_id` in place of the project channel. Mentioning users by display name may work, but it is not unique and will not work if it is an ambiguous match.

## User Mentions

Use the syntax `<@user_id>` in a message to mention users directly. See [User Id Look Up](#plugin-content-user-id-look-up) for pipeline steps to help with user id look up.

## Configuration as code

This plugin supports configuration as code Add to your yaml file:

```
credentials:
  system:
    domainCredentials:
      - credentials:
          - string:
              scope: GLOBAL
              id: slack-token
              secret: '${SLACK_TOKEN}'
              description: Slack token

unclassified:
  slackNotifier:
    teamDomain: <your-slack-workspace-name> # i.e. your-company (just the workspace name not the full url)
    tokenCredentialId: slack-token
    botUser: true
```

For more details see the configuration as code plugin documentation: <https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin#getting-started>

## Troubleshooting connection failure

When testing the connection, you may see errors like:

```
    WARNING j.p.slack.StandardSlackService#publish: Response Code: 404

```

There's a couple of things to try:

### Have you enabled bot user mode?

If you've ticked `Custom slack app bot user` then try unticking it, that mode is for when you've created a custom app and installed it to your workspace instead of the default Jenkins app made by Slack

### Have you set the override URL?

If you've entered something into `Override url` then try clearing it out, that field is only needed for slack compatible apps like mattermost.

### Enable additional logging

Add a [log recorder](https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/204880580-How-do-I-create-a-logger-in-Jenkins-for-troubleshooting-and-diagnostic-information-) for the [StandardSlackService](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/jenkins/plugins/slack/StandardSlackService.java) class this should give you additional details on what's going on.

If you still can't figure it out please raise an issue with as much information as possible about your config and any relevant logs.

## Developer instructions

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugins:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)
,

[`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in the Script Security and Pipeline: Groovy Plugins could be circumvented through methods supporting type casts and type coercion.
This allowed attackers to invoke constructors for arbitrary types.

Script Security and Pipeline: Groovy have been hardened to prevent these methods of bypassing sandbox protection.

### XSS vulnerability in Lockable Resources Plugin

**SECURITY-1361
/
CVE-2019-1003042**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`lockable-resources`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/lockable-resources)**

**Description:**

Lockable Resources Plugin did not properly escape resource names in generated JavaScript code, thus leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The plugin now properly escapes resource names in its scripts.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Slack Notification Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-976
/
CVE-2019-1003043 (missing permission check) and CVE-2019-1003044 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`slack`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack)**

**Description:**

Slack Notification Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for global configuration) or Item/Configure permissions (for job configuration).

### ECS Publisher Plugin stored and displayed API token in plain text

**SECURITY-846
/
CVE-2019-1003045**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ecs-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ecs-publisher)**

**Description:**

ECS Publisher Plugin stored the API token unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This token could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the API token was not masked from view using a password form field.

The plugin now stores the API token encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### SSRF vulnerability due to missing permission check in Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin

**SECURITY-992
/
CVE-2019-1003046 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-1003047 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in multiple form validation methods in Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.

Additionally, the form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The form validation methods now require POST requests and perform a permission check.

### PRQA Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1089
/
CVE-2019-1003048**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`prqa-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/prqa-plugin)**

**Description:**

PRQA Plugin stored a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk.

### Codebeamer Test Results Trend Updater Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1086**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`codebeamer-result-trend-updater`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/codebeamer-result-trend-updater)**

**Description:**

Codebeamer Test Results Trend Updater Plugin stored username and password in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now integrates with [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials).

### Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access were able to enumerate credential IDs in Arxan MAM Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-1328**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ease-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ease-plugin)**

**Description:**

Arxan MAM Publisher Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
