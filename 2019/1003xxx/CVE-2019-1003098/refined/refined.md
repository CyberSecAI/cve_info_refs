Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-1003098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a missing permission check in a form validation method within the OpenID Plugin for Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The form validation method lacks proper authorization checks, allowing users with the `Overall/Read` permission to initiate connection tests to arbitrary URLs.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. This means an attacker can trick a legitimate user into initiating a request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, potentially interacting with internal services or resources not meant to be exposed publicly. The ability to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL allows the attacker to probe the internal network or other services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely through the Jenkins web interface.
*   **User Interaction:** The CSRF aspect requires a victim user with `Overall/Read` permissions to be tricked into initiating the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of a vulnerable Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker requires a user with `Overall/Read` permissions to be logged into the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious request to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in the OpenID plugin up to and including version 2.3.
*   The provided information gives more specific details than the placeholder CVE description.
*   The advisory also lists many other vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins.
