| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1690665#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-03-20 01:02:31 UTC  ``` The Jenkins Pipeline: Groovy sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.  This allowed users able to control the contents of a pipeline to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.  Pipeline: Groovy Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.    External Reference:  <https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-03-06/#SECURITY-1336%20(2>)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1690665#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-10 18:34:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:0739 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0739](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0739)   ``` |  |

## Descriptions

### Sandbox Bypass in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1292
/
CVE-2019-1003005**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

This affected an HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script that was not covered in the [2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266](../2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266) and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration prohibiting unsafe AST transforming annotations.

### Sandbox Bypass in Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-1293
/
CVE-2019-1003006**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`groovy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/groovy)**

**Description:**

Groovy Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.

### Sandbox Bypass via CSRF in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1295 (1)
/
CVE-2019-1003007**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
The endpoint checked for the Overall/RunScripts permission, but did not require POST requests, so it was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
This allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.
Additionally, the form validation HTTP endpoint now requires that requests be sent via POST to prevent CSRF.

### Sandbox Bypass via CSRF in Warnings Next Generation Plugin

**SECURITY-1295 (2)
/
CVE-2019-1003008**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Next Generation Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
The endpoint checked for the Overall/RunScripts permission, but did not require POST requests, so it was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
This allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.
Additionally, the form validation HTTP endpoint now requires that requests be sent via POST to prevent CSRF.

### Improper certificate validation with StartTLS in Active Directory Plugin

**SECURITY-859
/
CVE-2019-1003009**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`active-directory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/active-directory)**

**Description:**

Active Directory Plugin performs TLS upgrade (StartTLS) after connecting to domain controllers through insecure LDAP.
In this mode, certificates were not properly validated, effectively trusting all certificates, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.

This only affected TLS upgrades.
The LDAPS mode, available by setting the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` to `true`, was unaffected.

The plugin now properly validates certificates according to the TLS trust configuration when performing a TLS upgrade.

### CSRF vulnerability in Git Plugin

**SECURITY-1095
/
CVE-2019-1003010**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`git`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git)**

**Description:**

Git Plugin allows the creation of a tag in a job workspace’s Git repository with accompanying metadata attached to a build record.

The HTTP endpoint to create the tag did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The HTTP endpoint to create the tag now requires that requests are sent via POST.

### Recursive token expansion results in information disclosure and DoS in Token Macro Plugin

**SECURITY-1102
/
CVE-2019-1003011**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`token-macro`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/token-macro)**

**Description:**

Token Macro Plugin recursively applied token expansion.

This could be used by users able to affect input to token expansion (such as change log messages), to inject additional tokens into the input, which would then be expanded, resulting in information disclosure (for example values of environment variables), or denial of service.

Most tokens have been changed to no longer recursively apply token expansion.

### Blue Ocean did not require CSRF tokens

**SECURITY-1201
/
CVE-2019-1003012**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

Blue Ocean did not require CSRF tokens ("crumbs") for POST requests with the `Content-Type: application/json`.

Blue Ocean now requires that valid CSRF tokens are present in POST requests.

### XSS vulnerability via user description in Blue Ocean

**SECURITY-1204
/
CVE-2019-1003013**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`blueocean`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean)**

**Description:**

Blue Ocean did not properly escape HTML/JavaScript content set on the current user’s description field, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by administrators and other people accessing Jenkins with the same user account.

Blue Ocean now properly escapes HTML/JavaScript content set on the current user’s description field.

### XSS vulnerability in Config File Provider Plugin

**SECURITY-1253
/
CVE-2019-1003014**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`config-file-provider`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider)**

**Description:**

Config File Provider Plugin improperly handled script names in its JavaScript-based UI, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Config File Provider Plugin now properly handles script names.

### XXE vulnerability in Job Import Plugin

**SECURITY-905 (1)
/
CVE-2019-1003015**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[high](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin allows to import jobs from other Jenkins instances.
As a first step in this process, Job Import Plugin sends a request to another Jenkins instance, parsing XML REST API output to obtain a list of jobs that could be imported.

Job Import Plugin did not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
This allowed attackers able to control either the server Jenkins will query, or the URL Jenkins queries, to have it parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

External entity resolution has been disabled for the XML parser used in Job Import Plugin 3.0.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Job Import Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-905 (2)
/
CVE-2019-1003016**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin did not check user permissions on its API endpoint used to access remote Jenkins instances.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Job Import Plugin 3.0 will only access Jenkins instances using credentials defined in the global configuration.

### CSRF vulnerability in Job Import Plugin allowed creating and overwriting jobs, installing some plugins

**SECURITY-1302
/
CVE-2019-1003017**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin did not require that POST requests are sent to its `/import` URL, which processes requests to import jobs.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that could be exploited to create or replace jobs on the local instance if the remote Jenkins instance has different ones with the same name, or to install additional plugins, if jobs on the remote Jenkins instance reference them in their configuration.

Job Import Plugin 3.0 restricted which remote Jenkins instances jobs can be imported from, limiting how this can be exploited.
From Job Import Plugin 3.1, the `/import` URL requires that requests are sent via POST.

### GitHub Authentication Plugin showed plain text client secret in configuration form

**SECURITY-602
/
CVE-2019-1003018**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin stores the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the client secret is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking.
This could result in exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

GitHub Authentication Plugin now encrypts the client secret transmitted to administrators viewing the global security configuration form.

### Session fixation vulnerability in GitHub Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-797
/
CVE-2019-1003019**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin did not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login, allowing attackers able to control or obtain another user’s pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

GitHub Authentication Plugin now invalidates the previous session during login and creates a new one.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Kanboard Plugin allowed server-side request forgery

**SECURITY-818
/
CVE-2019-1003020**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`kanboard`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/kanboard)**

**Description:**

Kanboard Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to submit a GET request to an attacker-specified URL.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin showed plain text client secret in configuration form

**SECURITY-886
/
CVE-2019-1003021**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`oic-auth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/oic-auth)**

**Description:**

OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin stores the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the client secret is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking.
This could result in exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

The OpenId Connect Authentication Plugin now encrypts the client secret transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.

### Monitoring Plugin did not apply CSRF protection even if enabled in Jenkins

**SECURITY-1153
/
CVE-2019-1003022**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

Monitoring Plugin provides a standalone JavaMelody servlet with an independent CSRF protection configuration.
Even if Jenkins had CSRF protection enabled, Monitoring Plugin may not have it enabled.

Monitoring Plugin now checks on startup whether Jenkins has CSRF protection enabled and enables its own CSRF protection accordingly.

|  | Monitoring Plugin does not take into account configuration changes applied after Jenkins startup or after Monitoring Plugin finishes loading. Administrators need to restart Jenkins when enabling or disabling the CSRF protection configuration to apply the change to Monitoring Plugin. |
| --- | --- |

### Clickjacking vulnerability in Monitoring Plugin

**SECURITY-1154**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`monitoring`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/monitoring)**

**Description:**

Monitoring Plugin did not set the `X-Frame-Options` header, allowing its pages to be embedded.
This could result in clickjacking attacks.

Monitoring Plugin now sets the `X-Frame-Options` header to `sameorigin`, preventing embedding.

### XSS vulnerability in Warnings Next Generation Plugin

**SECURITY-1271
/
CVE-2019-1003023**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not properly escape HTML content in warnings displayed on the Jenkins UI, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to control warnings parser input.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1684556#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2019-03-01 14:26:48 UTC  ``` The previously implemented script security sandbox protections prohibiting the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations such as @Grab (2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266) could be circumvented through use of various Groovy language features:  * Use of AnnotationCollector * Import aliasing * Referencing annotation types using their full class name  This allowed users with Overall/Read permission, or the ability to control Jenkinsfile or sandboxed Pipeline shared library contents in SCM, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.  Using AnnotationCollector is now newly prohibited in sandboxed scripts such as Pipelines. Importing any of the annotations considered unsafe will now result in an error. During the compilation phase, both simple and full class names of prohibited annotations are rejected for element annotations.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1684556#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2019-03-01 14:26:50 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-02-19/#SECURITY-1320>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1684556#c2)  Andrej Nemec    2019-03-01 14:27:16 UTC  ``` Created jenkins-script-security-plugin tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1684557](show_bug.cgi?id=1684557 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-1003024 jenkins-script-security-plugin: jenkins-plugin-script-security: Sandbox Bypass in Script Security Plugin (SECURITY-1320) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1684556#c3)  Sam Fowler    2019-03-04 03:22:23 UTC  ``` Upstream Patch:  <https://github.com/jenkinsci/script-security-plugin/commit/3228c88e>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1684556#c5)  Sam Fowler    2019-03-22 01:41:29 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw affects the jenkins-2-plugins RPM which is installed in the openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7 container image.

The Jenkins Next Generation Warnings plugin collects compiler warnings or issues reported by static analysis tools and visualizes the results. It has built-in support for more than a hundred [report formats](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/SUPPORTED-FORMATS.md). Among the problems it can detect:

* errors from your compiler (C, C#, Java, etc.)
* warnings from a static analysis tool (CheckStyle, StyleCop, SpotBugs, etc.)
* duplications from a copy-and-paste detector (CPD, Simian, etc.)
* vulnerabilities
* open tasks in comments of your source files

The plugin publishes a report of the issues found in your build, so you can navigate to a summary report from the main build page. From there you can also dive into the details:

* distribution of new, fixed and outstanding issues
* distribution of the issues by severity, category, type, module, or package
* list of all issues including helpful comments from the reporting tool
* annotated source code of the affected files
* trend charts of the issues over time

[![Jenkins Warnings Plug-in](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin@main/doc/images/jenkins.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/doc/images/jenkins.png)

This code of this plugin is also available as a standalone GitHub or GitLab action that runs without Jenkins now:

* [Quality Monitor GitHub Action](https://github.com/uhafner/quality-monitor): action that monitors the quality of projects based on a configurable set of metrics and gives feedback on pull requests (or single commits) in GitHub.
* [GitHub Autograding action](https://github.com/uhafner/autograding-github-action): action that automatically grades student software projects based on a configurable set of metrics and gives feedback on pull requests (or single commits) in GitHub.
* [GitLab Autograding action](https://github.com/uhafner/autograding-gitlab-action): action that automatically grades student software projects based on a configurable set of metrics and gives feedback on merge requests (or single commits) in GitLab.

[![Quality Monitor GitHub Action](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin@main/doc/images/quality-monitor.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/doc/images/quality-monitor.png)

If you are using Git as a source code management system then the warnings plugin will optionally mine the repository in the style of [Code as a Crime Scene](https://www.adamtornhill.com/articles/crimescene/codeascrimescene.htm) (Adam Tornhill, November 2013) to determine statistics of the affected files (i.e. the files with issues):

* commits count
* different authors count
* creation time
* last modification time
* lines of code (from the commit details)
* code churn (changed lines since created)

Additionally, the plugin shows the last person who modified the code that contains an issue (and the last commit ID). In order to use this functionality you need to install the optional [Git Forensics Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-forensics-plugin).

If your tool is not yet supported by the warnings plugin you can either define a new Groovy based parser in the user interface or provide a parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams as well please share it and provide pull requests for the [Warnings Next Generation Plug-in](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls) and the [Analysis Parsers Library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls).

For more details please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/doc/Documentation.md) or to an [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GcEqML8nys). Contributions are welcome, please refer to the separate [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for details on how to proceed!

The fix for CVE-2019-1003000 was found to be incomplete.

This affected an HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script that was not covered in the 2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266 and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master. The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration prohibiting unsafe AST transforming annotations. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2019-06-10 10:46:38 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1670283#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-01-29 07:24:25 UTC  ``` Jenkins Script Security plugin through version 1.50 is vulnerable to an incomplete fix to [CVE-2019-1003000](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-1003000).  Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as @Grab to source code elements.  This affected an HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script that was not covered in the 2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266 and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.  The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration prohibiting unsafe AST transforming annotations.
