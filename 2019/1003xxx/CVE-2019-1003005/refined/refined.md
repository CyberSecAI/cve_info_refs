  "CVE-2019-1003005": {
    "description": "Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements. This affected an HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script that was not covered in the 2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266 and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller. The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration prohibiting unsafe AST transforming annotations.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2019-1003000, allowing AST transforming annotations such as @Grab to bypass the Script Security sandbox.",
