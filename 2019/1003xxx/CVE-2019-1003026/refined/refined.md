Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1003026:

**Root Cause:**

*   A missing permission check in a form validation method within the Mattermost Notification Plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate a connection test to an arbitrary Mattermost server.
*   **Missing Permission Check:**  The form validation method lacks a proper permission check, allowing unauthorized users to trigger the connection test.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation method did not require POST requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can make the Jenkins server connect to an attacker-controlled Mattermost server and room.
*   The attacker can cause the Jenkins server to post a message to the attacker-controlled Mattermost server and room
*   This allows for potential information disclosure, or further attacks targeting the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins server and the attacker's specified Mattermost server.
*   **Web Request:** The attacker makes a web request to the form validation endpoint of the Mattermost plugin

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the Jenkins server with at least Overall/Read permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the Jenkins server over the network and be able to host their own Mattermost instance.
