Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003046:

**CVE-2019-1003046**

*   **Root Cause:** The Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin had missing permission checks in its form validation methods and did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin lacked proper permission checks, allowing users with Overall/Read permission to trigger connection tests to arbitrary servers.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** Form validation methods did not require POST requests making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially initiate a connection test to an attacker-controlled server. This can be leveraged for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and potentially lead to further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A user with Overall/Read permissions could initiate a connection to an attacker-specified server using a crafted request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance and ability to craft a malicious request, which the Jenkins user has to interact with.
