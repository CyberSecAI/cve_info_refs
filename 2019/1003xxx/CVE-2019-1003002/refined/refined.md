{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Jenkins' dynamic routing and Groovy metaprogramming capabilities. Specifically, the Script Security sandbox protection can be bypassed during script compilation by using AST transforming annotations like `@Grab`. This allows for the injection of malicious code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "ACL Bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing the Overall/Read ACL, which normally restricts access.",
      "Metaprogramming Abuse: Groovy metaprogramming features, like the `@Grab` annotation, are exploited to download and execute malicious JAR files.",
      "Sandbox Evasion: The Script Security sandbox, designed to limit the capabilities of scripts, is circumvented through AST transformation during the compilation phase."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller. This can lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance and potentially the underlying infrastructure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests: Specifically crafted HTTP requests to Jenkins are used to trigger the vulnerability through the dynamic routing mechanism.",
      "Groovy Metaprogramming: The `@Grab` annotation within Groovy scripts is leveraged to download and execute malicious JAR files from attacker controlled servers.",
      "Pipeline scripts: Malicious code can be injected into Jenkinsfile or sandboxed pipeline shared library content stored in SCM."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.",
       "Overall/Read permissions: An attacker can use this vulnerability if they have overall read permissions, or control the content of Jenkinsfile or sandboxed pipeline shared library.",
      "Malicious payload hosting: The attacker needs to host a malicious JAR file on a server accessible by the Jenkins instance."
    ]
