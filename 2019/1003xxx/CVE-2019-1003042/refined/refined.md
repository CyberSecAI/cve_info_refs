Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1003042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `Lockable Resources Plugin` for Jenkins did not properly sanitize resource names when generating JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a page displaying resources managed by the vulnerable plugin. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the Jenkins UI
    *   Potentially gaining access to sensitive data accessible through the Jenkins interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting resource names that contain malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify resource names within the Jenkins environment where the Lockable Resources plugin is installed and active. This typically requires a low level of authenticated access to Jenkins.
* The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access
* The attacker needs the victim to view a page that is displaying the unsanitized resource names

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as `SECURITY-1361` within the Jenkins project.
*   The fix for this issue involves properly escaping resource names in the plugin's JavaScript code.
*   The affected plugin version is up to and including 2.4 and the fix is in version 2.5.
*   Red Hat has issued a security advisory `RHSA-2019:1423` to address this vulnerability in their OpenShift Container Platform.
