  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-1003000",
    "description": "The Script Security plugin allowed sandbox bypass during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations, such as @Grab, to source code elements. This vulnerability affects both the pipeline validation REST APIs and actual script/pipeline execution. Users with Overall/Read permission, or able to control Jenkinsfile or sandboxed Pipeline shared library contents in SCM could bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller. All known unsafe AST transformations in Groovy are now prohibited in sandboxed scripts.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Script Security Plugin",
      "Pipeline: Groovy Plugin",
      "Pipeline: Declarative Plugin"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks during the script compilation phase, allowing AST transforming annotations like @Grab to be used by sandboxed scripts. This allowed a bypass of the intended restrictions of the sandbox.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Improper access control",
      "Groovy sandboxing bypass"
    ],
     "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller, leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to the Jenkins server",
      "Jenkinsfile modifications",
      "Changes to sandboxed Pipeline shared libraries in SCM"
   ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance or the ability to control Jenkinsfile or Pipeline shared library contents in the SCM.",
