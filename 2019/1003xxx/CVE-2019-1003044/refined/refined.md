Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003044:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Slack Notification Plugin's form validation method did not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of a requirement for POST requests made the form validation method vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially trick a user into submitting a crafted request that would allow them to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs. This could allow for the capture of credentials stored within Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious link or web page that, when accessed by a victim with Overall/Read access, would trigger the vulnerable form validation method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins into visiting a malicious link or webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

* This CVE is related to CVE-2019-1003043 which describes a missing permission check in the same form validation method. These vulnerabilities have been addressed in version 2.20 of the Slack Notification plugin.
