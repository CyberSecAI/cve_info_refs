Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The PRQA Plugin stored a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of a password in plaintext within the global configuration file. This is a common security flaw.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability highlights the lack of proper access control.  Users with access to the Jenkins controller file system were able to view the stored password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's filesystem can obtain the plaintext password, enabling them to potentially gain unauthorized access to systems or resources secured by that password.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** This allows unauthorized viewing of sensitive information, which goes against data privacy principles.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:**  The attack vector involves gaining access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be through various means, including compromised accounts, vulnerabilities in the OS, or misconfigured systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Jenkins Controller's File System:**  An attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the global configuration file. This could be achieved through compromised accounts with appropriate privileges or by exploiting OS-level vulnerabilities.
- **Local Access:**  The CVE description specifies that access to the Jenkins controller file system is required and based on the CVSS score (AV:L), this indicates local access.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 3.1.0 of the PRQA Plugin.
- The fix involves storing the password encrypted in the configuration files.
- The severity is rated as "Low"
