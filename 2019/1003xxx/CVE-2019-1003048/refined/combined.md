# Intellectual Property Update

The PRQA product has become Helix QAC and Programming Research has become a Perforce company. As such, the PRQA plugin (now called Helix-QAC Plugin) has changed cosmetically to reflect this. There may be a dedicated Helix-QAC plugin at a suitable GitHub location in the future. If one is created, it will be linked to from here.

# Introduction to Helix-QAC static analysis using the Helix QAC plugin

This plug-in enables the Helix-QAC static analysis tools to be integrated easily with Jenkins.

This plug-in is maintained by Perforce. It was originally developed and maintained by Praqma as far as release 1.2.2. Programming Research maintained it thereafter up to 3.2. Version 3.3.0 (this release) is maintained by Perforce. All service and feature requests should be sent directly to Perforce.

Prior to version 3.3.0 it supported Freestyle projects only, but now supports Pipeline projects. Prior to version 3.3.0 it supported Jenkins versions up to 2.107.2. This version (3.3.0) supports Jenkins version 2.164.3 onward.

Version 3.0.1 supported PRQA Framework version 2.2.0 onward and up to Jenkins version 2.107.2. Version 3.3.0 will support PRQA Framework version 2.2.0 onward and Helix-QAC Framework 2019.1 onward.

#### Pipeline support requires Jenkins version v2.164.3 or later.

# Summary Installation Instructions

* Install/use [latest stable](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) Jenkins version that is 2.164.3 or later
* Install the [Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/) plugin for Jenkins and restart Jenkins after installation
* Download and install this plug-in

Please download the [manual](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/qac-for-jenkins/Helix-QAC-Plug-in-for-Jenkins-Manual.pdf) for the Helix QAC Plugin for more detailed instructions.

# Features

This plug-in allows source code to be analyzed with Helix-QAC, Perforce's static analysis tools. The plug-in performs the following key tasks in the post-build stage, or as a pipeline step automatically:

* Analyzes a Helix-QAC project – optionally including dataflow and cross module analysis.
* Generates a compliance report
* Compares the total number of messages in the project against a configurable threshold and sets the build status to ‘unstable’ if the threshold is exceeded. This can be used as a gateway to preventing subsequent tasks from running.
* Optionally uploads the analysis results to Dashboard, the Helix-QAC web-based Quality Management System
* This plug-in is able to analyze configured Helix-QAC projects.
* HIS Metrics Report option has been added in this release.

The projects are configured using Helix QAC Framework. They can be configured using Helix-QAC tools to support the old analysis interface.

The plug-in allows the automation of the creation and analysis of Helix-QAC enabled projects. This enables the analysis to be performed as a part of a continuous integration strategy.

The plug-in displays a graphical history depicting the number of messages, and overall compliance levels in the project.

# Known Issues

* Compliance Summary on the Freestyle project summary page may display twice.
* The completion of a Pipeline build on the projects summary page will not refresh the entire page. The user should refresh the page on completion of the job run.
* Reports may be missing colours on pie charts and legend keys. This is due to Jenkins default security settings regarding JavaScript and CSS where both are disallowed. To remedy, please follow the instructions in the top answer to this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35783964/jenkins-html-publisher-plugin-no-css-is-displayed-when-report-is-viewed-in-j) question.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass in Script Security Plugin and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-1353
/
CVE-2019-1003040 (Script Security) and CVE-2019-1003041 (Pipeline: Groovy)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugins:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)
,

[`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in the Script Security and Pipeline: Groovy Plugins could be circumvented through methods supporting type casts and type coercion.
This allowed attackers to invoke constructors for arbitrary types.

Script Security and Pipeline: Groovy have been hardened to prevent these methods of bypassing sandbox protection.

### XSS vulnerability in Lockable Resources Plugin

**SECURITY-1361
/
CVE-2019-1003042**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`lockable-resources`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/lockable-resources)**

**Description:**

Lockable Resources Plugin did not properly escape resource names in generated JavaScript code, thus leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The plugin now properly escapes resource names in its scripts.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Slack Notification Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-976
/
CVE-2019-1003043 (missing permission check) and CVE-2019-1003044 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`slack`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack)**

**Description:**

Slack Notification Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for global configuration) or Item/Configure permissions (for job configuration).

### ECS Publisher Plugin stored and displayed API token in plain text

**SECURITY-846
/
CVE-2019-1003045**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ecs-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ecs-publisher)**

**Description:**

ECS Publisher Plugin stored the API token unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This token could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the API token was not masked from view using a password form field.

The plugin now stores the API token encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### SSRF vulnerability due to missing permission check in Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin

**SECURITY-992
/
CVE-2019-1003046 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-1003047 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in multiple form validation methods in Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.

Additionally, the form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The form validation methods now require POST requests and perform a permission check.

### PRQA Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1089
/
CVE-2019-1003048**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`prqa-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/prqa-plugin)**

**Description:**

PRQA Plugin stored a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk.

### Codebeamer Test Results Trend Updater Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1086**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`codebeamer-result-trend-updater`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/codebeamer-result-trend-updater)**

**Description:**

Codebeamer Test Results Trend Updater Plugin stored username and password in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now integrates with [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials).

### Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access were able to enumerate credential IDs in Arxan MAM Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-1328**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ease-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ease-plugin)**

**Description:**

Arxan MAM Publisher Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

## Severity
