Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WildFly Deployer Plugin stores deployment credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The plugin stores credentials in plain text instead of encrypting them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** Unauthorized users with access to the Jenkins master file system or users with "Extended Read" permissions can view the stored deployment credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** Attackers can gain access to the Jenkins master's file system to directly read the `config.xml` files.
- **Extended Read Permission:** Users with the "Extended Read" permission within Jenkins can also access the vulnerable configuration files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Jenkins master's file system:** Attackers need either direct access to the server's file system or "Extended Read" permissions in Jenkins.
