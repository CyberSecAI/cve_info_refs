Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003092:

**Vulnerability:** CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Nomad Plugin allow SSRF

**Root Cause:**
- A form validation method in the Nomad Plugin lacks a permission check.
- The form validation method doesn't require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Missing Permission Check:** Users with Overall/Read permissions can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL.
2.  **CSRF:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). By controlling the target URL, an attacker can potentially interact with internal services or external resources that are accessible to the Jenkins server. This could lead to information disclosure, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions depending on the target URL.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor can exploit this by crafting a link or a web page that, when visited by a logged-in Jenkins user with Overall/Read permission, sends a crafted request to the vulnerable form validation method, initiating a connection test to a URL controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in Jenkins user with Overall/Read permissions to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious page.
- The attacker needs to know the URL path to the vulnerable validation method.
- The attacker also needs to have a server/URL prepared for use in the SSRF attack.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is present in Nomad Plugin versions up to and including 0.4.
- The vulnerability is addressed by ensuring the form validation method requires POST requests and has a permission check.
