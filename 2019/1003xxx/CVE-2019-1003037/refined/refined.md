**CVE-2019-1003037**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Azure VM Agents Plugin did not check permissions when providing a list of applicable credential IDs.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing permission check.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs. This information could potentially be used in further attacks to capture credentials by exploiting another vulnerability.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can access the functionality to list credential IDs.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
