Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003019:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The GitHub Authentication Plugin did not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login. This allowed an attacker to potentially reuse a victim's pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

Session fixation vulnerability, where a user's session ID can be hijacked and reused after login by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a user's Jenkins account by reusing their session ID, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious actions performed under the victim's identity.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attacker needs to be able to control or obtain the user's pre-login session ID. This could potentially be done through various means such as network interception, local access to the victim's machine, or social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker needs to be able to obtain a user's pre-login session ID and then perform an action that causes a login to occur, while still possessing the original session ID. The attacker does not need specific permissions in Jenkins to do so. User interaction is required, as the victim needs to login using the vulnerable plugin while the attacker has a hold of the session id.
