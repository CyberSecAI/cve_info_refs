Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003066:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Bugzilla Plugin stores credentials, specifically the username and password for accessing the Bugzilla server, in an unencrypted format within the Jenkins controller's global configuration file (`hudson.plugins.bugzilla.BugzillaProjectProperty.xml`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials (username and password) in plaintext.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The lack of encryption makes it easy for unauthorized users to gain access to these credentials if they have access to the Jenkins master's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers who obtain the plaintext credentials can gain unauthorized access to the configured Bugzilla server and potentially view/modify bug reports.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins master's file system can directly read the global configuration file where the credentials are stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the file system of the Jenkins controller where the configuration files are stored.
- For lower severity configurations, a local attacker with access to the controller file system could read the credentials.
