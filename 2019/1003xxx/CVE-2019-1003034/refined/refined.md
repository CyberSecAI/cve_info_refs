{
  "cve": "CVE-2019-1003034",
  "description": "The Jenkins Job DSL Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions for Job DSL definitions. Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script. This allowed users able to control the Job DSL scripts to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.",
  "affected_versions": "Job DSL Plugin up to and including 1.71",
  "fixes": "Job DSL Plugin should be updated to version 1.72",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Job DSL Plugin's sandbox protection could be bypassed during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation of Groovy scripts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of Groovy scripts within the sandbox.",
      "Lack of proper security checks during script processing phases."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins master, leading to potential compromise of data confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.",
     "attack_vector": "By providing a crafted Groovy script to the Job DSL plugin.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have control over the Job DSL scripts."
