# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1690663#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-03-20 00:54:34 UTC  ``` The Jenkins Job DSL Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions for Job DSL definitions. Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.  This allowed users able to control the Job DSL scripts to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.  Job DSL Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.   External Reference:  <https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-03-06/#SECURITY-1342>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1690663#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-10 18:34:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:0739 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0739](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0739)   ``` |  |

[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

Script Security Plugin is now newly applying sandbox protection during these phases.

This affected both script execution (typically invoked from other plugins) as well as an HTTP endpoint providing script validation and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

The API `GroovySandbox#run(Script, Whitelist)` has been deprecated and now emits a warning to the system log about potential security problems.
`GroovySandbox#run(GroovyShell, String, Whitelist)` replaces it.
`GroovySandbox#checkScriptForCompilationErrors(String, GroovyClassLoader)` has been added as a safer method to implement script validation.

### Missing permission check in Azure VM Agents Plugin allowed modifying VM configuration

**SECURITY-1331
/
CVE-2019-1003036**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-vm-agents`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-vm-agents)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint allowed users with Overall/Read access to attach a public IP address to an Azure VM in Azure VM Agents Plugin, making a virtual machine publicly accessible.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability with more limited impact, as the IP address would not be known.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Azure VM Agents Plugin

**SECURITY-1332
/
CVE-2019-1003037**

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-vm-agents`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-vm-agents)**

**Description:**

Azure VM Agents Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### Repository Connector Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-958
/
CVE-2019-1003038**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`repository-connector`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/repository-connector)**

**Description:**

Repository Connector Plugin stored the username and password in its configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

**Affected plugin:
[`appdynamics-dashboard`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/appdynamics-dashboard)**

**Description:**

AppDynamics Dashboard Plugin stored username and password in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

While masked from view using a password form field, the password was transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form.

AppDynamics Dashboard Plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.
Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.

### Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-848**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`rabbitmq-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rabbitmq-publisher)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in a form validation method of Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins initiate a RabbitMQ connection to an attacker-specified host and port with an attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### OSF Builder Suite For Salesforce Commerce Cloud :: Deploy Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1038**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`osf-builder-suite-for-sfcc-deploy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/osf-builder-suite-for-sfcc-deploy)**

**Description:**

OSF Builder Suite For Salesforce Commerce Cloud : : Deploy Plugin stored the HTTP proxy username and password in its configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now integrates with [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials) to store the HTTP proxy credentials.

### SSRF and data modification vulnerability due to missing permission check in Bitbar Run-in-Cloud

**SECURITY-1088**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

# Job DSL

How to install**This plugin is up for adoption!** We are looking for new maintainers. Visit our [Adopt a Plugin](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/) initiative for more information.

* [Dependencies](/job-dsl/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/job-dsl/healthscore/)

**NOTE** The Job DSL Plugin is [currently seeking co-maintainers](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/WtNZKVWVlJ0/m/Zbd7SH_GFAAJ). This does **not** mean that it's unmaintained right now, but that stepping up to help support this plugin would help long-term health of this project.

## Introduction

Jenkins is a wonderful system for managing builds, and people love using its UI to configure jobs. Unfortunately, as the number of jobs grows, maintaining them becomes tedious, and the paradigm of using a UI falls apart. Additionally, the common pattern in this situation is to copy jobs to create new ones, these "children" have a habit of diverging from their original "template" and consequently it becomes difficult to maintain consistency between these jobs.

The Job DSL plugin attempts to solve this problem by allowing jobs to be defined in a programmatic form in a human-readable file. Writing such a file is feasible without being a Jenkins expert as the configuration from the web UI translates intuitively into code.

[![configuration form](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin@master/docs/images/pipeline.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/pipeline.png)

The job configuration above can be generated from the following code.

```
pipelineJob('job-dsl-plugin') {
  definition {
    cpsScm {
      scm {
        git {
          remote {
            url('https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin.git')
          }
          branch('*/master')
        }
      }
      lightweight()
    }
  }
}

```

Job DSL was one of the first popular plugins for Jenkins which allows managing configuration as code and many other plugins dealing with this aspect have been created since then, most notably the [Jenkins Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) and [Configuration as Code](https://jenkins.io/projects/jcasc/) plugins. It is important to understand the differences between these plugins and Job DSL for managing Jenkins configuration efficiently.

The Pipeline plugins support implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines via the Pipeline DSL. While it is possible to use Job DSL to create complex pipelines using freestyle jobs in combination with many plugins from the Jenkins ecosystem, creating and maintaining these pipeline, including generating jobs for individual SCM branches and possibly running steps in parallel to improve build performance, poses a significant challenge. Jenkins Pipeline is often the better choice for creating complex automated processes. Job DSL can be used to create Pipeline and Multibranch Pipeline jobs. Do not confuse Job DSL with Pipeline DSL, both have their own syntax and scope of application.

The Configuration as Code plugin can be used to manage the global system configuration of Jenkins. It comes with an integration for Job DSL to create an initial set of jobs.

## Getting Started

First, start a Jenkins instance with the Job DSL plugin installed.

Then create a freestyle project named "seed".

[![configuration form](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin@master/docs/images/create-seed-job.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/create-seed-job.png)

Add a "Process Job DSLs" build step and paste the script below into the "DSL Script" field.

```
job('example') {
  steps {
    shell('echo Hello World!')
  }
}

```

When running Jenkins on Windows, replace the `shell` step by a `batchFile` step.

```
job('example') {
  steps {
    batchFile('echo Hello World!')
  }
}

```

[![configuration form](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin@master/docs/images/build-step.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/build-step.png)

Save the configuration, start a build and inspect the console output.

```
Started by user admin
Running as SYSTEM
Building in workspace /var/jenkins_home/workspace/seed
Processing provided DSL script
Added items:
    GeneratedJob{name='example'}
Finished: SUCCESS

```

The seed job has generated the "example" job. Verify the result on the job's configuration page.

[![generated job](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin@master/docs/images/result.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/result.png)

Instead of creating a seed job manually, consider using the [Configuration as Code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code) plugin. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/JCasC) for details.

## Documentation

The complete DSL API reference is available in your Jenkins installation at `https://your.jenkins.installation/plugin/job-dsl/api-viewer/index.html`. You can find links to the API reference on the seed job page and the Job DSL build step.

A limited sub-set of the API reference is available online at <https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/>. But be aware that this does not show all API that is available in your Jenkins installation because a lot of the documentation is generated at runtime by introspecting the plugins that have been installed.

Jenkins saves the configuration of each job in a XML file. The Job DSL plugin is in principle a generator for these XML files, translating the DSL code into XML. If a configuration option is not available in the high-level DSL, it is possible to generate the XML directly using a [Configure Block](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/The-Configure-Block).

Find the complete documentation on the [Wiki](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1690665#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-03-20 01:02:31 UTC  ``` The Jenkins Pipeline: Groovy sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.  This allowed users able to control the contents of a pipeline to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.  Pipeline: Groovy Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.    External Reference:  <https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-03-06/#SECURITY-1336%20(2>)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1690665#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-10 18:34:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:0739 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0739](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0739)   ``` |  |
