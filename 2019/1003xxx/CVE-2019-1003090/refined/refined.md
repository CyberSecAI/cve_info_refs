The provided content contains vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1003090.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing permission check in a form validation method within the SOASTA CloudTest Plugin. Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing permission check: The form validation method lacks a check to ensure the user has the necessary permissions to initiate a connection test.
- CSRF vulnerability: The form validation method does not require POST requests, which makes it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a user with Overall/Read permissions to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL. The attacker can also provide attacker-specified credentials and SSH key store options, potentially leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This could enable the attacker to access internal resources, gather sensitive information, or potentially cause denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user with Overall/Read permissions can send a request to initiate a connection test using a crafted URL.
- The lack of POST request requirement allows an attacker to trigger the connection test through a CSRF attack by tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request or CSRF attack to exploit the vulnerability.
