Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk Publisher Plugin stores credentials in plain text within its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The plugin stores sensitive information (credentials) unencrypted. This makes the credentials vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Disclosure:** Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the unencrypted credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** With the exposed credentials, attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** An attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system to directly read the configuration files containing the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved via compromised user accounts, system vulnerabilities, or insider threats.
*   No specific user privileges within Jenkins are explicitly required, only access to the file system itself.
