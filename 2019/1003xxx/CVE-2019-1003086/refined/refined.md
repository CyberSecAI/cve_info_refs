Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `sinatra-chef-builder` plugin has a missing permission check in a form validation method. This allows users with Overall/Read permissions to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.
- The form validation method does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin doesn't properly verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the connection test.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of POST request requirement allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that can be triggered by a logged-in user without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can initiate a connection to an arbitrary server, potentially leading to:
  - **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** If the attacker specifies an internal server or service, it can be accessed and potentially abused
  - Disclosure of internal information
  - Potential for further attacks on the targeted infrastructure
  - Exposure of attacker-specified credentials if provided in the connection test

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker exploits the lack of permission check to initiate a connection test to a server of their choice using a crafted URL.
- The attacker can leverage CSRF by sending a malicious link/form to a logged-in Jenkins user. When the victim triggers the request, the attack is performed on their behalf.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission in the Jenkins instance.
- They also need a way to induce a logged in victim user into triggering their crafted request, either via a malicious link or other methods of CSRF execution.
