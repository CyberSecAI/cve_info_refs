Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003054:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Jira Issue Updater Plugin stores credentials in plain text within job configuration files (`config.xml`). This occurs because the plugin does not encrypt sensitive data before storing it in configuration files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** Credentials for Jira access are stored in an unencrypted format within job configuration files on the Jenkins controller.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Users with "Extended Read" permission on Jenkins jobs, or those with access to the Jenkins controller's file system, can view the stored credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers with the necessary access can obtain Jira credentials. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the Jira system, manipulation of issues, or data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Jenkins Controller File System:** An attacker who gains access to the underlying server running the Jenkins controller can directly read the configuration files to extract the credentials.
- **"Extended Read" Permission:** A user with "Extended Read" permission on a Jenkins job can access the job's configuration files, where the credentials are stored in plaintext.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege User:** An attacker can exploit this if they have at least "Extended Read" access to Jenkins jobs. This does not require administrative privileges on the Jenkins instance
- **File System Access:** An attacker can also exploit this with access to the file system where the Jenkins controller stores data.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability is one of many similar vulnerabilities found across different Jenkins plugins. The common theme is the failure to encrypt credentials stored within configuration files.
- The vulnerability has a medium severity score, which likely results from the combination of the vulnerability's impact on confidentiality and the need for some level of access (either extended read or file system) for successful exploitation.
