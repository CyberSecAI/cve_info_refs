The provided content includes information about multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins, including the one specified in the CVE ID (CVE-2019-1003087).

Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-1003087:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A missing permission check in a form validation method.
*   The form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing permission check:** Users with Overall/Read permission can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, allowing for cross-site request forgery.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can cause the Jenkins server to initiate a connection to an attacker-controlled server.
*   This can be used to conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to craft a malicious request to trigger the vulnerable form validation method.
*   The attacker would need to convince a user with Overall/Read permissions to trigger the malicious request (CSRF).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have access to the Jenkins instance and be able to send requests to the Jenkins server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user with Overall/Read permissions into triggering the attack.

**Specific plugin:**

*   `sinatra-chef-builder` plugin.
