The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins.  Specifically, it includes details for CVE-2019-1003084 (CSRF) and **CVE-2019-1003085** (permission check), which is relevant to the request.

**CVE-2019-1003085:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A missing permission check in a form validation method within the Zephyr Enterprise Test Management Plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Missing permission check: The form validation method lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to trigger actions.
    *   CSRF: The form validation method doesn't require POST requests, allowing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to initiate connection tests to an attacker-specified server, potentially enabling Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   A user with Overall/Read permission can initiate a connection test to an arbitrary server.
    *   The lack of POST request validation allows CSRF attacks.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.
