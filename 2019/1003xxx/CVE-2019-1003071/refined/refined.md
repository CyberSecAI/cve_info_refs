Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Octopus Deploy Plugin stores credentials in plain text within its global configuration file (`hudson.plugins.octopusdeploy.OctopusDeployPlugin.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is storing sensitive credentials, such as API keys or passwords, without any encryption. This makes them easily readable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:**  If an attacker gains access to the Jenkins controller's file system, they can easily read the stored credentials and use them to access the Octopus Deploy service, potentially leading to unauthorized deployment activities.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of the credentials leads to a breach of confidentiality, as sensitive access information is no longer protected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining unauthorized access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be through compromised accounts, misconfigured access controls, or other system-level vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This usually requires some level of system access, either through a compromised user account or direct access to the server itself.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities found in various Jenkins plugins, all related to storing credentials in plain text. The document describes many other plugins that had similar issues.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity by Jenkins.
*   The affected versions of the Octopus Deploy plugin are up to and including version 1.9.0.
*   No fix was available for this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
