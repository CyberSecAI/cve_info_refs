# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1690663#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-03-20 00:54:34 UTC  ``` The Jenkins Job DSL Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions for Job DSL definitions. Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.  This allowed users able to control the Job DSL scripts to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.  Job DSL Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.   External Reference:  <https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-03-06/#SECURITY-1342>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1690663#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-10 18:34:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:0739 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0739](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0739)   ``` |  |

# Matrix Project

How to install

* [Documentation](/matrix-project/)
* [Releases](/matrix-project/releases/)
* [Issues](/matrix-project/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/matrix-project/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/matrix-project/healthscore/)

In the New Item user interface, this plugin contributes the following one: [![Muti-configuration Project](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/matrix-project-plugin@master/doc/images/multi-configuration-project.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/matrix-project-plugin/blob/master/doc/images/multi-configuration-project.png)

## Multi-Configuration Projects

A multi-configuration project is useful for instances where your builds will make many similar build steps, and you would otherwise be duplicating steps.

## Configuration matrix

The Configuration Matrix allows you to specify what steps to duplicate, and create a multiple-axis graph of the type of builds to create.

For example, let us say that we have a build that we want to create for several different targets alpha, beta, and we want to produce both debug and release outputs. With a freestyle job, we would have the following ant commands:

```
Ant: set-target-alpha debug compile
Ant: set-target-beta debug compile
Ant: set-target-gamma debug compile
Ant: set-target-alpha release compile
Ant: set-target-beta release compile
Ant: set-target-gamma release compile

```

We can reduce this to one ant target using variables:

```
Ant: $target $releasetype compile

```

And by adding two User Defined Axis in the Configuration Matrix:

Name: `target` Value: `set-target-alpha set-target-beta set-target-gamma`

Name: `releasetype` Value: `debug release`

The Names target and releasetype are exposed to the ant scripts as environment variables. The Value is a space delimited list of points to iterate through for each axis.

The immediate upshot is that if we have another release type to add (for example, debug-optimized), we can simply add the value to the releasetype user defined axis. The single change will add configuration to build the debug-optimized release type against all three values of target.

## Notes

* You have to choose "Build multi-configuration project" when creating a project, it can not be changed later. If you skip this step, you will be very confused and not get very far.
* Each configuration is akin to an individual job. It has its own build history, logs, environment, etc. The history of your multi-config job only shows you a list of configurations executed. You have to drill into each configuration to see the history and console logs.

## Executors used by a multi-configuration project

Reference: [Re: Will a multi-configuration / matrix job always use up one executor on the built-in node?](http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-users/msg/eb809fb06759d861)

A matrix build project (that uses the Agent axis) will use one additional executor on a random node to coordinate the executions on the nodes defined by the Agent axis. This executor is added as a temporary executor (also called as "flyweight task") to the node and does not use up a configured executor slot on this node (this behavior is controlled by hudson.model.Hudson.flyweightSupport). Only this "flyweight task" will be affected by the "Restrict where this project can be run" option, under Advanced Project Options. "Actual" or non-flyweight build execution can be controlled with the "Agents" axis that can be added under the project's Configuration Matrix: individual nodes and/or labels containing multiple nodes can be selected, as well as filtering axis combinations.

You can also control which nodes can run flyweight tasks, using the [Exclude flyweight tasks plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/excludeMatrixParent), or you can pin the flyweight executor to a specific node (Please look under the "advanced" option of the matrix project configuration to tie the matrix parent to a label/agent).

## Extensions

Please refer to the [list of extensions points](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/extensions/matrix-project/) of this plugin.

## Matrix Axis Extensions

### [Dynamic Axis Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dynamic-axis)

This plugin allows you to define a matrix build axis that is dynamically populated from an environment variable:

### [Selenium Axis Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/selenium-axis)

Creates an axis based on a local Selenium grid and also build against the SauceLabs Selenium capability at the same time. Both components rebuild before each build to take advantage of any new capabilities.

The Selenium grid uses all capabilities available and the SauceLab one a random subset, which can be configured or disabled.

### [Yaml Axis Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/yaml-axis)

Matrix project axis creation and exclusion plugin using yaml file (It's similar to .travis.yml)

### [Sauce OnDemand Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sauce-ondemand)

This plugin allows you to integrate Sauce Selenium Testing with Jenkins.

### [Matrix Groovy Execution Strategy Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-groovy-execution-strategy)

A plugin to decide the execution order and valid combinations of matrix projects.

### [Elastic Axis](https://plugins.jenkins.io/elastic-axis)

This plugin is a power up for the multi configuration jobs allowing you to configure jobs to run on all agents under a single label.

### [NodeLabel Parameter Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nodelabelparameter)

This plugin adds two new parameter types to job configuration - node and label, this allows to dynamically select the node where a job/project should be executed.

If your plug-in is not listed here, please file a PR for the README file.

[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

Script Security Plugin is now newly applying sandbox protection during these phases.

This affected both script execution (typically invoked from other plugins) as well as an HTTP endpoint providing script validation and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

The API `GroovySandbox#run(Script, Whitelist)` has been deprecated and now emits a warning to the system log about potential security problems.
`GroovySandbox#run(GroovyShell, String, Whitelist)` replaces it.
`GroovySandbox#checkScriptForCompilationErrors(String, GroovyClassLoader)` has been added as a safer method to implement script validation.

/
CVE-2019-1003033**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`groovy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/groovy)**

**Description:**

Groovy Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions for its "System Groovy" functionality.
Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

This affected both System Groovy script execution as well as an HTTP endpoint providing script validation, and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

Groovy Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.

### Script security sandbox bypass in Job DSL Plugin

**SECURITY-1342
/
CVE-2019-1003034**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-dsl`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl)**

**Description:**

Job DSL Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions for Job DSL definitions.
Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

This allowed users able to control the Job DSL scripts to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

Job DSL Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.

### Information disclosure in Azure VM Agents Plugin

**SECURITY-1330
/
CVE-2019-1003035**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-vm-agents`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-vm-agents)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in a form validation method in Azure VM Agents Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to verify a submitted configuration, obtaining limited information about the Azure account and configuration.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a potential CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### Missing permission check in Azure VM Agents Plugin allowed modifying VM configuration

**SECURITY-1331
/
CVE-2019-1003036**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-vm-agents`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-vm-agents)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint allowed users with Overall/Read access to attach a public IP address to an Azure VM in Azure VM Agents Plugin, making a virtual machine publicly accessible.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability with more limited impact, as the IP address would not be known.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Azure VM Agents Plugin

**SECURITY-1332
/
CVE-2019-1003037**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-vm-agents`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-vm-agents)**

**Description:**

Azure VM Agents Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### Repository Connector Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-958
/
CVE-2019-1003038**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`repository-connector`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/repository-connector)**

**Description:**

Repository Connector Plugin stored the username and password in its configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### AppDynamics Dashboard Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1087
/
CVE-2019-1003039**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`appdynamics-dashboard`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/appdynamics-dashboard)**

**Description:**

AppDynamics Dashboard Plugin stored username and password in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

While masked from view using a password form field, the password was transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form.

AppDynamics Dashboard Plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.
Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.

### Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-848**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`rabbitmq-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rabbitmq-publisher)**

**Description:**

Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin stored the username and password in its configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### Missing permission check allowed connecting to RabbitMQ in Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-970**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`rabbitmq-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rabbitmq-publisher)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in a form validation method of Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins initiate a RabbitMQ connection to an attacker-specified host and port with an attacker-specified username and password.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### OSF Builder Suite For Salesforce Commerce Cloud :: Deploy Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1038**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`osf-builder-suite-for-sfcc-deploy`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/osf-builder-suite-for-sfcc-deploy)**

**Description:**

OSF Builder Suite For Salesforce Commerce Cloud : : Deploy Plugin stored the HTTP proxy username and password in its configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now integrates with [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials) to store the HTTP proxy credentials.

### SSRF and data modification vulnerability due to missing permission check in Bitbar Run-in-Cloud

**SECURITY-1088**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`testdroid-run-in-cloud`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/testdroid-run-in-cloud)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in a method performing both form validation and saving new configuration in Bitbar Run-in-Cloud Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins connect to an attacker-specified host with attacker-specified credentials, and, if successful, save that as the new configuration for the plugin. This could then potentially result in future builds submitting their data to an unauthorized remote server.

Additionally, this method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.
