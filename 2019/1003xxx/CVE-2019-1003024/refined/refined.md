Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Jenkins Script Security Plugin's sandbox implementation. The plugin failed to properly restrict the use of certain Groovy language features. Specifically, it did not prevent the use of `AnnotationCollector`, import aliasing, and referencing annotation types using their full class names. These Groovy features allowed bypassing the intended security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incomplete Sandbox Protection:** The primary vulnerability is an incomplete sandbox implementation in the Script Security plugin, which is intended to restrict the capabilities of user-provided scripts.
- **Unsafe AST Transformations:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to use unsafe AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transforming annotations. Specifically, the use of `@Grab` was previously addressed, but the fix could be bypassed by using the above mentioned Groovy features

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller's JVM.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance, impacting data confidentiality, integrity, and system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious code through Jenkinsfiles, sandboxed Pipeline shared libraries, or any other mechanism that allows execution of Groovy scripts.
- **Control of SCM Contents:** Attackers can gain control over the content of scripts stored in a source code management (SCM) system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Overall/Read Permission:** An attacker must have at least Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.
- **Control over Script Content:** Attackers must be able to control the contents of Groovy scripts that are executed within the Jenkins environment. This could be through access to Jenkinsfiles, Pipeline shared libraries, or similar mechanisms.
- **Knowledge of Groovy Language:** The attacker must have an understanding of Groovy and how to leverage the aforementioned features to bypass the sandbox.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.53 of the Script Security plugin.
- The fix includes prohibiting the use of `AnnotationCollector` in sandboxed scripts, disallowing the import of unsafe annotations, and rejecting both simple and full class names of prohibited annotations during the compilation phase.
- Red Hat also addressed this vulnerability in OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.
