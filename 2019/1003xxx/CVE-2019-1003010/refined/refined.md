Based on the provided data, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-1003010:

**CVE-2019-1003010**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Git plugin's HTTP endpoint for creating tags in a job workspace did not require POST requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially trick a user into creating a tag in a job's workspace Git repository with attacker-specified metadata. While this seems like a low impact vulnerability, it could be a stepping stone for further attacks.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker would need to have a user with permissions in Jenkins click the malicious link. The attacker does not need credentials on the Jenkins server, but needs to entice a user to perform an action.
