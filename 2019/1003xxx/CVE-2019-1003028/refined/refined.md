Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check within a form validation method of the JMS Messaging Plugin. This lack of proper access control allows unauthorized users to initiate a connection test to an arbitrary URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows initiating HTTP requests to an attacker-specified URL, enabling a potential SSRF attack.
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The form validation method lacks a check to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the action.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with Overall/Read permissions could exploit the SSRF vulnerability, by sending requests to an attacker-specified URL. This could be used to probe internal network resources, potentially retrieve sensitive information, or cause other unintended actions on the target system or other internal systems accessible from the Jenkins server. The impact of the SSRF is that the attacker could send an HTTP request, they could not read the response to that request.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through the vulnerable form validation method in the plugin, which is accessible to any user with Overall/Read access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs Overall/Read permissions within the Jenkins instance. This could be a user with a valid Jenkins account or potentially an unauthenticated user if the Jenkins instance allows anonymous read access.
*   The attacker can specify the URL that will be used in the HTTP request.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating the plugin to version 1.1.2 or later.
*   The fix implemented requires POST requests for the form validation method and performs a permission check.
