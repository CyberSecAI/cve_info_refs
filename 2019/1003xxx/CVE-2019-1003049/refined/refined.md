- Root cause of vulnerability: The fix for SECURITY-901 in Jenkins 2.150.2 and 2.160 did not reject existing remoting-based CLI authentication caches.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Jenkins accepted cached legacy CLI authentication.
- Impact of exploitation: Users who cached their CLI authentication before Jenkins was updated would remain authenticated.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability could be exploited if a user had cached their CLI authentication before updating Jenkins.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to have access to a user's cached CLI authentication from before the Jenkins update. A high level of privileges is required to exploit this.
