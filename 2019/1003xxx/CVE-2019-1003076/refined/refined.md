Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `Audit to Database` plugin's form validation method lacks a permission check. This allows any user with Overall/Read permission to initiate a JDBC database connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-controlled credentials.
*   The form validation method does not enforce POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin fails to verify if the user has sufficient privileges to perform the connection test, allowing unauthorized users with only Overall/Read permissions to trigger the functionality.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The absence of POST request enforcement makes the plugin susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery, where an attacker could trick a victim's browser into sending a malicious request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Database Connection:** An attacker can force the Jenkins server to initiate a connection to a database controlled by the attacker.
*   **Information Disclosure (Potential):**  If the attacker's database server is configured to log incoming connections, they might gather information about the Jenkins server.
*   **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  While not explicitly stated, the ability to connect to arbitrary database servers indicates an SSRF vulnerability, allowing the attacker to potentially interact with internal services the Jenkins server has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can exploit this via a crafted URL (due to missing POST request enforcement).
*   The attack vector would be a user with Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoints of the plugin.
*   The attacker would need to have a malicious database server that is accessible by the Jenkins server.
