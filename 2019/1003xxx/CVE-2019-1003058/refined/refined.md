Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The FTP publisher plugin's form validation method lacks a permission check, and does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The form validation method in the FTP publisher plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the connection test.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, which makes it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit the missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability to initiate a connection test to an arbitrary FTP server, using attacker-specified credentials. This could lead to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:** By controlling the FTP server, an attacker could potentially capture credentials or other sensitive information sent to the server.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could potentially use this to overload or disrupt the target FTP server.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** In some scenarios, if the target FTP server is within the internal network, this could serve as a pivot point for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network via the Jenkins web interface.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious link or web page to trigger the connection test.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to interact with a malicious link or web page (CSRF attack).

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability is addressed in conjunction with CVE-2019-1003059, which is also about the missing permission check.
