Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003043:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Slack Notification Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method that implements form validation. This allowed unauthorized users to perform actions they should not have been able to perform, specifically connecting to an attacker-specified URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of permission checks on a form validation method. This allowed users with `Overall/Read` access to exploit the functionality.
*   **Credentials Capture:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs. This effectively allowed them to capture credentials stored within Jenkins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credentials Theft:** Attackers could steal sensitive credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Users with read-only access could trigger actions they should not be able to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is network based, performed by sending requests to the Jenkins server.
*   The specific attack vector was through the form validation method, which lacked proper access controls.
*   An attacker must obtain a valid credential ID via other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Jenkins User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Jenkins server.
*   **Overall/Read Access:** The attacker only needs Overall/Read access permissions in Jenkins to exploit this vulnerability, this indicates a lack of proper access control in the vulnerable method.
*   **Credential ID knowledge:**  The attacker must know the ID of a valid credential stored within Jenkins.

**Additional Information:**
*   This vulnerability is related to another vulnerability, CVE-2019-1003044, which was caused by a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability due to the form validation method not requiring POST requests.
*   The fix for the vulnerability involved requiring POST requests for the form validation method and implementing permission checks.
