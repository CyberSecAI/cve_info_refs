Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003045:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ECS Publisher Plugin stored the API token in plain text within the job's `config.xml` files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins master.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unencrypted storage of sensitive information (API token)
- Lack of masking the API token when displayed in the configuration form

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of the API token to users with Extended Read permissions within Jenkins.
- Exposure of the API token to anyone with access to the Jenkins master file system.
- The exposed API token could be used to perform actions on behalf of the legitimate user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Users with Extended Read permissions can view the unencrypted API token through the Jenkins UI.
- Attackers with access to the Jenkins master's file system can read the `config.xml` files or global configuration file to obtain the API token.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have either Extended Read permissions within Jenkins or access to the Jenkins master's file system.
