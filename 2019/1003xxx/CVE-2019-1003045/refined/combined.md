tab(**/pluginManager/available**).

Then find plugin by name "ecs-publisher", toggle checkbox and click
install.

**2) install from source**

Run the following commands:

```
# Clone source code
git clone git@github.com:jenkinsci/ecs-publisher-plugin
# Generate *.hpi package
mvn package
# package will be located at target/ecspublisher.hpi

```

Then go to plugin manager page on jenkins and click on "advanced"
tab(**/pluginManager/advanced**).

Then find upload plugin block and choose \*.hpi package and click
upload.

## Usage

* First you need to setup global configuration for this plugin.

  **You can skip that step** if you want to save configuration under
  step definition.

  Go to "Manage Jenkins" and click "Configure System"
  configure(/configure).

  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/ecs-publisher-plugin/master/doc/img/jenkins-global-config.png){width="500"}

  Then find block called "TrueSource publisher", change configuration
  and click "save"
* Secondly you need go to project configuration

  + Add post-build action called "ecspublisher"
  + Type project name
  + ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/ecs-publisher-plugin/master/doc/img/jenkins-post-build-action-closed.png){width="500"}
  + If your project has different structure you can specify paths to
    plugins
  + **You can override global configuration** just toggle checkboxes
  + ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/ecs-publisher-plugin/master/doc/img/jenkins-post-build-action-open.png){width="500"}
  + Click "save"

After you add post-build action it will automatically create two pages
ECS analysis for build and project.

## Development

This plugin can be built and started with maven and Jenkins hpi
plugin:

Just run command:

```
./run

```

Jenkins will be available on port
[8089](<http://localhost:8089/jenkins>)

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass in Script Security Plugin and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-1353
/
CVE-2019-1003040 (Script Security) and CVE-2019-1003041 (Pipeline: Groovy)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugins:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)
,

[`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in the Script Security and Pipeline: Groovy Plugins could be circumvented through methods supporting type casts and type coercion.
This allowed attackers to invoke constructors for arbitrary types.

Script Security and Pipeline: Groovy have been hardened to prevent these methods of bypassing sandbox protection.

### XSS vulnerability in Lockable Resources Plugin

**SECURITY-1361
/
CVE-2019-1003042**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`lockable-resources`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/lockable-resources)**

**Description:**

Lockable Resources Plugin did not properly escape resource names in generated JavaScript code, thus leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

The plugin now properly escapes resource names in its scripts.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Slack Notification Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-976
/
CVE-2019-1003043 (missing permission check) and CVE-2019-1003044 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`slack`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/slack)**

**Description:**

Slack Notification Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for global configuration) or Item/Configure permissions (for job configuration).

### ECS Publisher Plugin stored and displayed API token in plain text

**SECURITY-846
/
CVE-2019-1003045**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ecs-publisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ecs-publisher)**

**Description:**

ECS Publisher Plugin stored the API token unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This token could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, the API token was not masked from view using a password form field.

The plugin now stores the API token encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.

### SSRF vulnerability due to missing permission check in Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin

**SECURITY-992
/
CVE-2019-1003046 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-1003047 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`fortify-on-demand-uploader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fortify-on-demand-uploader)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in multiple form validation methods in Fortify on Demand Uploader Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.

Additionally, the form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The form validation methods now require POST requests and perform a permission check.

### PRQA Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1089
/
CVE-2019-1003048**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`prqa-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/prqa-plugin)**

**Description:**

PRQA Plugin stored a password unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk.

### Codebeamer Test Results Trend Updater Plugin stored password in plain text

**SECURITY-1086**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`codebeamer-result-trend-updater`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/codebeamer-result-trend-updater)**

**Description:**

Codebeamer Test Results Trend Updater Plugin stored username and password in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

The plugin now integrates with [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials).

### Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access were able to enumerate credential IDs in Arxan MAM Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-1328**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ease-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ease-plugin)**

**Description:**

Arxan MAM Publisher Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

## Severity
