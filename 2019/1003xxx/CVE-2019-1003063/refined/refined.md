Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003063:

**CVE-2019-1003063:**

*   **Vulnerability:** The Amazon SNS Build Notifier Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin saves sensitive information (credentials) in plain text within the `org.jenkinsci.plugins.snsnotify.AmazonSNSNotifier.xml` file.
*  **Weaknesses:**  Storing credentials in plain text is a significant vulnerability. The lack of encryption makes it easy for attackers to access this sensitive data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Users with access to the Jenkins master file system can view the unencrypted credentials.
    *   An attacker could use these credentials to access and manipulate the associated AWS SNS topic, which can be used to send notifications.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs to gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the configuration file where the credentials are stored.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have some level of access to the server hosting the Jenkins master to gain read access to the relevant file. This could involve compromising the server, or using existing credentials with access to the filesystem.
*   **Affected Plugin:** Amazon SNS Build Notifier Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** Up to and including version 1.13
*   **Fix:** No fix is listed in the advisory, it's stated that no fix is available as of the advisory publication.
