The provided content relates to CVE-2019-1003080.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing permission check in a form validation method in the OpenShift Deployer Plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: The form validation method does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the connection test.
- CSRF vulnerability: The form validation method does not require POST requests, allowing an attacker to trigger the connection test via a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials. This could allow for a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, where the Jenkins server makes requests to arbitrary servers controlled by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the missing permission check and CSRF vulnerability by crafting a malicious request that triggers the connection test to a server under their control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a victim user into submitting a crafted request, typically by embedding it into a malicious web page or email.
