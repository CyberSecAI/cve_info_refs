Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003077:

**CVE-2019-1003077**

* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    * The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in a form validation method within the Audit to Database Plugin. This allows users with the `Overall/Read` permission to initiate a JDBC database connection test to an attacker-specified server, using attacker-supplied credentials.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    * **Missing Permission Check:** The form validation method lacks proper authorization checks, enabling unauthorized users to trigger connection tests.
    * **CSRF vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * An attacker could potentially connect to an arbitrary database server, which can lead to several issues like:
        * **Data Exposure**:  If the attacker gains access to the database they could potentially read the data in the database.
        * **Data Manipulation**:  The attacker may be able to modify or delete data from the database.
        * **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker could cause a DoS by connecting to an unresponding server.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint of the Audit to Database Plugin. The request would specify an attacker-controlled database server and credentials, and the missing permission check would allow the connection to be initiated, potentially leading to a server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    * Because the form validation method does not require a POST request a CSRF attack can be easily carried out.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker requires a Jenkins user account with at least the `Overall/Read` permission.
    * The attacker also needs knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and its API.

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability is part of a larger set of security issues affecting multiple Jenkins plugins.
* The advisory also mentions a CSRF vulnerability associated with this issue.
* A fix for this vulnerability was not yet available at the time of the advisory, but should be addressed in a future update to the plugin.
