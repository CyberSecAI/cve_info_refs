Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003093:

**CVE-2019-1003093**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing permission check in a form validation method within the Nomad plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** Users with Overall/Read permissions can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL.
    *   **CSRF vulnerability:** The form validation method doesn't require POST requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), potentially accessing internal resources or services.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker crafts a request to the vulnerable form validation endpoint, specifying a malicious URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires a Jenkins user account with at least "Overall/Read" permissions.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-1003093 is related to a missing permission check in the Nomad plugin of Jenkins that, combined with a lack of CSRF protection, allows attackers with "Overall/Read" permissions to initiate connection tests to arbitrary URLs, potentially resulting in SSRF attacks.
