Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-1003020:

**CVE-2019-1003020**

*   **Root Cause:** The Kanboard Plugin did not properly check user permissions and did not require POST requests for a form validation method.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin failed to verify if a user had the necessary permissions to access the form validation method.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method used a GET request, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to make the Jenkins server send a GET request to an attacker-specified URL, effectively performing a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker could craft a malicious link or webpage that, when accessed by a logged-in Jenkins user, would trigger the vulnerable form validation method.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in Jenkins user with Overall/Read access to click a malicious link.
    *   No other specific system access is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary**

The Kanboard Plugin had a vulnerability where a form validation method could be triggered by a user with Overall/Read permissions through a GET request. This allowed a malicious actor to perform a server-side request forgery by crafting a URL that forces the server to make a request to another location. This vulnerability was addressed by requiring POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions for the form validation method.
