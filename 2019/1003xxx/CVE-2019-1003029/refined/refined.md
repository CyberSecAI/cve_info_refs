  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Script Security plugin in Jenkins did not properly apply sandbox protections during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation of Groovy scripts. A crafted Groovy script could bypass the sandbox protection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Sandbox Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with Overall/Read permissions could bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master JVM, leading to complete system compromise, including data confidentiality and integrity and system availability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing a crafted Groovy script via HTTP endpoint.",
       "By providing a crafted Groovy script when it is executed as part of a Jenkins job."
