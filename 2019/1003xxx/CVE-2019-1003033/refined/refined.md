Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Groovy plugin's "System Groovy" functionality, which allows execution of Groovy scripts within the Jenkins master's JVM, had a flaw in its sandbox implementation. The sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a specially crafted Groovy script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sandbox Bypass:** The primary vulnerability was the ability to bypass the Groovy script sandbox. This is due to insufficient protection during the parsing, compilation, and instantiation of Groovy scripts.
*   **Insecure Script Validation:** The HTTP endpoint used for script validation was also vulnerable to the same bypass.
*   **Lack of Privilege check:** The HTTP endpoint did not check permissions allowing users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller, as the system Groovy scripts runs inside the Jenkins master's JVM. This could lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to bypass the sandbox allowed users with read permissions to gain admin-level access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **System Groovy Script Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious Groovy code through the "System Groovy" build step.
*   **HTTP Endpoint:** The vulnerability also affects the HTTP endpoint used for script validation, allowing attackers to exploit it to execute code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Overall/Read Permission:**  An attacker with Overall/Read permission within Jenkins is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Craft Groovy Scripts:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Groovy script designed to bypass the sandbox.
*   **Access to Configure System Groovy Scripts:** The attacker needs to be able to configure the system groovy build step, which is limited to users with administrator permissions in a normal configuration. However, if the token macro plugin support is enabled, any user can trigger the system groovy script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is related to a larger set of security issues announced in Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-03-06.
*   The fix involves applying the sandbox protection during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation using the Script Security plugin's APIs.
*   The `GroovySandbox#run(Script, Whitelist)` API has been deprecated and `GroovySandbox#run(GroovyShell, String, Whitelist)` and `GroovySandbox#checkScriptForCompilationErrors(String, GroovyClassLoader)` are to be used instead.
*   The advisory also mentions that if token macro processing via the Token Macro Plugin is allowed, the evaluation of macros is done in System Groovy. This means any user can execute arbitrary system scripts regardless of their admin privileges.
