Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Hyper.sh Commons Plugin stores credentials in plain text within its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The plugin does not encrypt the Hyper.sh credentials, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller file system can read the stored credentials in plain text, potentially compromising the Hyper.sh account associated with the credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** Attackers can access the Jenkins controller file system through various means (e.g., compromised server, unauthorized access).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Jenkins Controller:**  The attacker needs to have access to the file system of the Jenkins controller where the plugin's configuration file is stored.
- **Privilege:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to read the plugin's configuration file (sh.hyper.plugins.hypercommons.Tools.xml)

**Additional Details:**
- The identified vulnerability is specific to the Hyper.sh Commons Plugin.
- The global configuration file `sh.hyper.plugins.hypercommons.Tools.xml` is the location where credentials are stored.
- The vulnerability allows users with access to the Jenkins controller file system to view the credentials
