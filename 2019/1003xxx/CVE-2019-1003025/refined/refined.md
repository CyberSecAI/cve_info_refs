Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1003025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Cloud Foundry plugin had a form validation method that lacked permission checks.
*   This method also did not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The plugin's form validation method didn't verify if the user had the necessary permissions to perform the action.
*  **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method could be triggered via GET requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*   **Credential Exposure:** By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker could connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, effectively capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal credentials stored within Jenkins, as they could force the plugin to connect to arbitrary URLs using provided credentials IDs.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers could potentially trigger other actions that rely on the plugin by exploiting the lack of permission checks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker provides a crafted URL in the form validation method.
*   **Credentials ID Injection:** An attacker specifies the credential IDs of the target user.
*   **CSRF:** By enticing a logged-in user to access a malicious URL or HTML page, the attacker can trick the user's browser into sending a request to the vulnerable form validation method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Overall/Read Access to Jenkins:** An attacker needs at least Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Credential IDs:** The attacker also needs to know (or guess) valid credential IDs stored in Jenkins.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding permission checks and requiring POST requests for the vulnerable form validation method.
*   The fix requires users to have Overall/Administer permissions for global configurations or Item/Configure permissions for job configurations.
*   The affected version of the Cloud Foundry Plugin is 2.3.1 and earlier.
*   The fixed version is 2.3.2.
