## Description

![@Vulcanun](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21147974?u=fa59db8f89e4fa884c2f5c36c41a0038dd133d24&v=4&size=48)[Vulcanun](https://github.com/Vulcanun)opened [on Dec 3, 2019](https://github.com/archerysec/archerysec/issues/338#issue-531680066)

Upon a security analysis of the platform, a stored cross site scripting vulnerability was identified on the Web and Infrastructure Scan Scheduler's project dropdown selection.

The payload is present on the project name attribute, but it is only executed upon javascript interaction by the Select2 library utilized on that specific menu. Upon deletion of the **archerysec/static/js/select2.min.js** file, the vulnerability was not present anymore (as were the library functionalities).

The vulnerability is not present on the python interactions, it is the live search function from select2 that evaluates and (possibly) decodes HTML Entities from the payload.

**How To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Create a project with the name "`XSS<img src=x onerror='prompt(1)'>`"
2. Click "**Launch Scans**" on the left-side menu
3. Proceed to either "**Dynamic Scans**" or "**Infrastructure Scans**"
4. Click "**Scan Schedule**"
5. Click the project dropdown selection

**Expected behavior**

After reproducing the steps above, a pop up should appear prompting the user with "1"
