Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-20008:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root cause:** The vulnerability arises from the way the Select2 JavaScript library handles project names within the Web and Infrastructure Scan Scheduler's project dropdown. Specifically, the library appears to evaluate and potentially decode HTML entities present in the project name, leading to the execution of injected JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code injected into the project name is stored in the database and executed when a user interacts with the project dropdown.
*   **Insecure handling of user input:** The application fails to sanitize or properly encode user-supplied project names before they are displayed by the Select2 library.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when they interact with the project dropdown on the scan scheduler page. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Potential further attacks on other users if this user has elevated permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to create a project with a malicious payload in the project name.
*   The attack is triggered when another user navigates to the scan scheduler page and interacts with the project dropdown.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must have the ability to create projects.
*   No specific user level is explicitly stated, however, it is implied that the attacker can create projects, which is not available to all users.
*   The attacker can be any user that has the ability to create projects and provide a malicious payload in the project name.

**Additional Information:**
* The issue was found on the project dropdown selection within the Web and Infrastructure Scan Scheduler.
* The vulnerability is triggered by the Javascript Select2 library.
* Deleting the select2.min.js file stops the vulnerability from being triggered.
* The vulnerability is triggered via HTML injection via the project name.
