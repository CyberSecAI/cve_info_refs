Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Add Field" module of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center. Specifically, it allows the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into field descriptions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious HTML or JavaScript code injected into field descriptions is stored and executed when other users view the affected fields, leading to an XSS vulnerability.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically field descriptions, allowing HTML/JavaScript code to be stored and rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser.
- Potential for Account Compromise: The attacker could potentially steal user session cookies, manipulate user interfaces, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.
- Data Manipulation/Theft: An attacker could potentially modify or steal data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the "Add Field" module in Jira.
- An attacker needs to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the field descriptions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Administrative Privileges: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges in order to access the "Add Field" functionality and inject the malicious code. This is a crucial limitation noted in the provided information, significantly reducing the attack surface.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 8.02 and fixed in version 8.7.0 of Jira Server and Data Center.
- Atlassian has provided a manual workaround for users who cannot upgrade to version 8.7.0. The workaround involves disabling "Enable HTML in field descriptions and list values" setting in the Jira settings.
- The risk of exploitation is considered low due to the required administrative privileges.
- The vulnerability is labeled with "cvss-medium," reflecting its moderate severity, but it also has been included in their bug bounty program which means it was recognized as important.
- A related issue (JRASERVER-44458) mentioned relates to the use of Javascript in description fields should require explicit configuration.
