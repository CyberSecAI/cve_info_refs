The provided content is related to a commit in the `nim-httpauth` repository, which implements password hashing using `libsodium`. The commit message indicates a fix for issue #23 and implementation of `libsodium`'s `crypto_pwhash_str`. The key changes introduced in this commit relevant to security are:

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The commit message itself states: "WARNING: Version 0.2.0 is not backward compatible due previously weak password hashing". This implies that previous versions had a weakness in the password hashing implementation, which was addressed in this commit by switching to libsodium's `crypto_pwhash_str`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- **Weak Password Hashing (in previous versions)**: Older versions of the library used an insecure approach to password hashing, which was replaced by `crypto_pwhash_str`, a secure hashing algorithm from libsodium. The previous implementation was not detailed in this commit's diff, but its weakness is implied in the commit message. The diff shows the removal of the old `hash_scrypt` and `hash_argon2` functions.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- **Compromised User Credentials (in previous versions)**: An attacker who obtained the password hashes from previous versions might have been able to crack them relatively easily due to the use of weak hashing algorithms (Scrypt or Argon2 implementation was flawed), gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors**:
- **Password Database Access (previous versions)**: If an attacker gained access to the user database containing the password hashes from previous versions, they could attempt to crack these hashes offline.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- **Access to Password Hashes (previous versions)**: The attacker needed access to the stored password hashes from the vulnerable versions.

**Additional Details**
- **libsodium integration:** This commit integrates `libsodium`'s `crypto_pwhash_str` for password hashing, which is a recommended practice.
- **Automatic re-hashing:** The library automatically regenerates password hashes upon login if an older hash format is detected, ensuring that the database is updated with the more secure hashes gradually.
- **Removal of insecure methods:** The commit removes the previous implementations of `hash_scrypt` and `hash_argon2`, as they were replaced by `crypto_pwhash_str`.
- **Test additions**: Unit tests for the new password hashing functionality are included in this commit.
- **Warning:** The README.adoc includes a warning to users about the non-backward compatibility due to the changed hashing implementation and encourages to filter user input against common web attacks.
