```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `set_text_free` function within `preproc.c`, triggered during the expansion of a string macro. Specifically, the `memcpy` in `set_text_free` attempts to copy more data than allocated buffer can hold.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in `preproc.c`.
- Invalid `free()` operation, which suggests double free or use after free.
- Memory leaks

Impact of exploitation:
- Program crash
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (due to heap corruption).

Attack vectors:
- By crafting a malicious assembly file with a specific string macro, an attacker could cause the overflow by triggering the `set_text_free` function with an overly large string.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to provide a crafted assembly file to be processed by the vulnerable NASM version.
