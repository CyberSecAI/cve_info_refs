Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20439

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `roles` field when defining the scope for an API in the WSO2 API Manager. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. User-supplied input in the "roles" field is not sanitized, and the injected code is reflected back in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users. This can lead to:
    - **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** The attacker could redirect the user's browser to a malicious website.
    - **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker can perform unauthorized actions such as modifying the UI of the webpage, stealing information from the browser.
    - **Session Hijacking (Mitigated):** While session hijacking is mentioned, it's noted that sensitive cookies are protected with the `httpOnly` flag, which mitigates the risk of directly stealing cookies via XSS. However, other actions due to a successful XSS attack might still expose the user to risks, even if session hijacking isn't possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Roles" field in the API scope management page of the WSO2 API Manager's publisher interface.
- An attacker crafts a malicious script and injects it as a value for the `roles` field while creating or modifying an API scope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WSO2 API Manager as a user with the ability to create or modify APIs, to access the vulnerable page.
- The attacker should have access to the API management interface, and be able to modify API scopes to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges besides being an authenticated user.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) is provided using the payload: `<img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>`.
- The issue was reported and acknowledged by WSO2 and a fix was implemented.
- The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
- The provided patch is `WSO2-CARBON-PATCH-4.4.0-5179`.
