# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2019-20439 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/low.png)

Severity:Low

#### Vendor

##### WSO2

#### Affected Product

##### WSO2 API Manager

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20439

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-11-1031

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### July 6, 2019

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered on WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0 in defining the scope toÂ manage the API page of the API Publisher. An input variable vulnerable to stored XSS is ârolesâ on the API page. A reflected cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the scope to an API in the API publisher by providing XSS payload as a value for roles.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on the WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0 Product.

Issue 01: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-1(24).png)***

***Figure 01:* *Start creating an API.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-2(22).png)

***Figure 02:* *Click on the Add Scope button to add resources information.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-3(22).png)

***Figure 03:* *Enter XSS Payload the Roles section.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-4(20).png)

***Figure 04:* *Injected XSS payload, <img src=x onerror=prompt(1)> gets reflected in the same browser as response.***

### Impact

Through an XSS attack, the attacker can make the browser redirect to a malicious website. Unauthorized actions such as changing the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser are possible. But since all session-related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flat and protected, session hijacking or mounting a similar attack would not be possible.

### Remediations

Download the relevant patch based on the product version.
