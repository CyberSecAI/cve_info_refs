## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 32 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC231](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC231 "Changes/GLIBC231")
* [BINUTILS233](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS233 "Changes/BINUTILS233")
* [FontLangProvidesToLangpacks](/wiki/Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks "Changes/FontLangProvidesToLangpacks")
* [golang1.14](/wiki/Changes/golang1.14 "Changes/golang1.14")
* [GCC10](/wiki/Changes/GCC10 "Changes/GCC10")
* [Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0](/wiki/Changes/Free_Pascal_Compiler_3.2.0 "Changes/Free Pascal Compiler 3.2.0")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Monday, January 27th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f32
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f32. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f32 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f32
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f32-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f32 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

# [EN] A-Z: PrBoom-plus (part I)

[PrBoom-plus](http://prboom-plus.sourceforge.net/) is a Doom source port based on PrBoom (which itself is based on other projects). It supports Windows, Mac, Linux and BSD systems. As I’m a Doom fan by myself I decided to get PrBoom-plus and analyze it from security perspective.

[![start](/images/doom/prboom0-50.png)](/images/doom/prboom0.png)

## Compilation with ASAN

I started with downloading the project from repository and preparing for compilation with ASAN.

```
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus# svn co https://svn.prboom.org/repos/branches/prboom-plus-24/prboom2/
```

According to `INSTALL` file I installed required packages.

```
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus#  apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-image-dev libpcre3-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libfluidsynth-dev libportmidi-dev libmad0-dev libdumb1-dev libvorbis-dev
```

Also, I added useful compilator flags, because it appeared that `CFLAGS` environment variable placed additional parameters in invalid order, making them useless.

```
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2# sed -i 's/^CFLAGS_OPT=.*/CFLAGS_OPT="-O0 -ggdb3"/' configure.ac
```

After such preparation I was able to compile the project with ASAN.

```
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2# ./bootstrap
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2# CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=address" ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/bin
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2# make install
```
## Game data

After compilation, there was the last step required before running the game. PrBoom-Plus is just an engine, so it requires game data to run. I was mostly interested in multiplayer part, so I chose FreeDM, the multiplayer part of [Freedoom](https://freedoom.github.io/download.html) project.

```
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus# wget https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/releases/download/v0.11.3/freedm-0.11.3.zip
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus# unzip freedm-0.11.3.zip
```
## First run and crash

When everything was ready, it was possible to run the server and the client.

```
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/prboom-plus/prboom2/bin/games# ./prboom-plus-game-server
Listening on port 5030, waiting for 2 players
```

The first crash occured immediately, just by running the client.

```

## Analyzing first crash

The client crashes on reading outisde a buffer in `ChecksumPacket` function in `src/SDL/i_network.c:221`.

```
212  static byte ChecksumPacket(const packet_header_t* buffer, size_t len)
213  {
214    const byte* p = (const void*)buffer;
215    byte sum = 0;
216
217    if (len==0)
218      return 0;
219
220    while (p++, --len)
221      sum += *p;
222
223    return sum;
224  }
```

It seemed that `len` variable has greater values than size of `p` buffer. This function was called from `I_GetPacket` in `src/SDL/i_network.c:243`.

```
226  size_t I_GetPacket(packet_header_t* buffer, size_t buflen)
227  {
228    int checksum;
229    size_t len;
230    int status;
231
232    status = SDLNet_UDP_Recv(udp_socket, udp_packet);
233    len = udp_packet->len;
234    if (buflen<len)
235      len=buflen;
236    if ( (status!=0) && (len>0) )
237      memcpy(buffer, udp_packet->data, len);
(...)
242    if ( (status!=0) && (len>0)) {
243      byte psum = ChecksumPacket(buffer, udp_packet->len);
(...)
249  }
```

Here the problem starts to become visible. Value from `udp_packet->len` is assigned to a `len` variable. Then, there’s a check (line 234) to ensure `les` is not greater than `buflen` (`buffer`’s size). If it is, `les` is reduced to value of `buflen`. Invocation of `memcpy` properly uses `len` variable, so no data will be written outside the buffer. However, invocation of `ChecksumPacket` uses `udp_packet->len` which may be greater than `buffer`’s size, finally leading to reading outside it.
To fix this bug, I passed `len` variable, the same way as it is done with `memcpy`.

After recompilation, the game started to work (the game requires two players to start, the client’s command should be ran twice)

[![two clients](/images/doom/prboom1-50.png)](/images/doom/prboom1.png)

## Fuzzing

I wanted to fuzz network part of the project. The idea was very simple - collect some network data samples, modify and send. Implementation was even more simplier and naive. I began with collecting data. I ran Wireshark, played the game for a while (2 player game by myself, it was quite strange) and saved the traffic. Then downloaded and built radamsa and installed scapy.

```
root@ubuntu16:~/projects# git clone https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa.git
root@ubuntu16:~/projects# cd radamsa
root@ubuntu16:~/projects/radamsa# make install
```

```
root@ubuntu16:~# pip install --pre scapy[basic]
```

Scapy script responsible for parsing data, modifying with radamsa (I know it’s inefficient) and resend. To fuzz the client instead of the server, UDP port should be changed from 5030 to 1024. The first line in `s` function calculates a checksum which validated after being received.

```
import subprocess
import base64

def s(d):
 c = chr(sum([ord(x) for x in d])%256)
 p = c + d
 send(IP(dst="10.1.1.109")/UDP(dport=5030,sport=12345)/p)

def radamsa(val, seed):
    val = base64.b64encode(val)
    o = subprocess.check_output("echo '" + val + "' | base64 -d | /usr/bin/radamsa -n 1 --seed " + str(seed), shell=True)
    return o

def start(seed, data):
  while True:
    for d in data:
      r = radamsa(d, seed)
      s(r)
    seed += 1

pcap = rdpcap("doom.pcap")
udps = [ p for p in pcap if UDP in p and p[UDP].dport == 5030 ]
data = list(set([ x[UDP].load[1:] for x in udps ]))
start(0, data)
```

Note: for some reason packets sent between the client and the server from the same machine didn’t reach their destination. A workaround was to clone my virtual machine and run fuzzing from it.

## Crashes

After a while two crashes were found, the first one in the server, and the second one in the client. However, they are related and share similar bug.

### Server crash 1

Minimal payload to crash `\xb6\x05\x01\x01\x56\x33\x27\xff\x00`.

```
# echo -n -e '\xb6\x05\x01\x01\x56\x33\x27\xff\x00' | nc -u 10.1.1.109 5030
```

results in:

```

The program tried to write 10991 bytes to a buffer with 10000 bytes on a heap in `I_SendPacketTo` in `src/SDL/i_network.c:261`.

```
258  void I_SendPacketTo(packet_header_t* packet, size_t len, UDP_CHANNEL *to)
259  {
260    packet->checksum = ChecksumPacket(packet, len);
261    memcpy(udp_packet->data, packet, udp_packet->len = len);
262    SDLNet_UDP_Send(udp_socket, *to, udp_packet);
263  }
```

From this I assummed that `len` variable was greater than length of `udp_packet->data`, so I started digging.

```
88  void I_InitNetwork(void)
89  {
(...)
92    udp_packet = SDLNet_AllocPacket(10000);
```

UDP packet has fixed size of 10000 bytes. A packet from which data was copied is allocated in `main` function in `src/d_server.c:688`.

```
680    for (i=0; i<MAXPLAYERS; i++)
681      if (playerstate[i] == pc_playing) {
682        int tics;
683        if (lowtic <= remoteticto[i]) continue;
684        if ((remoteticto[i] -= xtratics) < 0) remoteticto[i] = 0;
685        tics = lowtic - remoteticto[i];
686        {
687          byte *p;
688          packet = malloc(sizeof(packet_header_t) + 1 +
689           tics * (1 + numplayers * (1 + sizeof(ticcmd_t))));
(...)
707          }
708          I_SendPacketTo(packet, p - ((byte*)packet), remoteaddr+i);
```

`tics` variable was the only variable partially controlled from network input, so I followed how it was set.

`remoteticto` is set here:

```
565          remoteticto[from] = ptic(packet);
```

This array is signed int type,

```
461      int remoteticto[MAXPLAYERS] = { 0, 0, 0, 0 };
```

but a packet received over network is parsed to `packet_header_t` structure with `unsigned tic` (`0xff273356` from the payload). When `tic` is assigned to the array (line 565), integer overflow occurs and it becomes a negative value (`-14208170`). In the result, in line 684, this whole value is zeroed. `lowtic` is the only variable on which `tics` depends (line 685).
`lowtic` is taken from `remoteticfrom` which grows itself as the game is started and players connected. In practice waiting for less than 20 seconds was enough to get `lowtic` greater than `525`, which resulted in the allocated buffer bigger than 10000 bytes and finally in heap buffer overflow.

```
(gdb) printf "%u\n" ,sizeof(packet_header_t) + 1 + (525) * (1 + numplayers * (1 + sizeof(ticcmd_t)))
9984
(gdb) printf "%u\n" ,sizeof(packet_header_t) + 1 + (526) * (1 + numplayers * (1 + sizeof(ticcmd_t)))
10003
```

```

A function `I_SendPacket` in `src/SDL/i_network.c:254` copies more bytes than allocated fixed 10000 bytes in UDP packet.

```
251  void I_SendPacket(packet_header_t* packet, size_t len)
252  {
253    packet->checksum = ChecksumPacket(packet, len);
254    memcpy(udp_packet->data, packet, udp_packet->len = len);
255    SDLNet_UDP_Send(udp_socket, 0, udp_packet);
256  }
```

I looked how `size_t len` is calculated in `src/d_client.c` and this problem looked similar to the previous one.

```
300        case PKT_RETRANS: // Resend request
301            remotesend = doom_ntohl(packet->tic);
(...)
350      if (server && maketic > remotesend) { // Send the tics to the server
351        int sendtics;
352        remotesend -= xtratics;
353        if (remotesend < 0) remotesend = 0;
354        sendtics = maketic - remotesend;
355        {
356    size_t pkt_size = sizeof(packet_header_t) + 2 + sendtics * sizeof(ticcmd_t);
357    packet_header_t *packet = Z_Malloc(pkt_size, PU_STATIC, NULL);
(...)
369    I_SendPacket(packet, pkt_size);
```

`remotesend` is a signed integer, but `tic` in `packet` is unsigned, so integer overflow occurs and `0xff273356` from the payload becomes a negative value. In line 353 `remotesend` is zeroed, so `sendtics` depends only on `maketic`. This variable grows itself as the game is on, and when it reaches `1249` (in practice it was less than a minute) the allocated buffer is bigger than fixed 10000 bytes and heap buffer overflow occurs.

```
(gdb) print sizeof(packet_header_t) + 2 + 1249 * sizeof(ticcmd_t)
$17 = 10002
(gdb) print sizeof(packet_header_t) + 2 + 1248 * sizeof(ticcmd_t)
$18 = 9994
```
## Summary

The first crash was found just after starting the game, the next two after very quick and naive fuzzing. I don’t consider this topic as closed, but I reported my findings and I’m moving to looking for another vulnerabilities using various approaches.
