Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `prboom-plus` game engine when handling UDP packets in both client and server modes. This arises from inconsistencies in how packet sizes are managed during network communication. Specifically, the `ChecksumPacket` function in `i_network.c` reads beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer because it uses the potentially larger `udp_packet->len` instead of the adjusted buffer length after a size check. Additionally, in both client and server, there are integer overflow issues in how the `tic` value from the received packets is used which can lead to allocation of larger buffers than the fixed size for UDP packets. These are copied to the fixed size UDP packet which causes a heap buffer overflow in the `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when data is written beyond the allocated memory boundaries in heap memory.
*   **Incorrect Length Handling:** The `ChecksumPacket` function uses the length of the received packet directly (udp_packet->len) which can exceed the allocated buffer's size.
*  **Integer Overflow:** Signed integer overflows when `tic` values are copied from UDP packets into signed integers. This allows attackers to create overly large packets.
* **Fixed-Size UDP packet buffer:** The `udp_packet` is allocated with a fixed size which limits the maximum size of data it can store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a crash due to a heap-based buffer overflow, effectively causing a denial of service for the client or server.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap overflows can be a starting point for more severe attacks if exploited correctly, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered via specially crafted UDP packets sent to the vulnerable `prboom-plus` client or server.
*   **Client and Server Exploitation:** Both the client and server components are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the target machine running the vulnerable `prboom-plus` client or server.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft UDP packets with specific values in order to cause the integer overflow and trigger the buffer overflow in `memcpy` operation.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content shows that the vulnerability affects multiple versions of Fedora and openSUSE.
* The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity by SUSE.
* Patches for this issue have been released for openSUSE and Fedora.
* The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
