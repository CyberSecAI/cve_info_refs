Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20839:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content from multiple sources, including SUSE, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, and the upstream LibVNCServer repository on GitHub, confirms that this content relates to CVE-2019-20839, which is a buffer overflow vulnerability within `libvncserver`.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `ConnectClientToUnixSock()` function within the `libvncclient/sockets.c` file of LibVNCServer. This function fails to properly validate the length of a provided Unix socket filename before copying it into a fixed-size buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where a string longer than the allocated space is written, leading to memory corruption.
   - **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper bounds checking on the length of the socket filename input, allowing for the overflow.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Denial of Service:** The primary impact of exploitation, as described by Red Hat, is a crash due to compiled-in buffer overflow checks which can be triggered by providing a long filename, thus, leading to a denial of service.
  - **Potential Code Execution:** While the Red Hat statement mentions the overflow is caught by compiled-in checks, the upstream description notes the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, and other sources mention the potential for arbitrary code execution with crafted inputs. Therefore, while a crash is the most likely, remote code execution cannot be fully ruled out.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered over the network, specifically through the VNC protocol. An attacker can send a crafted message including an overly long socket filename to a vulnerable server, exploiting the lack of proper input validation within `ConnectClientToUnixSock()`.
   - **Local:** It's implied the vulnerability can be exploited by a process using the affected function with an improperly crafted socket filename.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to a vulnerable system, or the ability to cause a local process to execute the vulnerable code.
   - **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Unix socket filename string with a length exceeding the buffer size within `ConnectClientToUnixSock()` function.
   - **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication according to SUSE and Ubuntu information.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in `ConnectClientToUnixSock()` due to lack of input validation on socket filename length.
*   **Weaknesses:** Buffer overflow, missing input validation.
*  **Impact:** Denial of service (crash), potential for remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network and possibly local, via crafted input of an overly long socket filename.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Network access, ability to craft the malicious socket filename, no authentication needed.
*   **Affected Component:** `libvncclient/sockets.c`.
*   **Upstream Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in LibVNCServer version 0.9.13, through commit `3fd03977c9b35800d73a865f167338cb4d05b0c1`.
