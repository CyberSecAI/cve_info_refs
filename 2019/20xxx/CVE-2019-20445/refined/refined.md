  "CVE-2019-20445": {
    "description": "HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows a Content-Length header to be accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header.",
    "root_cause": "The `HttpObjectDecoder.java` in Netty allows multiple `Content-Length` headers, or a `Content-Length` header along with a `Transfer-Encoding` header in an HTTP request.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "HTTP request smuggling"
    ],
    "impact": "This vulnerability can lead to HTTP request smuggling.",
     "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending a crafted HTTP request with multiple Content-Length headers or both a Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding header."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send crafted HTTP requests.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because of incorrect handling of HTTP headers by the `HttpObjectDecoder.java`.  Specifically, the decoder does not reject requests containing multiple `Content-Length` headers or both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers, which can lead to misinterpretation of request boundaries and subsequent request smuggling."
