# RICOH Streamline NX

RICOH Streamline NX offers a total solution for secure and large-scale, integrated management of devices. In addition to providing remote management of device settings, monitoring of devices, and output of reports, RICOH Streamline NX can also expand the print and scan functionality of devices.

The expanded functionality of the devices can improve user convenience and administrator operation efficiency for management cost savings.
The RICOH Streamline NX system also offers the use of cards, PINs, and other personal authentication functions to strengthen the security of devices and reduce the risk of information leaks.

In addition, RICOH Streamline NX can be used to monitor and manage network devices.

The system can immediately detect a problem on a connected device located anywhere around the world to help minimize downtime. In addition, the system can apply initial settings collectively and remotely on a large scale to newly installed devices.

Administrators can manage all connected devices centrally through a unified web interface without having to install special software to the client computer.
