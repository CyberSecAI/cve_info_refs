### Description

Various installation setup resources in Jira before version 8.5.2 allow remote attackers to configure a Jira instance, which has not yet finished being installed, via Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

Once a Jira instance is setup (i.e. database, admin account, licence, etc. form are filled) the vulnerability can't be exploited anymore.
