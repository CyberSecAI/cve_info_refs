The content is related to CVE-2019-20401.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in various installation setup resources of Jira Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerabilities allowed remote attackers to configure a Jira instance that has not yet finished being installed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers could configure a Jira instance before it was fully set up.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers could exploit the CSRF vulnerability through various installation setup resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to make a request to the vulnerable Jira instance during the setup process. The attacker would need to target an instance that is not yet fully installed, meaning the Jira setup wizard is still accessible.
