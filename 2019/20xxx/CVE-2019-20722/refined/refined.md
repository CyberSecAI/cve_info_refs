The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20722. It describes a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router, gateway and WiFi system models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a post-authentication command injection flaw. Specific details of the vulnerable code or function are not included in this document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The system fails to properly sanitize user input allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full system compromise: The injected commands would execute with the same privileges as the vulnerable service on the router.
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
- Complete Loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability: Through command injection, an attacker can access and modify sensitive data, as well as disrupt the normal operation of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is launched through the device's network interface.
- Web interface: The vulnerability is likely present in the web interface or related services that are accessible through the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: Attackers must have valid credentials to login to the administrative web interface before being able to exploit the vulnerability.
- Network access: Attackers need to be able to reach the vulnerable web interface of the affected device.
