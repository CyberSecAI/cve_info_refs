The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Determine Selectica Contract Lifecycle Management (SCLM) version 5.4, and includes details on a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability which corresponds to CVE-2019-20155.

**Root cause of the RCE vulnerability:**
The root cause is the default granting of the "Can View and Run Reports" permission to all user roles. This allows any authenticated user to create and execute arbitrary code via the report scripting functionality using the Groovy language.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure default permissions that allows any user to execute code.
- Lack of input validation or sanitization on the script execution functionality.
- The usage of Groovy scripting language, that can be used to execute arbitrary commands in the OS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full control of the server by the attacker.
- Ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Potential for data breaches, malware installation, and complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can leverage the report creation and execution functionality via the application's web interface.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks can be used to force authenticated users to execute malicious Groovy code by making them visit a crafted web page or load a malicious image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the application to exploit the RCE directly.
- For CSRF, the attacker needs to lure a legitimate, authenticated user to visit a malicious page or load a crafted image while the user is authenticated to the application.
