Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20364:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation and output encoding in the Openfire application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `cacheName` parameter of the `SystemCacheDetails.jsp` page, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected and executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. The application takes user input from the `cacheName` parameter in the URL, and reflects it back into the HTML output without sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application doesn't properly validate the input received through the `cacheName` parameter. Special characters, such as those used in Javascript, are not filtered or encoded.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application doesn't encode the user-supplied input before reflecting it in the response. This allows injected script to be interpreted as executable code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can leverage this XSS vulnerability to:
-   **Steal Cookies:** Malicious scripts can be injected to steal user session cookies, allowing an attacker to impersonate the victim.
-   **End-User File Disclosure:** Although not detailed, it may be possible for an attacker to access sensitive files on the end-user system by exploiting the XSS.
-   **User Redirection:** An attacker could redirect the user to a malicious site or page.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Browser:** The XSS allows arbitrary Javascript code to run within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted GET request to the vulnerable page (`SystemCacheDetails.jsp`) by including a malicious payload within the `cacheName` URL parameter.
-  **User Interaction:** The victim must access the malicious URL, either through a link or similar means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript payload.
-  The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious URL to a victim.
-   The attacker needs no special access to the application other than being able to send requests to the vulnerable page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified by Securin (CSW).
- The vulnerability was tested on Openfire version 4.4.4.
- A fix was released by the vendor on December 31, 2019. The fix included input validation for special characters and client-side validation.
- The issue was addressed in the 4.5.0 milestone of Openfire.
