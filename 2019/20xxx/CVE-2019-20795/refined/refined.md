Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20795:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition in the `get_netnsid_from_name` function within `ip/ipnetns.c` of the `iproute2` package. Specifically, a memory buffer (`answer`) allocated to store the response from a netlink socket is freed prematurely before a value is read from its content via `rta_getattr_u32(tb[NETNSA_NSID])`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is that the `answer` buffer is freed using the `free(answer)` function call, then a pointer to that memory is dereferenced when accessing its contents with `rta_getattr_u32(tb[NETNSA_NSID])`, resulting in a use-after-free.
- **Incorrect Memory Management:** The code frees the allocated memory for the netlink message before it finishes processing the message's attributes.
- **Conditional Free:** The premature free operation is affected by the `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_` environment variable.  When this is set to 0, `malloc` uses `mmap` to allocate memory, which is freed immediately by a subsequent `free()` operation. This makes the vulnerability easily reproducible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service. When the program attempts to access the freed memory, it leads to a segmentation fault or program crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local:** The attacker needs to be able to execute commands, specifically the `ip netns` command. This makes it a local exploit.
- **Crafted input:** The attacker must also be able to influence how memory is allocated by manipulating environment variables such as `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute shell commands on the target system.
- **Environment Manipulation:** They need to be able to set environment variables, such as `MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=0` to trigger the use-after-free more easily.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in `iproute2` version 4.15 with commit `86bf43c7c2f`, and backported into `4.12` based branches.
- The bug is triggered when listing network namespaces (`ip netns list`).
- The fix involves moving the call to `free(answer)` to occur after the value is read from the `tb[NETNSA_NSID]` attribute, ensuring the memory is still valid when the attribute is accessed.
- This vulnerability is not easily remotely exploitable.
