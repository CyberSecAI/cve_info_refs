{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate the type of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files by changing the Content-Type of the request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file upload vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server via uploading a PHP web shell. An attacker could gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, and use the server as a launchpad for further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a malicious file with a modified Content-Type to bypass the application's file type checks via an exposed web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to access the application's file upload functionality, which may require initial access to the application's interface via stolen credentials."
