Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20213:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `phpcgi_main()` function processes HTTP requests. Specifically, a mistake in processing the request body allows bypassing authentication checks when accessing certain PHP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated information disclosure:** The primary weakness is that an attacker can bypass authentication and access sensitive information (like VPN configurations) without providing credentials.
- **Improper request handling:** The `phpcgi_main()` function doesn't correctly process request bodies, which leads to the authentication bypass.
- **Inadequate URL validation:**  The `cgibin_parse_request()` and `parse_uri()` functions do not properly sanitize input, leading to the injection of parameters that bypass authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information, including VPN configurations, by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP request manipulation:** By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, an attacker can bypass authentication and access sensitive data. The request includes a modified URL with a parameter like `?pwnd=%0a`.
- **LAN and WAN access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through both the LAN and WAN interfaces of the affected devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't need any authentication.
- They must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device, either from the local network or through the internet (if remote access is enabled).

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `phpcgi_main()` function of the `/htdocs/cgibin` binary on D-Link routers.
- The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the request body through a specially crafted query parameter in the URL. This bypasses authentication by setting the "AUTHORIZED_GROUP" parameter to 1.
- The `sess_validate()` function returns a value that is overwritten later, allowing an attacker to inject their own authorization value.

**Affected Products:**
- D-Link DIR-859 (specifically firmware versions 1.06b01 Beta01, 1.05 and older)
- Other D-Link routers are also vulnerable, as noted in the D-Link support announcement SAP10147.
     - DIR-818Lx Rev Bx
     - DIR-822 Rev Bx & Cx
     - DIR-823 Rev Ax
     - DIR-859 Rev Ax
     - DIR-865L Rev Ax

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Miguel Mendez Z. (s1kr10s) and Pablo Pollanco (secenv).
- D-Link has released firmware patches to address this issue.
- Some devices require a two-step update process.
- Some affected devices are End-of-Life, meaning they will not receive updates.
