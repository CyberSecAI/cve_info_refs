# Exploiting Postie WordPress Plugin

This PoC describe how to exploit Postie WordPress plugin <v1.9.40

I will describe two ways to explore the Postie v1.9.40 plugin for WordPress:

* [Spoofing valid user for post submission](https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/Exploiting-Postie-WordPress-Plugin-#poc-1---spoofing-valid-user-for-post-submission) // I published this [CVE-2019-20203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20203)
* [XSS with JavaScript Polyglot](https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/Exploiting-Postie-WordPress-Plugin-#poc-2---xss-with-javascript-polyglot) // I published this [CVE-2019-20204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20204)

### About Postie WordPress plugin

Postie allows you to create a post by simply sending an email. Create and edit your email in whatever email program you use. Click send and within a few minutes you have a new post!

More info [here](https://postieplugin.com/)

---

### PoC 1 - Spoofing valid user for post submission

The Postie plugin for WordPress only allows posting of articles submitted by authorized users through a mailing list registered in the plugin settings.

However through the email sender's spoofing technique (as example, i used the [Anonymailer website](http://www.anonymailer.net)) it was possible to bypass the plugin settings and publish a post as having been sent by a valid user, as shown in the images below.

Below we have the images of first PoC:

### PoC 2 - XSS with JavaScript Polyglot

Another way to exploit the Postie plugin was a Cross-Site Script (XSS) attack using Polyglot JavaScript syntax with crafted SVG, as follows:

`jaVasCript:/*--></title></style></textarea></script></xmp><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//'>`

The above syntax can be explained as follows:

* `jaVasCript`:: A label in ECMAScript; a URI scheme otherwise.
* `/-//*\/'/"/**/`: A multi-line comment in ECMAScript; a literal-breaker sequence.
* `(/* */oNcliCk=alert() )`: A tangled execution zone wrapped in invoking parenthesis!
* `//%0D%0A%0d%0a//`: A single-line comment in ECMAScript; a double-CRLF in HTTP response headers.
* `:` A sneaky HTML-tag-breaker sequence.
* `\x3csVg/\x3e`: An innocuous svg element.

This is a way to inject JavaScript code into post to bypass WordPress security policy through the Postie plugin vulnerability.

# Exploiting Postie WordPress Plugin

This PoC describe how to exploit Postie WordPress plugin <v1.9.40

I will describe two ways to explore the Postie v1.9.40 plugin for WordPress:

* [Spoofing valid user for post submission](https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/Exploiting-Postie-WordPress-Plugin-#poc-1---spoofing-valid-user-for-post-submission) // I published this [CVE-2019-20203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20203)
* [XSS with JavaScript Polyglot](https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/Exploiting-Postie-WordPress-Plugin-#poc-2---xss-with-javascript-polyglot) // I published this [CVE-2019-20204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20204)

### About Postie WordPress plugin

Postie allows you to create a post by simply sending an email. Create and edit your email in whatever email program you use. Click send and within a few minutes you have a new post!

More info [here](https://postieplugin.com/)

### PoC 1 - Spoofing valid user for post submission

The Postie plugin for WordPress only allows posting of articles submitted by authorized users through a mailing list registered in the plugin settings.

However through the email sender's spoofing technique (as example, i used the [Anonymailer website](http://www.anonymailer.net)) it was possible to bypass the plugin settings and publish a post as having been sent by a valid user, as shown in the images below.

### PoC 2 - XSS with JavaScript Polyglot

Another way to exploit the Postie plugin was a Cross-Site Script (XSS) attack using Polyglot JavaScript syntax with crafted SVG, as follows:

`jaVasCript:/*--></title></style></textarea></script></xmp><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//'>`

The above syntax can be explained as follows:

* `jaVasCript`:: A label in ECMAScript; a URI scheme otherwise.
* `/-//*\/'/"/**/`: A multi-line comment in ECMAScript; a literal-breaker sequence.
* `(/* */oNcliCk=alert() )`: A tangled execution zone wrapped in invoking parenthesis!
* `//%0D%0A%0d%0a//`: A single-line comment in ECMAScript; a double-CRLF in HTTP response headers.
* `:` A sneaky HTML-tag-breaker sequence.
* `\x3csVg/\x3e`: An innocuous svg element.

This is a way to inject JavaScript code into post to bypass WordPress security policy through the Postie plugin vulnerability.

### PoC 2 - XSS with JavaScript Polyglot

Another way to exploit the Postie plugin was a Cross-Site Script (XSS) attack using Polyglot JavaScript syntax with crafted SVG, as follows:

`jaVasCript:/*--></title></style></textarea></script></xmp><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//'>`

The above syntax can be explained as follows:

* `jaVasCript`:: A label in ECMAScript; a URI scheme otherwise.
* `/-//*\/'/"/**/`: A multi-line comment in ECMAScript; a literal-breaker sequence.
* `(/* */oNcliCk=alert() )`: A tangled execution zone wrapped in invoking parenthesis!
* `//%0D%0A%0d%0a//`: A single-line comment in ECMAScript; a double-CRLF in HTTP response headers.
* `:` A sneaky HTML-tag-breaker sequence.
* `\x3csVg/\x3e`: An innocuous svg element.

This is a way to inject JavaScript code into post to bypass WordPress security policy through the Postie plugin vulnerability.

Works great for me and I really love it! Helps when I’m at home where there’s poor cell signal. I can compose posts from my phone and put them in email outbox. When I drive for errands, I wouldn’t have time to blog, but there go the posts.
Thanks SO MUCH for your hard work in making this available and keeping updated.

Is a fantastic plugin, it allows a great flexibility, and if you set up correctly all the tags, you can save hours and hours! Super recommended

I have used postie for many years. It power six of my paid members websites and makes sending updates and posting in my members areas happen in a click! The support is second to none if you need help, and its so worth any minor issue you have if you have any, likely not if your running newer versions of WP, PHP, and the plugin.
