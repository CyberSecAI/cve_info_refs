  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2019-20203",
    "description": "The Postie plugin for WordPress before 1.9.41 allows spoofing of valid user for post submission. An attacker can send a crafted email using email spoofing techniques to bypass the plugin's authorization and publish a post as if it were sent by a valid user.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Postie plugin relies solely on the email sender address for authorization, without proper verification or authentication. This allows attackers to spoof the sender address and bypass the plugin's access controls.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Missing sender authentication",
        "Lack of email header verification"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can publish posts as an authorized user, potentially leading to content manipulation, misinformation, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is via email. An attacker spoofs the email sender address to match a valid user registered in the Postie plugin.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails and spoof the sender address. An external tool can be used to facilitate this."
