Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-20041:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an input sanitization bypass in WordPress's `wp_kses_bad_protocol()` function. This function is meant to validate that URI attributes do not contain disallowed protocols. However, it could be bypassed by using the HTML5 named entity for colon (`&colon;`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Input Sanitization Bypass:** The `wp_kses_bad_protocol()` function failed to recognize the HTML named entity for a colon (`&colon;`), leading to a bypass of the protocol filtering mechanism.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into links by using the named colon entity. This results in stored XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could craft malicious links containing harmful scripts. When unsuspecting users click these links, the scripts would execute in their browsers, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious links that include the HTML5 named entity for a colon (`&colon;`) in a URI attribute. This bypasses the input sanitization and allows the malicious script to be injected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject crafted links into content that is processed by WordPress. This could involve:
    - Posting malicious links in comments or posts.
    - Injecting malicious links through other means such as compromised plugins or themes.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability if the attacker can inject content to be rendered by wordpress.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix involved updating `wp_kses_bad_protocol()` to recognize the `&colon;` named entity, as well as other variants such as `&#58;`, `&#0058;` and `&#x03a`. This was done by including this entity in the regular expression used to split the string and sanitize it.
- The vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 5.3.1, as well as in older versions.
- Debian also released security updates for WordPress to address this vulnerability.
