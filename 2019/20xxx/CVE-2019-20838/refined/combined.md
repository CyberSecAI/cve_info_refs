**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!
