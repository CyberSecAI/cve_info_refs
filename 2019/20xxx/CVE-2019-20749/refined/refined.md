The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20749.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The exact nature of the vulnerability is not elaborated in this document, however the vulnerability appears to be related to user-supplied input being stored and later displayed without proper sanitization allowing for the execution of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This could lead to various impacts such as:
- Stealing user session cookies and gaining unauthorized access to the device's management interface.
- Defacing the device's management interface.
- Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
- Performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the device's web management interface. An attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code into a field that is later displayed to other users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to access the device's web management interface. This could be from a local network or potentially remotely, depending on the device's configuration.
- The attacker must have sufficient privileges to save malicious content.
