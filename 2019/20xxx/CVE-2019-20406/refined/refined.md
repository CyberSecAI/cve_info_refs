Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Confluence, when running on Microsoft Windows, utilizes Tomcat. Specifically, it is due to the loading of DLL files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DLL Hijacking:** The core issue is a DLL hijacking vulnerability. This occurs when an application attempts to load a DLL file without specifying its full path, causing it to search the directories in the system's PATH environment variable. A malicious actor can exploit this by placing a specially crafted DLL with the same name in a directory that's listed earlier in the PATH variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** By injecting a malicious DLL, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the Confluence application.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Since Confluence typically runs with higher privileges, a successful DLL hijacking attack could allow an attacker to escalate their local system privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have local system access on the Windows machine where Confluence is running.
- **Write Access:** The attacker must have permission to write a DLL file into a directory that is in the global PATH environment variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the Windows server where Confluence is installed.
- They must have the ability to create or modify files in a directory listed within the system's PATH environment variable.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Confluence versions before 7.0.5 and version 7.1.0 before 7.1.1.
- The fix involves correcting how Confluence loads DLL files to prevent hijacking.
- The issue is considered a medium severity vulnerability.
- SafeBreach Labs is credited for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.
