### Description

The usage of Tomcat in Confluence on the Microsoft Windows operating system before version 7.0.5, from version 7.1.0 before version 7.1.1 allows local system attackers who have permission to write a dll file in a directory in the global path environmental variable variable to inject code & escalate their privileges via a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

### Acknowledgment

We would like to thank Peleg Hadar of SafeBreach Labs for reporting this vulnerability.
