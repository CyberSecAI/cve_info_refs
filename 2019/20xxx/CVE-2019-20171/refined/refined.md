Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20171:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is memory leaks in two functions within the GPAC multimedia framework.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory leak in `metx_New` function located in `isomedia/box_code_base.c`.
- Memory leak in `abst_Read` function located in `isomedia/box_code_adobe.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Uncontrolled memory consumption. While not a critical vulnerability, repeated memory leaks can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions by exhausting system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file, which is provided as a "POC file" in the github issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to be processed by the vulnerable GPAC software.

**Additional details:**
- The github issue provides more detailed information, including the specific code locations and the sizes of memory leaked. The AddressSanitizer output shows the exact functions that cause the memory leaks, the number of leaked objects and their sizes, and the allocation call stack.

- The issue was found using a fuzzer based on AFL.
