The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, identified as PSV-2017-2228. Although it is not related to CVE-2019-20732 it is still useful vulnerability information.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after successful authentication on the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The advisory states a CVSS v3 score of 5.6, which is classified as "Medium".
- The provided vector indicates a high impact on Confidentiality (C:H), while there are lower impacts on Integrity (I:L) and Availability (A:L)
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain significant control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through post-authentication interaction with the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the device to exploit this vulnerability. This implies an authenticated attack, requiring the attacker to be in a position to access the device's web interface or other management interface.

**Affected Devices and Firmware Versions:**
The advisory lists a number of affected NETGEAR routers, gateways, and extenders, including but not limited to:
*   D6220, D7000v2, D8500, DGN2200v4, DGND2200Bv4
*   EX3700, EX3800, EX6000, EX6100, EX6120, EX6130, EX6150v1, EX6200, EX7000
*   R6250, R6300v2, R6400, R6400v2, R6700, R6900, R7000, R6900P, R7000P, R7100LG, R7300DST, R7900, R8000, R7900P, R8000P, R8300, R8500
*   WN2500RPv2, WNDR3400v3, WNR3500Lv2

It specifies the vulnerable firmware versions for each device, indicating that devices running firmware versions prior to those listed are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- The primary mitigation is to update the firmware of the affected devices to the versions specified in the advisory or later.
