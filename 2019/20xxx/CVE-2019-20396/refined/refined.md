Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way `libyang` parses and handles pattern statements within YANG data models. Specifically, a malformed pattern statement value can trigger a segmentation fault during the parsing process (`yyparse`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Malformed input:** The vulnerability arises from the ability of a crafted YANG input file with a malformed pattern statement to cause a crash. The issue report highlights a specific example of a malformed pattern, which leads to a segmentation fault.
- **Insufficient input validation:** `libyang` appears to lack proper input validation of the pattern statement values, allowing the parser to attempt to process invalid data and resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service. The program crashes (segmentation fault), causing the application using the `libyang` library to become unavailable. The debian security advisory also indicates that this could potentially lead to code execution but it is not explicitly stated how.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious YANG files:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted YANG file to an application using the vulnerable version of `libyang`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or influence the YANG input to `libyang`.  This could be through a file upload, data stream or other input mechanism of an application using `libyang`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "yang parser BUGFIX allocate more patterns than currently needed" and the related code changes, specifically in `src/parser_yang_bis.c` and `src/yang.y.in`, indicate that the fix involved addressing memory allocation issues related to pattern handling.  The fix appears to allocate enough memory to store pattern statements instead of relying on a fixed amount that would be overflowed by malformed pattern inputs.
- The issue was reported in issue #740, further detailing the specific malformed pattern input that caused the crash.
- Debian LTS advisory DLA-3572-1 lists CVE-2019-20396 among other vulnerabilities fixed in `libyang`, reinforcing that this CVE represents a real vulnerability in the library.
