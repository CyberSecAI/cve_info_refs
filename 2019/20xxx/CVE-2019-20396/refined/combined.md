### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v0.16-r3...v1.0-r1`

## Description

![@jvijtiuk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30860583?v=4&size=48)[jvijtiuk](https://github.com/jvijtiuk)opened [on Mar 29, 2019](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/740#issue-426922796)

Hello,

this file crashes libyang when it is parsed with lys\_parse\_path:

```
module xpath-1.1 {
    namespace "urn:xpath-1.1";
    prefix xp;

    container top {
        leaf identref {
            type mdentityref {
                base:iwo;
                     pattern '[A-Z]+';
                pattern '[A-Z]+';
                   pattern '[A-Z]+';
                    pattern '[A-Z]+';
                pattern '[./key2, 2, 3), 'a') and not(starts-with(./key2, 'a')))";
}

```

Regards,

Juraj

Package        : libyang
Version        : 0.16.105+really1.0-0+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-20391 CVE-2019-20392 CVE-2019-20393 CVE-2019-20394
                 CVE-2019-20395 CVE-2019-20396 CVE-2019-20397 CVE-2019-20398

Multiple flaws were found in libyang, a parser toolkit for IETF YANG data
modeling. Double frees, invalid memory access and Null pointer dereferences
may cause a denial of service or potentially code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.16.105+really1.0-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libyang packages.

For the detailed security status of libyang please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libyang>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
