The provided content relates to CVE-2019-20092. It describes a segmentation fault vulnerability in Bento4's `mp42ts` tool.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Vulnerability:** Segmentation fault (SEGV) due to a read memory access at address `0x000000000008` which points to the zero page.
*   **Root Cause:** The crash occurs within the `AP4_Descriptor::GetTag()` function. The AddressSanitizer output suggests that the program is trying to read a tag from a descriptor, but the descriptor or its associated data is invalid, leading to a null pointer dereference or access to an invalid memory location. Further analysis of the stack trace reveals that the issue occurs while processing sample descriptions within an MP4 file. The specific functions involved are:
    *   `AP4_Descriptor::GetTag()`
    *   `AP4_DescriptorFinder::Test()`
    *   `AP4_List<AP4_Descriptor>::Find()`
    *   `AP4_EsDescriptor::GetDecoderConfigDescriptor()` or `AP4_DecoderConfigDescriptor::GetDecoderSpecificInfoDescriptor()`
    *   `AP4_MpegSampleDescription::AP4_MpegSampleDescription()`
    *   `AP4_MpegAudioSampleDescription::AP4_MpegAudioSampleDescription()`
    *   `AP4_MpegAudioSampleEntry::ToSampleDescription()`
    *   `AP4_StsdAtom::GetSampleDescription()`
    *   `AP4_AtomSampleTable::GetSampleDescription()`
    *   `AP4_Track::GetSampleDescription()`
    *   `main` (in `Mp42Ts.cpp`)
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file (`poc` or `test-001.mp4-signalb-0x...`). The provided content includes two such "proof-of-concept" files (`poc1.zip` and `poc2.zip`).
*   **Impact:** The vulnerability results in a crash of the `mp42ts` tool. This could lead to a denial-of-service.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4 file to the `mp42ts` tool.
*   **Affected function:** `AP4_Descriptor::GetTag()`
