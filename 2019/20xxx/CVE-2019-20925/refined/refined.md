- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The message decompressor incorrectly allocates memory when processing specially crafted wire protocol messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory allocation in the decompression process when handling malformed network packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated client can cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted wire protocol messages over the network to a vulnerable MongoDB server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to a vulnerable MongoDB server instance, and does not require prior authentication.
