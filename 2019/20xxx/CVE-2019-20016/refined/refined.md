Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the issues:

**Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow

**Root cause:**

- **Issue #83:** The vulnerability is located in the `directblockRead` function within `fractalhead.c`. The issue arises from recursive calls to this function without proper bounds checking, leading to stack exhaustion and a crash. The fix introduces a `recursive_counter` to limit recursion depth.
- **Issue #84:** The vulnerability is located in the `readOHDRHeaderMessageDatatype` function within `dataobject.c`. It occurs when a specific data type (case 6) is encountered during parsing. The code allocates a large buffer (0x1000 bytes) for a component, but if the nested structure is too deep, this can cause a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Issue #83:** Unbounded recursion in `directblockRead` leading to stack overflow.
- **Issue #84:** Stack overflow when processing nested data structures due to large stack allocations within recursive calls.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): By providing a crafted input file, an attacker can cause the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**

-  A crafted SOFA file, that when parsed will trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted file that will trigger the recursive calls or trigger the vulnerable data type parsing.

**Additional Details:**

-   The provided ASAN logs and gdb backtraces confirm stack overflows.
-   The fix in commit `2e6fac6ab6156dae8e8c6f417741388084b70d6f` introduces a recursion counter to `directblockRead` in an attempt to limit stack usage.

Based on this information, the content relates to CVE-2019-20016 as it describes a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
