# Exec Maven Plugin

The plugin provides 2 goals to help execute system and Java programs.

## Goals Overview

General information about the goals.

* [exec:exec](./exec-mojo.html) execute programs and Java programs in a separate process.
* [exec:java](./java-mojo.html) execute Java programs in the same VM.
## Usage

General instructions on how to use the Exec Maven Plugin can be found on the [usage page](./usage.html).

In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please feel free to contact the [user mailing list](./mailing-lists.html). The posts to the mailing list are archived and could already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching the [mail archive](./mailing-lists.html).

If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our [issue tracker](./issue-management.html).

When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason, entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated. Of course, patches are most welcome too.

Contributors can check out the project from our [source repository](./scm.html) and will find supplementary information in the [Reporting an Issue](https://www.mojohaus.org/contribution/reporting-an-issue.html), [Submitting a Patch](https://www.mojohaus.org/contribution/submitting-a-patch.html)
