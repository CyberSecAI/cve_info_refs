This document describes a security misconfiguration vulnerability (PSV-2017-3120) affecting multiple NETGEAR router models. While it does not specify the exact nature of the misconfiguration, it does state that it has a CVSS v3 score of 8.1. The document provides a list of vulnerable models and firmware versions and urges users to update their firmware to the latest versions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Security misconfiguration in the listed NETGEAR router models. The specific nature of the misconfiguration is not disclosed in this document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A security misconfiguration that can be exploited.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The document classifies the severity as "High" with a CVSS v3 score of 8.1, implying significant potential impact. The CVSS vector indicates that the exploitation results in high confidentiality and integrity impact and low availability impact.
- Confidentiality: High
- Integrity: High
- Availability: Low

**Attack vectors:**
The CVSS vector (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L) suggests a local attack vector (AV:L), implying the attacker requires some level of local access to the device or network. The attacker would require high privileges (PR:H) on the device to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Local access to the device or network, and high privileges.
