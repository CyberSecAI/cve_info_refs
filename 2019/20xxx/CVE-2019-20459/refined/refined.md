[
  {
    "CVE ID": "CVE-2019-20459",
    "Root cause": "The Epson Expression Home XP255 printer's web interface does not implement CSRF protection, which means POST requests do not require anti-CSRF tokens or other mechanisms for validating the request's legitimacy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can exploit the lack of CSRF protection to perform actions on the device via the web interface without the user's knowledge or consent. This can include sending text directly to the RAW printer interface.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker can craft a malicious web page that sends POST requests to the printer's web interface, tricking the user's browser into submitting these requests when the user is authenticated to the printer's web admin panel.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a user who is already authenticated to the printer's web admin panel into visiting the attacker's malicious web page."
