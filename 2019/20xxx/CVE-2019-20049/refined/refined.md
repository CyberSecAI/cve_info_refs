Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-20049 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerable Software:** Alcatel-Lucent OmniVista 4760 (deprecated) and 8770.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) on 4760.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `SaveThemeAction.php` and `SkinAccess.php` files. Specifically, there is a path traversal vulnerability in the `__construct()` function of `SkinAccess.php`, combined with an insecure file upload in the `SetSkinImages()` function. The lack of authentication and permission checks when saving theme edits allows an attacker to bypass the `CompareThemeDate()` check, especially if the `params.st` file is not present in the destination folder.
*   **Weakness:**
    *   Path traversal in `SkinAccess.php::__construct()`.
    *   Unsecured file upload in `SkinAccess.php::SetSkinImages()`.
    *   Missing authentication/authorization checks in `SaveThemeAction.php`.
    *   Insecure session storage in a public directory (/sessions/).
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit the path traversal vulnerability in conjunction with the insecure file upload to upload a malicious PHP file (webshell) to an arbitrary location on the server.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Affected Versions:** Alcatel-Lucent OmniVista 4760.
*   **Exploitability:** The exploit requires no special configuration.

The exploit involves the following steps:

1.  Crafting a POST request to `php-bin/webclient.php` with the `action` parameter set to `saveTheme`.
2.  Setting the `themeId` parameter to a value containing a path traversal sequence (e.g., `"5/../../{}".format(folder)`) to control the upload directory.
3.  Setting the `themeDate` parameter to an empty string to bypass the `CompareThemeDate()` check.
4.  Uploading a malicious PHP file (webshell) via the `BgImg1` parameter.
5.  Accessing the uploaded webshell to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory from Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise states that OmniVista 4760 is deprecated and will not be patched.
*   The exploit code is available on `git.lsd.cat`.
*   The exploit-db entry provides a Python script (`omnivista.py`) that automates the exploitation process.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without authentication.
