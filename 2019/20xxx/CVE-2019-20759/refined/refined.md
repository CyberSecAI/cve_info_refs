The provided document describes a security advisory for a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in NETGEAR R9000 routers.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the NETGEAR R9000 router's firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the router's web interface. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
    - Phishing: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Unauthorized actions: Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Modification of the router's configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code into a field or parameter that is stored and later displayed by the router's web interface. This would likely require an authenticated user (possibly even with limited permissions) to access the vulnerable functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script code via the web interface and then trick another user into viewing this malicious content by accessing the compromised part of the web interface. The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the router. The CVSS vector indicates that user interaction is required, that the attacker does not need special privileges (i.e. a normal user could potentially trigger it), and that the attack is performed adjacent to the router (i.e. someone on the same network, but not necessarily the same device).

The advisory specifies that the affected product is the R9000 router running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.26. NETGEAR recommends updating the firmware to the latest version to mitigate the vulnerability.
