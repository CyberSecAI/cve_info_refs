Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-20455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure practice of disabling SSL certificate verification in the `globalpayments/php-sdk`. Specifically, the code was using `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` options set to `false` or `0`, which disables the verification of the peer's SSL certificate against trusted CAs and hostname verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Defaults:** The SDK was configured to disable SSL certificate verification by default, which is a critical security flaw.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Risk:** Disabling SSL verification makes the application vulnerable to MITM attacks. An attacker could intercept and modify communications between the application and the payment gateway's server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** A successful MITM attack could allow an attacker to steal sensitive information, including payment card data, API keys, and other confidential data transmitted between the SDK and the payment gateway.
- **Tampering with Transactions:** An attacker could potentially alter transaction details or even inject malicious code into the communication stream, leading to financial loss or unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** An attacker positioned within the network path between the client application and the payment gateway server can intercept network traffic.
- **Compromised Network Infrastructure:** Attackers who gain control over network devices or DNS servers can redirect traffic to a malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic, either by being on the same network as the client application or by controlling network infrastructure.
- **Ability to Impersonate the Server:** The attacker must be able to set up a rogue server that impersonates the payment gateway's server, including presenting a valid-looking but fake SSL certificate.

**Additional Details:**
- **Pull Request #8:** The provided content includes a pull request ([#8](https://github.com/globalpayments/php-sdk/pull/8)) that aimed to rectify this issue by removing the insecure `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFY*` options.
- **Intermediate Solution:**  The maintainers of the SDK initially decided against a full version bump to 2.0.0 and instead introduced an intermediate solution that allows developers to supply custom curl options to re-enable the necessary SSL verification.
- **Commit `a73f803`:** This commit in version 2.0.0  enforces SSL certificate validations, as noted, effectively addressing the vulnerability.
- **Version 2.0.0:** The release notes for version 2.0.0 specifically mention the enforcement of SSL certificate validations as a breaking change, implying that previous versions were vulnerable.

In summary, the identified vulnerability is a critical security issue that could expose sensitive financial data to MITM attacks. The content shows how the community identified and began to fix the problem, though the initial fix was not a complete solution and an intermediate solution was used to allow current integrations to work,  until version 2.0.0 addressed the insecure default.
