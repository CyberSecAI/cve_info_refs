| [@oldpec](https://github.com/oldpec) There was a small snag during our deployment today that caused this PR to be merged instead of your PR that removed the explicit cipher list. We were fine with the cipher list removal as-is, but with our current strategy, we felt we would see issues with removing the SSL verification settings in current integrations. We aren't quite ready to issue a full version bump (to 2.0.0), so we implemented an intermediate solution where custom curl options can be supplied with your gateway credentials. Here's a small example of how you can leverage this:  ``` $config = new ServicesConfig(); $config->secretApiKey = 'skapi_cert_MTeSAQAfG1UA9qQDrzl-kz4toXvARyieptFwSKP24w'; $config->serviceUrl = 'https://cert.api2-c.heartlandportico.com/'; $config->curlOptions = [   CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => true,   CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => 2, ]; ServicesContainer::configure($config); ``` |
