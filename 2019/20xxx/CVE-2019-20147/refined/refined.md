Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- When a group is removed from a project membership, it was still possible for group members to see project namespace changes through the Protected Tags API. This indicates a lack of proper access control or insufficient filtering of information exposed by the API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized disclosure of project namespace information through the Protected Tags API. This could reveal project names to users who should no longer have access to the project.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core weakness is the lack of proper access control mechanisms within the Protected Tags API, failing to prevent former group members from accessing project namespace details after the group is removed from project membership.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Exposure of private group/project names to unauthorized users, which could be sensitive.
- **Potential reconnaissance:** Adversaries could use this information to map internal project structures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through the Protected Tags API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Former Group Membership:** An attacker must have previously been a member of a group that had access to the project, even if that access has been revoked.
- **API Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make calls to the Protected Tags API.

**Affected Versions:**
- GitLab EE/CE 9.1 and later.
