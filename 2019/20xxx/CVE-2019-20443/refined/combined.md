# Description:

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WSO2 Identity server. By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies which means that the malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

The following Vulnerability is tested on WSO2 Identity Server version 5.7.0 Product.

**Issue 01: Stored cross site scripting:**

[![Picture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72723224-33546400-3ba6-11ea-932c-b47d28abccc7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72723224-33546400-3ba6-11ea-932c-b47d28abccc7.png)

# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2019-20443 – Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/low.png)

Severity:Low

#### Vendor

##### WSO2

#### Affected Product

##### See Full List Below\*

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20443

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-01-1024

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### January 2, 2020

### Description

This vulnerability was discovered on the WSO2 Identity Server before 5.7.0. A stored cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the applicationÂ and stored in the server. An input variable vulnerable to stored XSS is âmediaTypeâ on the browser page.

**\*Affected Products:** WSO2 API Manager, WSO2 API Manager Analytics, WSO2 Enterprise Integrator, WSO2 IS as Key Manager, WSO2 Identity Server, WSO2 Identity Server Analytics

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on WSO2 Identity Server version 5.7.0 Product.

Issue 01: Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

***Figure 01**: Edit âMedia Typeâ value in the âMetadataâ section.***

***Figure 02:* *Save âMedia Typeâ with XSS payload, â><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>***

***Figure 03:* *Injected XSS payload gets stored to the application.***

***Figure 04:* *Injected XSS Payload gets stored and executed in the browser.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-5(9).png)

***Figure 05:* *The stored XSS payload gets executed in four different places throughout the page whenever the user loads the page.***

### Impact

Through an XSS attack, the attacker can make the browser redirect to a malicious website. Unauthorized actions such as changing the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser are possible. But since all session-related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flat and protected, session hijacking or mounting a similar attack would not be possible.
