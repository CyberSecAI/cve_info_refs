Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20443

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the WSO2 product. Specifically, the `mediaType` variable was not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code injected via the `mediaType` variable gets stored in the application's database/storage. When a user loads the page containing the injected code, the code executes within their browser.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The injected JavaScript code can be executed in the victim's browser.
- **UI Manipulation:** The attacker could change the appearance or functionality of the web page.
- **Information Retrieval:** The attacker could potentially retrieve information from the browser.
- **Redirection:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Session Hijacking (Potentially):** Although the report notes that session-related sensitive cookies are set with `httpOnly` flag and protected, potentially if the `httpOnly` flag is not set, the attacker could steal cookies and hijack a logged in user’s session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attacker injects the malicious XSS payload via the `mediaType` input field within the WSO2 application's admin panel/resource management interface.
- The XSS payload gets stored and executed when other users access the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have valid login credentials to the WSO2 application.
- An attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface where they can modify the `mediaType` variable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on WSO2 Identity Server version 5.7.0.
- The `mediaType` variable is located in the resource metadata editing section accessible via the URL:  `https://192.168.0.138:9444/carbon/resources/update_mediatype_ajaxprocessor.jsp` (local testing IP).
- The XSS payload `“><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>` was used for the proof of concept.
- The injected XSS payload gets executed in multiple locations on the page whenever the user visits the page.
- The vulnerability was reported to WSO2 and subsequently fixed with patches.
- The vulnerability affects multiple WSO2 products including WSO2 API Manager, WSO2 API Manager Analytics, WSO2 Enterprise Integrator, WSO2 IS as Key Manager, WSO2 Identity Server, WSO2 Identity Server Analytics.
- Patches were released to fix the vulnerability in affected WSO2 products and versions.
