This document provides information about a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and gateway models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection. The document doesn't specify the exact vulnerable code or function that causes the injection but confirms it is exploitable after successful login.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the device, which can result in full control, data breaches or denial of service.
**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a network connection to the router's web interface. The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to login.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router, or have access to the web management interface through a port forwarding or similar setup. They also need to have valid user credentials to authenticate and then leverage the command injection vulnerability.

The document provides a list of affected product models and firmware versions, and urges users to update their firmware.
The document provides a CVSS score of 9.8 (High) with vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
This indicates:
- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent Network
