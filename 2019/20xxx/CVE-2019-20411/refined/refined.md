Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:**  The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to potentially forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user. This is specifically exploitable on the Wallboard endpoint which is used to modify wallboard settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can modify Wallboard settings. The specific impact is not detailed beyond modification of wallboard settings, but this could potentially result in:
    *   Displaying misleading information on dashboards.
    *   Disruption of normal usage patterns of the dashboard.
    *   Indirect information disclosure if the modified settings reveal details they were not intended to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could craft a malicious link or website that, when visited by an authenticated user of the vulnerable application, would trigger a request to modify Wallboard settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user of Jira into visiting a malicious link or website.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send the forged request to the vulnerable Jira server, either directly, or through a victim's web browser.
