Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-20050 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the File Manager of Pandora FMS versions 7.42 and earlier. Fixed in 7.43.
*   **Root Cause:** The `mime_content_type` function within `pandora_console/include/functions_filemanager.php` calls the `exec` function unsafely. Specifically, if the PHP Fileinfo extension is disabled, the function uses `exec` with a filename provided by the user, allowing command injection.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input sanitization/validation in the File Manager when creating new directories, combined with reliance on the `exec` function when the Fileinfo extension is unavailable.
*   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated administrator can create a directory with a specially crafted name containing malicious code. Simply browsing to the parent directory of this "tricky" directory triggers the RCE.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Admin account access to the Pandora FMS File Manager.
    *   The PHP Fileinfo extension must be disabled on the server.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running Pandora FMS, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    1.  Disable the PHP fileinfo extension.
    2.  Log into Pandora FMS as an administrator.
    3.  Navigate to the File Manager.
    4.  Create a new directory with a name crafted to inject a command, such as `test;\`echo -n "COMMAND" | base64 -d\``.  The command will be base64 encoded.
    5.  Navigate to the parent directory of the newly created directory. This will trigger the `exec` function and execute the injected command.

The provided content includes a helper script to generate the base64 encoded reverse shell payload and start a netcat listener.
