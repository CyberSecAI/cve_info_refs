In fact, in CaaSP 4.0 module we do not ship neither nginx neither nginx-ingress-controller.  I just see a beta image from very early stages of CaaSP 4 here:  * registry.suse.de/suse/containers/suse-caasp/4/containers/caasp/v4/nginx-ingress-controller:beta1 (dated from 1st of March of 2019)  I can't see ingress-controller published in anywhere else than the CaaSP 3.0 container image and really early internal betas of CaaSP v4.  So I don't think this bug applies to CaaSP 4 in any way. We are not providing any nginx image too. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1160682#c13)  Klaus Kämpf   2020-02-10 13:48:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to David Cassany from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1160682#c12)) >  > I can't see ingress-controller published in anywhere else than the CaaSP 3.0 > container image and really early internal betas of CaaSP v4.

The docs <https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.1/single-html/caasp-admin/#nginx-ingress> refer to the helm chart, which refers to the CaaSPv3 image  <https://github.com/SUSE/kubernetes-charts-suse-com/blob/master/stable/nginx-ingress/values.yaml#L7>  IIRC Michal Rostecki helped building the nginx package.

Damn, you are right, sorry I missed that part. I assumed all CaaSP 4.0 binaries were tight to CaaSP v4 projects in IBS, this is the exception. I did not realize that there was this helm chart pulling images from v3.   @Jordi we should make it obvious some how... probably as we did with Terraform that we included a link in our Devel pointing to the relevant project, at least this way you'd see the image and ingress-controller listed somewhere under Devel:CaaSP:4.0 pointing to the right location.  Then, yes we are affected by this issue. I am having a look to the nginx from CaaSP v3 (the included within the image) and it's related image. Hopefully the patch provided for the SLE-15-SP1 is easy to apply in CaaSPv3 (looks like a minimalist patch). ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1160682#c17)  David Cassany   2020-02-11 10:12:25 UTC  ``` I just verified the patch provided for nginx to SLE-15-SP1 applies clean to the nignx version we have in CaaSPv3. After having a look the provided links and information (thanks Alexandros for that), I believe the nginx patch is a must and that we should also evaluate the suggested workaround for ingress-controller in:  <https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/4859>  Up to my understading the above is a workaround to mitigate the nginx vulnerability, thus IMHO makes sense to also include it.  @Michal would it be feasible to apply the above patch in nginx-ingress-controller from SUSE:SLE-12-SP3:Update:Products:CASP30:Update? I created a branch with the related packages in home:dcassany:ingress-controller (I already patched nginx there) I added you as a maintainer too. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1160682#c18)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-02-11 23:14:19 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0204-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
