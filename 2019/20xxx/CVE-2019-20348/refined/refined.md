{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper access control on the UART serial interface of OKER G232V1 devices.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The UART interface provides a root terminal without proper authentication or access control.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers with physical access can interrupt the boot sequence, execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, potentially leading to information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, and the ability to plant backdoors.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack requires physical access to the device's UART hardware. The attacker needs to identify the UART channel (Tx, Rx, GND) to gain access to the console.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have physical access to the device and basic knowledge to interface with a UART serial connection."
