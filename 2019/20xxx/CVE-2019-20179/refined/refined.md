Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the SO Planning software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `by` parameter within the `/user_list.php` resource, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or corrupt data stored in the database.
*   **Data Deletion:** Attackers can potentially delete the entire database or specific data within it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerable parameter is exposed through HTTP POST requests to `/user_list.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`by`) and the associated resource (`/user_list.php`).
*   **SQL Injection Skills:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.
*   **High Privileges:** According to the CVSS vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), high privileges (PR:H) are needed.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Vulnerable Software:** SO Planning version 1.45 and possibly earlier versions are vulnerable.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided content includes a proof-of-concept demonstrating how a `sleep` SQL command can be used to verify the vulnerability using BurpSuite and SQLmap.
*   **CVSS Vector:** The provided CVSS v3.1 vector is `AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
