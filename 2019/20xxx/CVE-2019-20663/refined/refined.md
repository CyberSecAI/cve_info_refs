The provided content discusses a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified by NETGEAR as PSV-2018-0559, affecting specific NETGEAR Orbi WiFi systems. It does not mention CVE-2019-20663, thus the content is likely unrelated. However, the advisory provides detailed information about the XSS vulnerability which can be extracted:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the NETGEAR Orbi product line.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that malicious script can be injected into the device's storage and then executed when a user interacts with the affected functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session while interacting with the affected Netgear device's web interface. This could result in:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Theft of sensitive data
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected NETGEAR devices (RBR50, RBS50, RBK50). An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious scripts which will then be stored.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to inject the malicious script which would then be stored. The exact method of injection is not detailed in this advisory. The CVSS vector provides more details:
    - `AV:L` -  Local attack vector - implies the attacker requires local access to the device in some way
    - `PR:H` - High privleges - implies the attacker needs administrative privileges to perform the injection, or exploit an authenticated endpoint.
    - `UI:N` - No user interaction - implies the user would not need to interact with any prompts for the exploit to succeed.

**Affected Products:**
- NETGEAR Orbi product models: RBR50, RBS50, RBK50 with firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30.

**Mitigation:**
- The advisory recommends updating the firmware to version 2.3.5.30 or later.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory provides a CVSS v3 score of 6.0 with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`. This indicates a Medium severity vulnerability exploitable via local access with administrative privileges. The impact includes High confidentiality and integrity compromise, and No availability compromise.
