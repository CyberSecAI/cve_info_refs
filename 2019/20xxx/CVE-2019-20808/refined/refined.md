**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20808

**Official Description:** The provided documents are from NetApp and do not include the official CVE description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `ati_cursor_define()` function within the ATI VGA emulation component of QEMU version 4.1.0. This flaw is triggered during the handling of MMIO write operations through the `ati_mm_write()` callback.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Out-of-bounds read in the `ati_cursor_define()` function within the ATI VGA emulation of QEMU

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the QEMU process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious guest operating system running within a virtualized environment could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code within a guest operating system running on a NetApp product that uses the vulnerable QEMU version.
- The attacker needs to trigger the specific MMIO write operations.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in QEMU version 4.1.0.
- NetApp products that incorporate the vulnerable QEMU version are affected. However, the NetApp advisory states that none of their products are actually affected by this issue due to not having the vulnerable QEMU version incorporated.
- A commit in the QEMU repository addresses the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.5 (MEDIUM) with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
