Package        : libyang
Version        : 0.16.105+really1.0-0+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-20391 CVE-2019-20392 CVE-2019-20393 CVE-2019-20394
                 CVE-2019-20395 CVE-2019-20396 CVE-2019-20397 CVE-2019-20398

Multiple flaws were found in libyang, a parser toolkit for IETF YANG data
modeling. Double frees, invalid memory access and Null pointer dereferences
may cause a denial of service or potentially code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.16.105+really1.0-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libyang packages.

For the detailed security status of libyang please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libyang>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Segmentation fault when if-feature is used in list key node, with a non existing feature #723

## Description

![@jvijtiuk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30860583?v=4&size=48)[jvijtiuk](https://github.com/jvijtiuk)opened [on Mar 7, 2019](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/723#issue-418474100)

If an if-feature statement is used inside a list key node, and the feature used is not defined, yanglint and yangfuzz segfault in lys\_parse\_path.

Here is an example of a yang file that crashes the parser:

```
module links {
  namespace "urn:module2";
  prefix mod2;

  list list-for-augment {
    key "keyleaf";

    leaf keyleaf {
      if-feature foo;
      type string;
    }

    leaf test {
      type string;
    }
  }
}

```
