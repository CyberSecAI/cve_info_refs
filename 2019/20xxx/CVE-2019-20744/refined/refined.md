Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document mentions a "sensitive information disclosure security vulnerability" but does not specify the exact nature of the vulnerability, other than it involves the WAC510 access point.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a sensitive information disclosure. The specific vulnerability is not described.

**Impact of exploitation:** The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information. The exact sensitive information is not mentioned.

**Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N` indicates:
  - Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent (A). An attacker must be within the same network or link layer.
  - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L). No special conditions for exploitation.
  - Privileges Required (PR): High (H). The attacker requires high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
  - User Interaction (UI): None (N). No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
  - Scope (S): Unchanged (U). The vulnerability's impact is limited to the affected component.
  - Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H). There is a high impact on the confidentiality of data.
  - Integrity Impact (I): High (H). There is a high impact on the integrity of data.
  - Availability Impact (A): None (N). There is no impact on the availability of the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same network segment and have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document does not explicitly state what sensitive information is disclosed, but it implies it could have a significant impact given the high confidentiality and integrity impacts.
- The vulnerability is specific to the WAC510 model with firmware versions prior to 5.0.10.2.
- The document states that the vulnerability remains if the firmware is not updated.
- The advisory was published on 2019-05-30.
