- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing function level access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device does not properly restrict access to certain functions, allowing unauthorized users to potentially perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or disruption of the device's operations, potentially resulting in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The advisory states that the attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device (adjacent). No special privileges are mentioned as being required.
