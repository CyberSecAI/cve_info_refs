Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `update_lan_state` function of the ASUS router firmware. This function copies the values of `lan_dns1_x` and `lan_dns2_x` from NVRAM to a local buffer with a fixed size of 100 bytes without performing any length checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of input validation when copying data from NVRAM to a local buffer. This allows an attacker to overwrite memory beyond the buffer's boundaries.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `Advanced_LAN_Content.asp` page does not properly sanitize the input for the `lan_dns1_x` and `lan_dns2_x` fields. Although initially there is a `maxlength` of 126 character on the page, it can be bypassed by removing that restriction. This allows an attacker to insert an arbitrary long string into the configuration.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication, as the vulnerable page does not enforce authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow data, an attacker could overwrite the return address or other critical data on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the router.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the buffer overflow could cause the router to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete control over the affected router.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/start_apply.htm` endpoint.
- **Manipulated Parameters:** The malicious payload is included in the `lan_dns1_x` and `lan_dns2_x` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router to send the HTTP POST request.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any login credentials or authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Modify HTTP Request:** The attacker must be able to modify the HTTP request to include a large payload for `lan_dns1_x` or `lan_dns2_x`

**Additional details from provided content:**
- The `Advanced_LAN_Content.asp` page contains the vulnerable input fields.
- The `sub_41ee90` and `sub_41e69c` functions in the httpd daemon are involved in saving the parameters to NVRAM.
- The `update_lan_state` function, called by the `init` process when reloading the system, is where the overflow occurs.
- The provided PoC script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP POST request with an oversized `lan_dns1_x` parameter.
- The vulnerability was discovered by pr0v3rbs@kaist.ac.kr, and the exploit author was also pr0v3rbs@kaist.ac.kr.
- The vulnerability affects ASUS RT-N53 routers, at least with firmware version 3.0.0.4.376.3754.
