- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `setup-datasource-standard.jsp` page before rendering it in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present due to insufficient input sanitization.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the website

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vectors are the following POST parameters in the `/setup/setup-datasource-standard.jsp` page:
   - `driver`
   - `password`
   - `serverURL`
   - `username`

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `/setup/setup-datasource-standard.jsp` page with malicious JavaScript injected into the mentioned parameters. The user must then interact with the crafted page. Since the vulnerability is present in the setup process, initial exposure might be limited.
