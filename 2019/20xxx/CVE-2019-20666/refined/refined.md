The provided content is related to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but it is not associated with CVE-2019-20666. The advisory is for NETGEAR products and is identified as PSV-2018-0555.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the web interface of certain NETGEAR WiFi systems.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored XSS vulnerability, where malicious scripts can be stored on the device and executed when a user interacts with the affected part of the interface.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to actions like session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites, potentially compromising the device and other connected devices.
*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to inject malicious script into a stored part of the web interface which is then viewed by an administrative user. This suggests that the attacker likely needs some form of administrative access to inject the script or otherwise needs to trick an administrative user into injecting the script for them. The exploit does not require direct user interaction.

**Affected Devices and Firmware Versions:**

*   RBR50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBS50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   RBK50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30

*  CVSS v3 Rating: Medium
*  CVSS v3 Score: 6
*  Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
    *   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local) indicates the attacker needs to have local access to the device.
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low) indicates that the attack is easily performed.
    *   **PR:H** (Privileges Required: High) indicates that the attacker needs to have administrative privileges to perform the attack.
    *   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None) indicates that no user interaction is required to perform the attack.
    *   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged) indicates that the scope of the vulnerability is limited to the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H** (Confidentiality: High) indicates a high impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:H** (Integrity: High) indicates a high impact on integrity.
    *   **A:N** (Availability: None) indicates that there is no impact on availability.
