Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20438

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the inline API documentation editor page of the WSO2 API Manager. Specifically, the application allows users to input arbitrary code via the code view of the editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious scripts injected into the documentation editor are stored and executed whenever a user views the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Website Redirects:** An attacker can redirect a user's browser to a malicious website.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform unauthorized actions such as modifying the webpage UI or extracting information from the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking (Mitigated):** While the content mentions session hijacking, it also notes that sensitive cookies are protected with `httpOnly` flags, mitigating the risk of session hijacking or similar attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the WSO2 API Manager's web interface, specifically the inline API documentation editor.
- **Code Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript payload into the code view of the documentation editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the WSO2 API Manager to access and modify the documentation editor.
- **Access to API Publisher:** The attacker needs access to the API Publisher module where the inline documentation editor is available.
