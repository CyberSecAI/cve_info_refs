# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2019-20438 – Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/low.png)

Severity:Low

#### Vendor

##### WSO2

#### Affected Product

##### WSO2 API Manager

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20438

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-01-1020

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### July 6, 2019

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered on WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0 in the inline API documentation editor page of the API Publisher. A stored cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the inline API documentation editor page of the API Publisher when the user uses XSS payload in the code view.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on the WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0 Product.

Issue 01: Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-1(13).png)***

***Figure 01:* *Choose âEdit Contentâ after creating a document.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-2(12).png)

***Figure 02:* *Clicked on </> to add XSS payload.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-3(10).png)

***Figure 03:* *Use the âSaveâ button to save the document with the added âXSS Payload.â***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-4(9).png)

***Figure 04:* *Saving and clicking on </> back stores the XSS payload and executes in the browser.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-5(5).png)

***Figure 05:* *The stored XSS payload gets executed whenever the user loads the page.***

### Impact

Through an XSS attack, the attacker can make the browser redirect to a malicious website. Unauthorized actions such as changing the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser are possible. But since all session-related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flat and protected, session hijacking or mounting a similar attack would not be possible.

### Remediations

Download the relevant patch based on the product version.

| **Code** | **Product** | **Version** | **Patch** |
