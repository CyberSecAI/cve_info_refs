The provided content relates to CVE-2019-20358.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of insecure DLL loading, insecure execution of batch scripts, and insecure permissions on the temporary directory created by the self-extracting executable of the Trend Micro Anti-Threat Toolkit (ATTK).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **DLL Preloading Vulnerability:** The self-extracting executables load DLLs from their "application directory" (typically the user's "Downloads" folder) instead of the Windows system directory. This allows an attacker to place malicious DLLs in the same directory as the executable, which will then be loaded and executed by the Trend Micro ATTK application.
2.  **Insecure Batch Script Execution:** The batch script `batCollector.bat`, which is part of the ATTK, executes `findstr` and `REG` commands without specifying the full path, causing it to execute those utilities from its current working directory. This allows an attacker to replace these standard utilities with malicious versions.
3.  **Insecure Permissions on Temporary Directory:** The self-extractors fail to restrict write access to the temporary directory they create. This means that unprivileged users can add malicious files or modify the batch script before its execution by the toolkit.
4. **Outdated Libraries**: The toolkit uses outdated and vulnerable libraries like Visual Studio 2008, LIBCMT, cURL 7.48 and libeay32.dll 1.0.1.17 (OpenSSL 1.0.1).

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to achieve:
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By planting malicious DLLs or executables, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ATTK.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** Through the batch script vulnerability, an attacker can gain administrative privileges by placing malicious `findstr.com/findstr.exe/findstr.bat/findstr.cmd` and/or `REG.com/REG.exe/REG.bat/REG.cmd` files in the unprotected directory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By replacing the DLLs with faulty ones, the application can be made to crash.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **DLL Preloading:**
    *   An attacker places malicious DLLs (e.g., `VERSION.dll`, `IPHLPAPI.dll`) in the same directory where the victim downloads and executes the Trend Micro ATTK self-extracting executable.
    *   The victim runs the legitimate ATTK executable, which inadvertently loads and executes the attacker's malicious DLLs.

2.  **Insecure Batch Script Execution:**
    *   An attacker places malicious `findstr.com/findstr.exe/findstr.bat/findstr.cmd` or `REG.com/REG.exe/REG.bat/REG.cmd` files in the `TrendMicro AntiThreat Toolkit\HC_ATTK` directory.
    *   When the ATTK runs the `batCollector.bat` script, it will execute the malicious files instead of the legitimate system tools.

3.  **Insecure Permissions:**
    *   An attacker modifies or replaces the `batCollector.bat` script or places malicious executables in the `TrendMicro AntiThreat Toolkit\HC_ATTK` directory due to insufficient permission restrictions on the directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **User interaction:** The victim needs to download and execute the Trend Micro ATTK self-extracting executable.
*   **File system write access:** The attacker must be able to write files in the directory where the ATTK executable is downloaded (typically the Downloads folder) or in the temporary directory created by the self-extractor.
* **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable toolkit is executed, either through malicious downloads, or access to the file system.
