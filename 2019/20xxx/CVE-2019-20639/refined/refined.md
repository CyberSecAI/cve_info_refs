This document discusses a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Netgear Orbi WiFi systems, specifically models RBR50, RBS50 and RBK50.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface that are then executed by other users who access the affected page/area.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they access the web interface of the router. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions depending on the attacker's objective and the privileges of the user being targeted.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious javascript into the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need a way to inject malicious script into the web interface, and the user would have to access the vulnerable section of the web interface while logged in.  The specific method of injection is not detailed in the advisory.  The advisory does state the CVSS vector has a user interaction of none, but a high level of access is required to inject the script.
