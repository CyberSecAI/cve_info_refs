The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. While the advisory does not mention CVE-2019-20738, it does detail the vulnerability, affected products, and remediation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the web interface of various Netgear routers, gateways, and WiFi systems. This occurs because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being stored and displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability, allowing injection of malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected devices.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser when they access the device's management interface. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking,
*   Credential theft,
*   Manipulation of the device's settings,
*   Redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to inject the malicious JavaScript code, likely via a vulnerable form field within the device's web interface, which will then be stored and displayed to other users when they access the same interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs access to the device's web interface to inject the malicious code. This could be via an authenticated user with admin access, or potentially through another vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated injection.
*  The attacker would also need to know the device has a vulnerable firmware version.
* An attack would require a victim to access the device web interface.
