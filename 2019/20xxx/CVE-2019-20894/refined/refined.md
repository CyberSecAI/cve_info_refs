Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is that Traefik skips the mutual TLS (mTLS) verification for established connections when using the Kubernetes CRD provider. This means that after a successful connection to a service that doesn't require mTLS, subsequent requests to a service that *does* require mTLS may bypass the certificate check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inconsistent mTLS Enforcement:**  Traefik fails to consistently enforce mTLS requirements, allowing connections to services requiring client certificates even when no valid certificate is presented.
- **Bypass of Security Controls:** This behavior bypasses the intended security control of client certificate authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can potentially access services protected by mTLS without possessing the required client certificates, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- **Data Exposure:**  If these services handle sensitive data, this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized data exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can establish an initial connection to a service that does not require mTLS within the same Traefik instance. Then, within the same established TCP connection/session, they can attempt to access an mTLS protected service.
- The attack is browser based as the browser maintains the session and reuses existing connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate network connections to the Traefik instance.
- The attacker does not need valid client certificates if they have previously connected to a non-mTLS service.
- The attacker needs to know the hostnames for the non-mTLS and mTLS protected services.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is present in Traefik versions 2.0.0-rc1 and 2.0.0-rc2.
- The provided configuration uses the Kubernetes CRD provider.
- The user identified the behavior through a specific test case:
  - Successfully connecting to a service that does not require client certificates (`without-mtls.example.com`).
  - Subsequently accessing a service that does require client certificates (`meow.example.com`) within the same browser session, without being prompted for or requiring a client certificate.
- The expected behavior is that when accessing `meow.example.com` without proper client certs the browser should return ERR\_BAD\_SSL\_CLIENT\_AUTH\_CERT, or the server would close the connection.
