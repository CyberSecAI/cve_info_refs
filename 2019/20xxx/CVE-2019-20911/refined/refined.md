The provided content relates to CVE-2019-20911.

Based on the information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
- The issue arises from how the LibreDWG library handles unknown object and entity types within DWG files. Specifically, the code had a flaw related to managing a `tio.unknown` member of the `Dwg_Object` structure. The `unknown` field was meant to store raw bits of unhandled classes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:** Multiple heap overflows were present, triggered by the way unhandled class data was read and stored.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code contained instances where NULL pointers were dereferenced, likely when processing malformed or unexpected data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A DoS condition could be triggered, possibly due to excessive resource consumption or program crashes when parsing crafted DWG files.
- **Stack Overflow:** A stack overflow vulnerability was present, causing a memory leak on the master branch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The identified vulnerabilities can lead to program crashes, memory corruption, and potential arbitrary code execution.
- An attacker can craft malicious DWG files to trigger these flaws, leading to program instability and potential compromise of systems utilizing the LibreDWG library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted DWG files.
- An attacker would need to create a DWG file that contains specific combinations of malformed or unexpected data, which then triggers vulnerabilities during the parsing process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to provide a specially crafted DWG file to an application using the vulnerable LibreDWG library.
- The attacker does not require privileged access to the system but needs to be able to initiate the parsing of the malicious DWG file.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported on the master branch and version 0.9.3 of the LibreDWG library.
- The vulnerabilities were discovered using AddressSanitizer (ASAN) during fuzzing.
- The identified vulnerabilities include 3 heap overflows, 2 NULL pointer dereferences, 1 denial of service, and 1 stack overflow.
- The patch addresses the vulnerabilities by removing the `tio.unknown` member, which was the root cause of the issues.
- The commit message associated with the fix indicates that the `tio.unknown` was no longer needed due to changes in how the `UNKNOWN_OBJ` or `UNKNOWN_ENT` types are handled. The fix targets the heap overflow #2 mentioned in issue #178.
