Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20336:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content explicitly mentions `CVE-ID :- CVE-2019-20336` and identifies it as a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the "Advanced Real Estate Script Version 4.0.9" by PHP Scripts Mall.
   - This aligns with the provided CVE ID.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the `search-results.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the `searchtext` parameter.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
     - Session hijacking
     - Defacement of the website
     - Phishing attacks
     - Redirection to malicious websites
     - Information theft

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious script in the `searchtext` parameter of the `search-results.php` page.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it. No special access to the system is needed other than the ability to send the URL to a victim.

**Technical details from the content:**
   - The vulnerable URL is provided:
     `http://thavasu.com/demo/advance-realestate/search-results.php?Projectmain=&proj_type=&searchtext=mad">-->"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`
     - This URL injects a javascript `alert()` that displays the document's domain, demonstrating the ability to execute javascript.

**Summary:** The content provides a clear proof of concept for a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Advanced Real Estate Script. An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious URL, which, when visited by a user, executes arbitrary javascript.
