This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1581264#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2018-05-22 12:35:40 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1581262,1581264  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1581264#c2)  Ben Cotton    2019-05-02 21:43:18 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 28 is nearing its end of life. On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1581264#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-01-24 22:58:13 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-20cf0743f5 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-20cf0743f5>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1581264#c4)  Fedora Update System    2020-01-24 22:58:14 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2020-da06eb1ffa has been submitted as an update to Fedora EPEL 8. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2020-da06eb1ffa>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1581264#c5)  Fedora Update System    2020-01-24 22:58:16 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-67590fbf08 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-67590fbf08>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1581264#c6)  Fedora Update System    2020-01-24 22:58:17 UTC  ``` FEDORA-EPEL-2020-6d47c64c04 has been submitted as an update to Fedora EPEL 7. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2020-6d47c64c04>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1581264#c7)  Fedora Update System    2020-01-26 01:14:33 UTC  ``` upx-3.96-1.el8 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 8 testing repository.
