- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability exists in the web interface of the affected devices.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface which are then executed in the browsers of other users who access the interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface. The attacker would need to inject malicious code into a field that is later displayed to other users of the router interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into the system. The CVSS vector shows that the attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) to exploit the vulnerability, likely implying that admin access to the router is required for injection.
