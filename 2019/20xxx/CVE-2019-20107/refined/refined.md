The provided content relates to CVE-2019-20107. This CVE involves multiple commits that address the same vulnerability by sanitizing user input in various files of the TestLink application.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided commit details:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically request parameters such as `$_REQUEST['requirement_id']`, `$_REQUEST['left_item_id']`, `$_REQUEST['right_item_id']`, `$_REQUEST['tproject_id']`, `$_REQUEST['tplan_id']`, `$_REQUEST['tcase_id']`, `$_REQUEST['tcversion_id']`, `$_REQUEST['req_spec_id']`, `$_REQUEST['build_id']`, `$_REQUEST['id']`, and others. These parameters are directly used in database queries, potentially leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code through the vulnerable request parameters, an attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code directly uses user input without validating or sanitizing it. This allows an attacker to control the data used in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored in the TestLink database.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could manipulate or delete data, potentially corrupting the application's data integrity or causing a denial-of-service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities could lead to privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain administrative access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through HTTP requests containing maliciously crafted parameters.
- The attacker would need to have access to the TestLink application and be able to send HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have network access to the TestLink application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as some parameters seem to be used before an authentication process.

**Commit Details and Fixes:**

The provided content contains multiple commits that address the vulnerability by converting vulnerable parameters to integers using `intval()`. This effectively sanitizes the input by removing any non-numeric characters, preventing SQL injection through these parameters.

Here's a summary of the affected files and their fixes:

1.  **`lib/requirements/reqCompareVersions.php`**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Parameters `$_REQUEST['requirement_id']`, `$_REQUEST['left_item_id']`, `$_REQUEST['right_item_id']`, and `$_SESSION['testprojectID']` are not sanitized before being used.
    -   **Fix:** The commit `146b4f38010a48c36b7d9650060ca354c92ab4ac` converts these parameters to integers using `intval()`.

2.  **`lib/testcases/tcAssign2Tplan.php`**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Parameters `$_REQUEST['tplan_id']`, `$_REQUEST['tproject_id']`, `$_REQUEST['tcase_id']`, and `$_REQUEST['tcversion_id']` are not sanitized.
    -  **Fix:** The commit `d27690c6cb7708a6db0701b6428381d32d51495a` converts these parameters to integers using `intval()`.

3.  **`lib/requirements/reqSpecCompareRevisions.php`**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Parameters `$_REQUEST['req_spec_id']`, `$_REQUEST['left_item_id']`, `$_REQUEST['right_item_id']`, and `$_SESSION['testprojectID']` are not sanitized.
    -   **Fix:** The commit `bcf7b971b5c88ea08d2dc47685f319be3b02cea8` converts these parameters to integers using `intval()`.

4.  **`lib/plan/newest_tcversions.php`**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Parameter `$_SESSION['testprojectID']` and `$_REQUEST['tplan_id']` are not sanitized.
    -   **Fix:** The commit `942c406fcee5d376235a264cb8a79300a0002d20` converts these parameters to integers using `intval()`.

5.   **`lib/plan/planUpdateTC.php`**
     -   **Vulnerability:** Parameter `$_REQUEST['id']` is not sanitized.
     -   **Fix:** The commit `942c406fcee5d376235a264cb8a79300a0002d20` converts this parameter to an integer using `intval()`.

6.   **`lib/plan/tc_exec_unassign_all.php`**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Parameters `$_REQUEST['build_id']` and `$_SESSION['testprojectID']` are not sanitized.
    -   **Fix:** The commit `e2d88c9d7f8e02640ba65e5ff74b55d0399a53d0` converts these parameters to integers using `intval()`.

7.   **`lib/results/testCasesWithCF.php`**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Parameters `$_SESSION['testprojectID']` and `$_REQUEST['tplan_id']` are not sanitized.
    -   **Fix:** The commit `e2d88c9d7f8e02640ba65e5ff74b55d0399a53d0` converts these parameters to integers using `intval()`.

8. **`lib/testcases/tcCompareVersions.php`**
    -   **Vulnerability:** Parameter `$_REQUEST['testcase_id']` is not sanitized
    -   **Fix:** The commit `7647a7b53ceab31524cfcfb3beb8435af0a30fc1` converts this parameter to an integer using `intval()`.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit messages consistently refer to "fix: security #8829", indicating these changes are related to the same security issue.
- The changes involve adding `intval()` around `$_REQUEST` and `$_SESSION` parameters that are expected to be integers.

In conclusion, CVE-2019-20107 is a vulnerability in the TestLink application that arises from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code by manipulating HTTP request parameters. The identified commits address this issue by sanitizing the vulnerable parameters using `intval()`, thus preventing potential SQL injection attacks.
