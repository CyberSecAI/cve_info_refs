Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `ilst_item_Read()` function located in `isomedia/box_code_apple.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to access a memory location through a pointer that is NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a crash of the application (MP4Box), causing a denial of service. This can prevent users from processing or analyzing the crafted MP4 file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted MP4 File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file. Specifically, the malformed data within the `ilst` box appears to cause the issue.
*   **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is exposed during the parsing of MP4 files, specifically while processing the `ilst` (item list) box.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious MP4 file:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application, either through direct file input or by tricking a user to open the file with the vulnerable software.
*   **No authentication is needed** to trigger the issue, since it is related to file parsing.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided github issue includes a PoC (Proof of Concept) file that triggers the crash.
*   The issue was discovered through fuzzing with AFL based fuzzer.
*   The vulnerability was still present in versions 0.8.0 and 0.9.0 of the software after the initial discovery.
*   The AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output confirms the NULL pointer dereference, providing specific file and line number, along with the call stack at the time of the crash.
