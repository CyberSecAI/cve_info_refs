Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way ABBYY FineReader's licensing service handles the creation and renaming of temporary files. Specifically, when the `Licensing.cnt` file is missing, the service creates a temporary file with a predictable name (`tmpXXXX_YYYYYYYYY.tmp`), writes data to it, and then renames it to `Licensing.cnt`. The predictable nature of the temporary file's name and the service's behavior allows a local attacker to manipulate the file creation process using symlinks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Temporary File Names:** The service generates temporary file names with a predictable pattern, making it possible to anticipate the file name.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The service’s temporary file creation and renaming process is vulnerable to manipulation via symlinks.
*   **Lack of Privilege Checks:** The service does not properly validate or restrict file operations, allowing symlink redirection to arbitrary locations.
*   **NTFS Reparse Points:** Exploits the ability to create NTFS reparse points to redirect file system operations to other locations.
*   **Symlink Creation:** Exploits the ability to create symlinks without administrative rights by using the "\RPC Control\" object directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate privileges from a standard user to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By manipulating the symlinks, the attacker can cause the service to overwrite any file on the system with arbitrary content.
*   **System Compromise:** Overwriting system files or DLLs can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System Manipulation:** The attack requires the ability to create directories, files, and symlinks on the local file system.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to remove the `Licensing.cnt` file and then create symlinks at specific times before the service attempts to recreate it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the system where ABBYY FineReader is installed.
*   **File System Permissions:** The attacker needs to have write access to the `C:\ProgramData\ABBYY\FineReader\15\Licenses` directory and the ability to create symlinks.
*   **Precise Timing:** The attacker must be able to accurately predict the timestamp for when the licensing service creates a temporary file.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to SYSTEM by manipulating the ABBYY FineReader licensing service’s temporary file creation process via symlinks. The attacker exploits the predictable nature of temporary file creation, insecure file handling and the lack of proper privilege checks. This results in arbitrary file write capability leading to a complete system compromise.
