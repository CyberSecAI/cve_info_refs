New functionality

1. Import from an SFTP server

An SFTP server can be used to send documents to the ABBYY FlexiCapture-based cloud service over a secure
connection.  It  can  be  also  used  with  a  common  FlexiCapture  installation.  Documents  are  imported  into
ABBYY FlexiCapture automatically, making all the Hot Folder capabilities available to the ABBYY FlexiCapture-
based cloud service.

To use the SFTP import feature, follow these steps:

1.  Select Hot Folder for the import source.
2.  Select SFTP server for the Hot Folder type. Specify the address of your SFTP server. If you are using

a non-standard port, specify it after the server address (e.g. sftp://address:port/).

3.  Click the Settings... button and enter your login and password in the Network Settings dialog box.
4.  Make sure the following permissions are given to the SFTP server:
a.  File permissions: Download, Upload, and Delete
b.  Directory permissions: List, Create, and Delete

Page 3 of 10

Note: Only password-based authentication is allowed.

2.  Export to JSON

Starting from this release, JSON can be selected as a file saving format when exporting data to a file.
You can:

  Specify additional data to be exported (e.g. field locations, errors, or recognition quality data).
  Select the Preserve value type on export option to save an XML schema with field type descriptions.
  Select an encoding (see the “Export file formats” section).
  Specify field names, if necessary. To do this, click Field Mapping and, in the Field Mapping dialog

box that opens, specify the field names.

Known limitation: Decimal values will be enclosed in quotation marks (e.g. "14.25").

3.  ABBYY  FlexiCapture  for  Invoices:  Purchase  Order

Number field extraction is improved

In  ABBYY  FlexiCapture  12  Release  3  and  earlier,  Purchase  Order  Numbers  could  only  be  extracted  using
databases or regular expressions. Now PO numbers are extracted using neural networks and such extraction
is enabled by default.

Extraction based on neural networks is supplementary to other methods so it will work in case PO number
was not extracted with other methods such as database lookup or search using regular expression.

The quality of extraction out-of-the-box was measured on testing batches with normal quality of images for
OCR:

If for some reason you need to disable Purchase Order Number extraction based on neural networks add
the register key and set a value as described:

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ABBYY\FlexiCapture\12.0\DAForms]

EnableNeuralNetPONumber = false

Page 4 of 10

4.  ABBYY  FlexiCapture  for  Invoices:  extraction  of  BU

name and Vendor name based on neural networks
Neural Network is also trained to extract Vendor name and BU name. This extraction will work in both cases:
no  vendor  or  BU  databases  are  connected,  or  databases  are  connected  but  database  lookup  was  not
successful.

5.  ABBYY  FlexiCapture  for  Invoices:  Purchase  Order

number extraction trained on the user’s side

Extraction of Purchase Order Numbers can now be trained on the user’s side. For several Purchase Order
Numbers in one document, only the first instance will be used for training.

In fact, another non-repeatable field is trained because of the restriction to train repeatable group. Then the
value is automatically copied back to the instance of the group. That is why for new invoice projects, training
of PO number will be enabled by default but when using an invoice project created in an earlier version,
additional adjustments should be done. After project update to the new version, please follow these steps:

1.  Open your project in ABBYY FlexiCapture 12 Release 3 Update 1. Your project will be updated.
2.  Open the Document Definition Properties dialog box, click the Invoice Settings tab, and make sure

that the following options are selected:

3.  Purchase order matching
4.  Thorough extraction of invoice header fields
5.  On the Event Handler tab, select After document state changed.
6.  For the TrainablePO group of fields, select the Copy PO data to TrainablePO rule.
7.  Check  the  recognition  setting  of  fields  from  TrainablePO group  and  if  they  have  Do  not

recognize setting on Recognition tab, change it to Standard Recognition.

8.  Start training PO number extraction.

6.  ABBYY FlexiCapture for Invoices: improved detection of

line items

In case of multi-line product or service descriptions, a line item could be incorrectly separated into several
lines. Extraction of such line items has been improved so now the program interpret them like single line
item with long description. Please note that the extraction of multi-line description of the last LineItem on
the page may fail.

If you need to extract a lot of multi-line description, the mode of extraction of LineItems can be changed
using registry key:

[Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ABBYY\FlexiCapture\12.0\DAForms]

"EnableExtendingDescriptionInLineItems" = true

7.  Updated EULA

The  EULA  has  been  updated.  Besides  English,  the  EULA  is  now  available  in  Russian,  Japanese,  German,
French, and Spanish.

8.  Web Verification UI translated into Traditional Chinese
The  UI  of  the  Web  Verification,  Web  Scanning  and  Web  Capture  stations  is  now  available  in  Traditional
Chinese.

9.  Help of Scanning Station is translated into German and

French

Help file for Scanning Station is available now on German and French.

10.

Ability to crop and split images during verification

When multiple documents were scanned together (e.g. when scanning IDs or receipts), it was only possible
to split the resulting image on the Scanning Station. Autocrop was only available on the Scanning Station or
via an image enhancement profile. Now Automatic crop, Split and manual Crop tools are also available to
verification operators. They can use corresponding buttons on the toolbar:

Splitting receipts scanned on the same page:

11.

Ability  to  delete  a  project  form  the  list  of  recent

projects

Sometimes  there  is  no  need  to  keep  a  project on  the  list  of  recently  opened  projects.  For  example,  the
administrator may upload a project to the server and have no need to work with its local version. Now such
redundant  projects  can  be  deleted  from  the  list  of  recently  opened  projects  so  as  not  to  confuse  the
operators.

Note. The feature is only available on Windows clients.

12.

Ability to export classification statistics to a CSV file

Classification statistics can now be exported to a CSV file for further analysis.

To  export  classification  statistics  to  CSV,  open  the  Classification  Statistics  dialog  box,  click  the  Export
Statistics… button, specify a path and file name, and select the type of statistics to export. The following
export options are available: Summary, Statistics by class, Confusing classes, All classes.

The  exported  statistics will  correspond  to  the  set  of  documents  selected  in  the  Document  type  field:  For
testing, For training or both.

ABBYY  FlexiCapture  Web  Verification  Station

improvements

1.  Performance improvements for large data forms:

  Smooth scrolling for data forms containing over 600 line items

Page 7 of 10

  The GUI is now more responsive when correcting large numbers of errors

2.  Working  with  links  to  existing  fields  and  with  the  summary  section  is  now  supported.  For  more

information, see these help articles: Link to existing field, Summary section.

  Please note that you can currently work with links to existing fields and with the summary section only
within one document (e.g. a large document with multiple sections). The full functionality for working
with document sets is not currently available on the web stations.

3.  Field values of the following types can now be normalized: int, currency, date, and time.
4.  Opening tasks sped up on Web
  The Web Verification station has been redesigned. Operator waiting times for starting verification tasks

were reduced by half.

14.

ABBYY FlexiCapture Developer's Package
Release 3 includes an ABBYY FlexiCapture Developer’s Package for use with ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud and
the  ABBYY  FlexiCapture  SDK.  The  Developer’s  Package  can  be  downloaded  and  installed  separately  and
contains only the  following components required to  develop and maintain FlexiCapture  projects: Project
Setup  Station,  FlexiLayout  Studio,  FCAdminTools,  License  Manager,  and  Licensing  Server.  To  develop
projects with NLP features, NLP components must be installed.

To use Developer’s Package customers will need license for FlexiCapture Distributed with a permission to
use Project Setup Station.

Bug Fixes

Issue description
A new database could not be created and an existing database could not be upgraded in Oracle 12.0.1.* due to a
compatibility issue.
A classifier training task failed if the number of images in its training batch reached a certain limit.
Checking rules on web stations failed if working with WinAuth.
Multiple "-" symbols were not allowed in a login.
If a group contained only subgroups, syncing with AD removed all users from that subgroup.
On some scanner models, an error occurred if ISIS drivers were used for scanning.
Fixed forms became invalid after updating the project.
FlexiCapture  for  Invoices.  Keywords  from  all  recognition  languages  influenced  field  extraction  for  invoices  in
unrelated languages. For example, Russian keywords could hamper the processing of Swiss invoice. After the fix, if
the  country  is  detected,  only  languages  related  to  that  country  will  affect  field  extraction.  If  the  country  is  not
detected, the behavior will remain the same as before the fix.
While working on the web, a script rule failed if it used a shared assembly.
An error occurred when recognizing certain documents.
Table column was not found if it contained “-1” values.
Japanese UI improved based on feedback.
Project size reduced for projects with a lot of fields in Document Definitions (saving field settings in a workflow has
been optimized).
The following security issues found during penetration testing have been fixed:

Page 8 of 10

  An operator with restricted  permissions (e.g. a  Scanning Operator) was  able  to  close  sessions  of  other

Issue description

operators.

  An operator was able to postpone any task, even those already open and in use by another user.

Sometimes, the user needed to click repeatedly in order to select records in a data set.
In projects uploaded to the server, the Disabled parameter for training batches was ignored and trained layouts
were still applied.
Excessive memory usage for Document Definitions with empty FlexiLayouts.
After publishing a Document Definition on the server, an error icon was displayed even if there were no errors.
Occasional slow processing speeds when using a classifier or additional FlexiLayouts.
The Project Setup Station sometimes crashed when testing a Document Definition following a FlexiLayout update.
The crash was caused by a specific location of data fields on the data form.
After updating a .NET assembly to a different version, it was necessary to recreate a reference to this assembly and
save all the scripts once again.
During web verification, a document sent to back-end processing sometimes got stuck with an incorrect status.
An export task failed and would loop in some cases if the Delete documents after export option was on. Now this
option will be ignored and a warning will be added into the log.
The orientation of some thumbnails was incorrect after rotating pages. The bug occurred only in local projects.
After SSO integration with IdP Auth, a ticket timestamp made the ticket invalid.
Automated processing failed when executing a script that edited a field with a long text string (1000+ characters).
An error saying “Invalid character value for cast specification” occurred when comparing a 5-digit number in a field
of “Decimal” type.
Sometimes, an error occurred when a local project was used to update another project to a new version.
Field groups overlapped when scrolling data on a web station.
Sometimes, redundant indents occurred on the data form displayed on the Web Verification Station.
When using certain script rules, there were issues with loading the data form on the Web Verification Station.
In some projects, data could not be added to data sets on the Web Verification Station.
The user interface of the Web Capture Station became blocked when the user downloaded batch results locally.
Sometimes, after installing ABBYY FlexiCapture, the Administration and Monitoring Console would not open.
When the user specified an empty time period on the Monitoring & Reporting Station and then corrected the error,
the interface still indicated the time period as incorrect.
In ABBYY FlexiCapture for Invoices, reduced RAM requirements for advanced field extraction technology involving
deep learning. Previously, this feature required at least 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core, now it is decreased and require
1GB. Peaks until 2.0GB can happen on complex multipage documents.
There were problems decoding e-mail bodies with unsupported characters when importing from mail boxes.
In FlexiLayout Studio, the order of columns in a column element could not be changed.
Fixed security vulnerability issue CVE-2019-20383. Users could elevate their rights to the Administrator or System
level.
A program file required for recognition of Georgian texts was not installed. As a workaround, the required file could
be copied manually onto the stations where recognition was carried out. Now necessary files are installed during
application installation.
A training task failed if a batch contained documents for which several Document Definition versions were available.
Inline images and tables larger than A4 were not scaled correctly and so could not be processed.
Web Capture stations consumed too much backend resources, which led to random errors.

Issue description

Applications crashed during data verification after latest update of Microsoft Windows.
ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud
Sometimes, a task looped at automated processing stages.
The Project Setup Station could not open a tenant’s project in the cloud if the tenant used its own license.
After  upgrading  the  Application  Server  in  a  cluster,  all  the  nodes  had  to  be  reconfigured  manually  in  order  to
synchronize the values of the machineKey section in the web.config file.
After updating an expired license, the Processing Server had to be restarted in order to resume the processing.

Known Issues

1. Limitations  of  usage  of  Internet  Explorer  browser  for

Web stations

Due to the known limitations of Internet Explorer 11, you may observe the issues while processing dozens of pages at
once  or  having  numerous  verification  tasks  with  ABBYY  FlexiCapture.  Using  Internet  Explorer  11  browser  for  an
extended period of time can cause the browser to consume a lot of the machine's memory and slow down the client
performance and eventually crash the browser.

To avoid the unwanted interruptions of ABBYY FlexiCapture processing tasks ABBYY recommends you to use Microsoft
Edge, Google Chrome or other browsers for the professional verification tasks. Nevertheless, ABBYY FlexiCapture web-
stations are fully functioning in Internet Explorer 11, thus they should be used for ad-hoc processing preferably.

Important notes for users of Internet Explorer 11

1.

In the event of a verification malfunction, the operator will not be able to resume the task immediately after
the session is restored. This task will become available only after the inactive sessions have been purged. By
default, the time since last user activity after which inactive session will be automatically closed, is equal to
120 minutes. You can change the setting SessionInactiveLifetimeInMinutes in the web.config file on the
Application Server. We do not recommend purging inactive sessions too often. The recommended minimum
setting is 10 minutes.

2.  Starting from FlexiCapture R3 Update 1, each new task is opened in a new tab to optimize memory use when
working in Internet Explorer 11. However, this also means that operators will not be able to receive new
tasks automatically. To revert to the old behavior, open the web.config file for the web station and set the
IEVerificationNewWindow key to false.

3.  Purchase Orders matching does not work on Web Verification opened from Internet Explorer 11 in case of
several instances of Purchase Orders Numbers instances on the same document. When clicking Details
button, an error occurs (ReferenceError: 'customActionContext' is undefined). This error will be fixed in next
updates.

 > Recognizing local privilege escalation in ABBYY FineReader
![](/upload/iblock/bc8/a62d2d9039df4829ee6e772fa2be28c2.svg)

19.02.2020
# Recognizing local privilege escalation in ABBYY FineReader

I continue my series about Windows applications privilege escalation discovery. Previously on this series: Steam (CVE-2019-14743, CVE-2019-15316, CVE-2019-17180) and Origin (CVE-2019-19247, CVE-2019-19248). But today it is not about a gaming launcher, but a desktop application ABBYY FineReader.

TL;DR: I am going to tell how you can escalate privileges from user to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM in 10 minutes, using the licensing component of ABBYY FineReader. This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2019-20383, here is a link to ABBYY website: <https://support.abbyy.com/hc/ru/articles/360008536920-%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9-FineReader-15>.

### Recon

I downloaded a FineReader trial version from ABBYY website and quickly tested it on whether it is relevant to search for privilege escalation vulnerabilities. The answer was «yes» – there was a service in this product (judging by the name «ABBYY network license server», it is licensing related), which is launched with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges by default. I launched ProcMon and started looking closely at the service’s behavior.

A file placed at «C:\ProgramData\ABBYY\FineReader\15\Licenses\Licensing.cnt» grabbed my attention. The service readed something from it, wrote something to it. It looked like an interesting testing candidate. Let’s look at the «C:\ProgramData\ABBYY\FineReader\15\Licenses» folder. This folder has «All - FullControl» legacy ACL from its parent directory «C:\ProgramData\ABBYY\FineReader\15» , which means that it is possible to remove its contents, including «Licensing.cnt».

The service, on discovering that the file was removed, tries to create it in its own strange way. It creates a file named like «tmpXXXX-YYYYYYYYY.tmp», writes some data to it, then renames it to «Licensing.cnt».

Here is a ProcMon log, where this operation is performed twice

![procmon.png](/upload/medialibrary/b2d/procmon.png "procmon.png")

For the first time it occurs at 20:36, then at 20:46. Between this timestamps I removed the file again, so it could be created one more time.

Rectangle 1 in the picture shows the situation when the service discovers that the file is missing. Rectangle 2 shows the fact of temporary «.tmp» file creation. Rectangle 3 – renaming of temporary file. Rectangle 4 – repeating of the same operations 10 minutes later.

Let us revise the name format of «tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYY.tmp». XXXX will always be the same in the context of a single running process; moreover, it is an identifier of thread performing this task. YYYYYYYY is not a constant, but if we look at two consecutive launches (values: 430210515 and 430810515) a hypothesis occurs that this is some timestamp – the difference between numbers (600000) surprisingly matches with 10 minutes difference between launches. A few more test confirmed our assumption.

Summarizing this part – any user can remove «C:\ProgramData\ABBYY\FineReader\15\Licenses\Licensing.cnt» file, then, in cycle, he can constantly look for contents in «C:\ProgramData\ABBYY\FineReader\15\Licenses» folder and at some point discover a file named «tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYY.tmp» there. A user is now prepared — after removing the file he will know exactly at what time and with what name the file will be created next time.

### Now we are going to play with symlinks

Creating symlink from file to file requires administrative rights. But the requirement could be bypassed. Let’s see how we can create symlink from “C:\abc\1” to “C:\def\2”.

First, let’s create an NTFS reparse point (sometimes called NTFS mount point) from “C:\abc” directory to “\RPC Control\”. “\RPC Control\” is not a regular directory, it can’t be viewed by explorer. It’s a system object directory, which stores, for example, named mutexes, events and other similar objects. It’s not clear, why redirection with NTFS reparse point works with it, most likely because similar abstractions are used for directories in filesystem and object directories. There are two requirements for reparse point creation: a source directory must be empty and a user must have write permission on the dir.

It is possible to create symlink from object directory to file without administrative permissions. Let’s create symlink “\RPC Control\1” <-> “C:\def\2”. So all operations on “C:\abc\1” will be redirected to “C:\def\2”.

Originally the process looks like this:

![1.png](/upload/medialibrary/ee6/1.png "1.png")

If we know the exact moment of the next attempt to perform this operation, we can create the following symlinks (I skip the current directory name, which is «C:\ProgramData\ABBYY\FineReader\15\Licenses\»):

tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYA.tmp <-> C:\test\l1\proxy

tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYB.tmp <-> C:\test\l1\proxy

tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYC.tmp <-> C:\test\l1\proxy

…

tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYZ.tmp <-> C:\test\l1\proxy

Where YYYYYYYYA, YYYYYYYYB, YYYYYYYYC, … YYYYYYYYZ are different timestamps in YYYYYYYY + 10 minutes area (is case the timestamp is running a little bit late).

Then we create a link:

C:\test\l1\proxy <-> C:\test\l2\nope

Note that in reality none of these files exist. They are needed to perform two redirections so the service would work with «C:\test\l2\nope» file, if, for example, the service addresses tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYB.tmp.

As soon as we discover a creation of «C:\test\l2\nope» file, there should be created another two symlinks:

C:\test\l1\proxy <-> C:\test\l2\payload

Licensing.cnt <-> C:\target\path

The service will continue to write to «C:\test\l2\nope», but it will perform the renaming already after following a new symlink. Thus, instead of renaming, for example «tmpXXXX\_YYYYYYYYC.tmp» to «Licensing.cnt», it will rename (replace) «C:\test\l2\payload» to «C:\target\path». I**n fact, we can place any file with any content in any directory with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM permissions**.

Schematically it looks like this:

![2.png](/upload/medialibrary/625/2.png "2.png")

Colored parts represent what occurs because of symlinks.

To escalate privileges using the given primitive is easy – it is possible to replace system process’ dll with your own etc. At this point, I contacted ABBYY representatives and reported the vulnerability.

According to ABBYY, at this moment the vulnerability is fixed.
