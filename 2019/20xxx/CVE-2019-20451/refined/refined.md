{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Prismview software has multiple vulnerabilities due to improper input sanitization and insecure design.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability via the endpoint `/../PrismviewV9-Player-006.xml`, allowing access to sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.",
    "Insecure file upload endpoints `/SPLITUPLOAD`, `/UPLOAD`, and `/UPLOAD2` that do not sanitize the file paths, allowing for arbitrary file uploads and overwrites.",
    "Command Injection vulnerability via the `/PV9COMMAND` endpoint, which allows execution of arbitrary commands by manipulating the input.",
    "Lack of proper input sanitization in several endpoints allowing path traversal.",
     "Unprotected endpoints that do not require authentication or use a weak authentication scheme.",
     "Use of hardcoded credentials in configuration file.",
      "RebootSystem.lnk and WinVNC.exe overwrite vulnerability."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access, upload malicious files, execute arbitrary commands, and achieve code execution on the targeted system. This allows for complete control of the billboard, potentially displaying arbitrary content, disrupting operations or even causing further harm to the embedded system by overwriting executable files.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints",
      "Manipulation of HTTP headers and multipart data to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server",
    "Abuse of unsanitized input to trigger commands via `/PV9COMMAND` endpoint.",
    "Path traversal via `..` sequences in URLs."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the billboard server. No prior authentication may be needed or they may need to acquire credentials using LFI."
