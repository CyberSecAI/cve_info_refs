The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20706.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection vulnerability in Netgear R7800 and XR500 routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has authenticated could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.

**Attack vectors:** The attack is post-authentication, so the attacker needs valid credentials to log into the device's management interface to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to access the router's administrative interface to execute commands.

The provided information includes the following:
- Affected products: R7800 and XR500 routers
- Affected firmware versions: R7800 prior to 1.0.2.60, XR500 prior to 2.3.2.32
- CVSS v3 score: 8 (High)
- CVSS v3 vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, which translates to:
    - Attack Vector: Adjacent
    - Attack Complexity: Low
    - Privileges Required: None (This may be an error since the description says "post-authentication.")
    - User Interaction: None
    - Scope: Unchanged
    - Confidentiality: High
    - Integrity: High
    - Availability: High
