{
  "CVE-2019-20388": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "When ctxt->schema is NULL, xmlSchemaSAXPlug->xmlSchemaPreRun allocates a new schema for ctxt->schema and sets vctxt->xsiAssemble to 1. Then xmlSchemaVStart->xmlSchemaPreRun initializes vctxt->xsiAssemble to 0 again, which causes the allocated schema to not be freed.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak due to incorrect handling of schema allocation and freeing within the xmlSchema validation process.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory exhaustion leading to denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted XML file to a vulnerable application, an attacker can trigger the memory leak.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted XML input to an application using libxml2."
