The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20756. It is a security advisory for a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability found in several Netgear router and extender models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication buffer overflow

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the affected devices that can be exploited after successful authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected devices. This is not specifically mentioned but, is implied as it is a typical impact for a buffer overflow and the CVSS score is high. The advisory also mentions the vector including "C:H/I:L/A:N", meaning high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact and no availability impact.

**Attack vectors:** This is a post-authentication vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the device's management interface. The CVSS vector indicates "AV:A" which means the attacker needs to be adjacent to the network.
