Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20441

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the WSO2 API Manager. It arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically within the 'context' variable during the API creation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the 'context' field and persistently stored by the application. When the affected page is viewed, the stored script is executed within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application. This code could perform actions within the context of the victim's session.
*   **UI Manipulation:** The attacker can modify the appearance of the web page.
*   **Data Retrieval:** The attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information accessible to the user's browser.
*   **Redirection:** An attacker can redirect the user to a malicious website.
*   **Session Hijacking (Mitigated):** While session cookies are protected with 'httpOnly' flags, which prevents direct access via JavaScript, other session-related attacks might be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves modifying a legitimate HTTP POST request made during the 'implement phase' of API creation.
*   **Harmful Request Parameter:** Specifically, the 'context' parameter within the POST request is injected with the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a logged-in user with the ability to create or modify APIs within WSO2 API Manager.
*   **Proxy Tool:** The attacker needs a proxy tool (like Burp Suite) to intercept and modify the HTTP request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0.
*   The issue was reported to WSO2, and a patch was released.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on July 5, 2019.
*   The 'context' variable is vulnerable to XSS injection.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a "Medium" severity.
*   The XSS payload used in the proof of concept is `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.
