# AFFECTED PRODUCTS:

[1] WSO2 API Manager

# Description:

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WSO2 API Manager Product. By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies which means that the malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

The following Vulnerability is tested on WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0 Product.

Issue 01: Stored cross site scripting:

# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2019-20441 – Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### WSO2

#### Affected Product

##### WSO2 API Manager

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20441

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-01-1022

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### July 6, 2019

### Description

An issue was discovered on HTTP post request in WSO2 API Manager 2.6.0 in the ‘implement phase’ of the API Publisher. A stored cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the application.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on the WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0 Product.

Issue 01: Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

***Figure 07:* *Stored XSS payload in the source code.***

### Impact

Through an XSS attack, the attacker can make the browser redirect to a malicious website. Unauthorized actions such as changing the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser are possible. But since all session-related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flat and protected, session hijacking or mounting a similar attack would not be possible.

### Remediations
