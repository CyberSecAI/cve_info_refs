  "CVE-2019-20444": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 that allows an HTTP header that lacks a colon, which might be interpreted as a separate header with an incorrect syntax, or might be interpreted as an 'invalid fold.' HTTP headers with an invalid fold, in this case CRLF (carriage return, line feed) without being followed by SP (space) or HTAB (horizontal tab), result in situations where headers can be misread.",
    "impact": "Data integrity is the highest threat with this vulnerability. HTTP request smuggling can be achieved.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of HTTP headers",
      "HTTP request smuggling"
    ],
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP request with malformed headers that lack a colon or has a CRLF without SP or HTAB."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
