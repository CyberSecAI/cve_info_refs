Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20436

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `dialect` variable within the WSO2 Identity Server's claim management functionality doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This code is then stored and later executed when a user views or interacts with the stored data through the application's interface, specifically in the service provider claim dialect configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized user input, which is later executed by other users. Specifically, the `dialect` variable in the URL `https://localhost:9443/carbon/identity-claim-mgt/add-dialect-finish-ajaxprocessor.jsp` is vulnerable.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `dialect` variable input before storing it in the database/system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking (Potential):** Although the session cookies are set with httpOnly flag which prevents direct session hijacking, the attacker can still perform malicious actions like redirecting the user to malicious sites, modify UI, or attempt to steal non-sensitive information.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform unauthorized actions such as changing the UI of the webpage, retrieving non-sensitive information, and potentially more, depending on the capabilities of the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through a POST request to the vulnerable URL via the `dialect` variable.
*   **Stored XSS Execution:** The injected payload is stored, and later executed when another user views or selects the configured claim dialect, typically during service provider configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the WSO2 Identity Server's management console.
*   **Privileges:** The attacker must have privileges to add and configure claim dialects and service providers within the WSO2 application.

**Affected Products:**
*   WSO2 API Manager
*   WSO2 API Manager Analytics
*   WSO2 IS as Key Manager
*   WSO2 Identity Server
*   WSO2 Identity Server Analytics

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating the injection of `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` and its execution.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on June 25, 2019, and reported to WSO2 the same day.
*   The vendor, WSO2, released patches to address the vulnerability for the affected product versions.
*   The vulnerability was assigned the Securin ID: 2019-CSW-11-1029.
