  "CVE-2019-20149": {
    "description": "Versions of `kind-of` 6.x prior to 6.0.3 are vulnerable to a Validation Bypass. A maliciously crafted object can alter the result of the type check, allowing attackers to bypass the type checking validation.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from relying on the `constructor.name` property of user-provided objects for type detection. This property can be manipulated by an attacker to influence the results of type checks.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "The library uses the `constructor.name` property to determine the type of an object, which can be controlled by a malicious user."
      ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to type check bypass. This could allow an attacker to pass a maliciously crafted object disguised as a different type (e.g., a plain object as a string), leading to unexpected behavior and potentially further vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a crafted object, likely through an API or other network interface, to an application that uses the vulnerable `kind-of` library.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send user-controlled input (a crafted object) to an application or service that uses the vulnerable `kind-of` library.",
    "additional_details": "The fix involves adding a check to ensure the constructor property is a function, preventing attackers from directly injecting strings to manipulate the type check. However, it was discussed that malicious users could also override the `toString()` method, though this was considered a less practical attack vector and addressed in future versions."
