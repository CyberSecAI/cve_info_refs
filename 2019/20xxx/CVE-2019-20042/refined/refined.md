{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `wp_targeted_link_rel()` function was vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) due to improper handling of link attributes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
	  "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into links that would then be executed in a victim's browser.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted link with a target attribute could be stored by an attacker and when rendered in the context of a user's browser, this would trigger the injected javascript code.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify content containing links that is then processed by the vulnerable function. An attacker needs to be authenticated."

  "cve_id": "CVE-2019-20042",
  "addtional_info": "The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `wp_targeted_link_rel()` function to correctly handle link attributes and prevent XSS attacks. Specifically the fix involved sanitizing the rel attribute of targeted links and properly handling cases with missing or malformed attributes. The patch also ensures that script and style tags within the processed text are not altered by the function. The function now handles escaped quotes within link attributes, ensuring proper parsing."
