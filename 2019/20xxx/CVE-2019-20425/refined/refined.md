{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a lack of validation for specific fields of packets sent by the client in the ptlrpc module. Specifically, the `lustre_msg_string` function does not check the value of `blen` derived from `lustre_msg_buflen_v2`, leading to an out-of-bounds read in `strnlen`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious client can cause a kernel panic on the server by sending crafted packets, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious client sends specially crafted packets to the server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the Lustre server as a client."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The issue is resolved in Lustre versions 2.13.0 and 2.12.3."
