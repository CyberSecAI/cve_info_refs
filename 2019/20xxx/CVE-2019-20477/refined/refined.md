The provided content discusses CVE-2019-20477 and YAML deserialization vulnerabilities in Python, particularly focusing on the PyYAML and ruamel.yaml libraries. It explains the risks associated with using `yaml.load()` and `yaml.full_load()` with untrusted input due to the `python/object/apply` constructor.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient restrictions on the `load` and `load_all` functions in PyYAML due to class deserialization issues. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the `python/object/apply` constructor within `FullLoader`. This allows arbitrary code execution when processing untrusted YAML files. The issue is related to an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-18342.

*   **Vulnerability/Weakness:** Unsafe deserialization of YAML data, leading to arbitrary code execution. The `FullLoader` in PyYAML (versions >= 5.1) and the default `Loader` in ruamel.yaml are vulnerable when parsing untrusted input. The vulnerability is triggered by the `python/object/apply` constructor which allows instantiation of arbitrary Python objects.

*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system by crafting malicious YAML files that exploit the `python/object/apply` constructor.

*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a malicious YAML file to an application that uses PyYAML or ruamel.yaml to parse the file using a vulnerable loader (e.g., `FullLoader` or the default `Loader`).

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a YAML file to be processed by a vulnerable application. No other specific capabilities or positioning are mentioned beyond that.

*   **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to avoid using `yaml.load()` or `yaml.full_load()` with untrusted input. Instead, use `yaml.safe_load()` or the `SafeLoader` to parse YAML data from untrusted sources.

The document also provides detailed code examples demonstrating the vulnerability and how to exploit it, as well as how to generate payloads using `subprocess.Popen`. It also describes the patches applied in PyYAML versions >= 5.1 and how they can be bypassed under certain conditions.
