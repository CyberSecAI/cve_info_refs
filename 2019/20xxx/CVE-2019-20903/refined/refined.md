Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20903

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `atlaskit/editor-core` handles hyperlinks. Specifically, the link target was not properly sanitized, which allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization for link targets, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript, leading to potential:
    -  Data theft
    -  Session hijacking
    -  Website defacement
    -  Redirection to malicious sites
    -  Other malicious activities executed within the context of the user's browser

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is network-based, meaning it can be performed remotely.
- The attacker injects malicious code via a crafted link target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low Privileges: The attacker needs minimal privileges to insert the malicious link (it appears a user with low privileges is enough to perform this action).
- User Interaction: The user has to interact with the crafted link (e.g., by clicking on it) for the exploit to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `atlaskit/editor-core` before `113.1.5`.
- The provided CVSS v3 score indicates a medium severity.
- The vulnerability is present in the `atlaskit/editor-core` component.
- The fix is to upgrade to `113.1.5` or later
