        "section": "Composition Kills: A Case Study of Email Sender Authentication",
        "content": "The primary vulnerability is the inconsistent interpretation of email messages between different components within email systems. This inconsistency allows attackers to bypass email authentication mechanisms, impersonate senders, and forge DKIM-signed emails.  Specifically, there are issues when SPF, DKIM and DMARC components, that are supposed to work in conjunction, miscommunicate or do not consistently authenticate the same sender identity. The inconsistency may arise due to: vague standards that allow different interpretations, implementation that tries to be tolerant of malformed inputs, and combinations of different features in different components that were not accounted for, also creating potential for feature chaining to cause unexpected computation. The email processing flow involves various components such as Sending Server, Receiving Server (with SPF, DKIM, DMARC, DNS components), and MUA, making it vulnerable to composition-related attacks. Attackers can exploit the inconsistencies that arise in message processing between these components to bypass security measures designed to protect email authenticity. The report identifies three classes of attacks: intra-server attacks, UI-mismatch attacks, and ambiguous-replay attacks.",

The report details various specific exploits (A1 to A18), categorized into intra-server, UI-mismatch, and ambiguous-replay attacks. The analysis reveals that all email providers tested are vulnerable to UI-mismatch and ambiguous-replay attacks. Some providers are also vulnerable to intra-server attacks. MUAs are also vulnerable to misinterpreting headers and email addresses. Specific examples are provided illustrating how different combinations of email providers and clients can suffer from vulnerabilities due to their different handling of various features.",
