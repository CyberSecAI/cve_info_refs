Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a double-free that occurs in the `yyparse()` function of the `libyang` library when processing a YANG file with an empty description. The issue stems from how the library handles memory allocation and deallocation when parsing specific YANG constructs like "description" statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a double-free. This happens when the same memory location is deallocated twice, which leads to memory corruption, and can crash the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a crash, leading to a denial of service. An attacker can provide a crafted YANG file with an empty description to trigger the double-free, causing the application using the vulnerable libyang library to terminate.
- **Potential Code Execution:**  While not explicitly demonstrated in the provided text, it is noted that the double-free "possibly" leads to code execution. While not confirmed, memory corruption vulnerabilities like double-frees can sometimes be exploited for arbitrary code execution with more sophisticated techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious YANG Files:** The attack vector is a specially crafted YANG file with an empty description field within a module, extension, or other construct that uses the `yang_read_extcomplex_str` function. This file would need to be processed by an application using the vulnerable `libyang` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide input:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted YANG file to an application that uses the vulnerable `libyang` library.
- **No special privileges:** No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, meaning a remote user providing malicious input to a network service that uses the libyang library is sufficient to trigger it.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability resides in `src/parser_yang.c` and how it handles string values. The commit `d9feacc4a590d35dbc1af21caf9080008b4450ed` introduces a fix for this by modifying the `yang_read_extcomplex_str` function to handle string allocation and deallocation correctly.
- The fix involves modifying `parser_yang.c`, `parser_yang.h`, `parser_yang_bis.c`, and `yang.y.in`. Specifically, it changes the `yang_read_extcomplex_str` to accept `char **value` instead of `char *value`, and introduces changes in `parser_yang_bis.c` and `yang.y.in` to reflect this change, ensuring that the memory containing the string is freed properly.
- The original bug was reported in [issue #742](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/742) of the libyang repository.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Debian Security Advisory DLA-3572-1 mentions that multiple vulnerabilities, including this one, were fixed in version `0.16.105+really1.0-0+deb10u1` of the `libyang` package.
- Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 1793930 also tracks this issue, noting the double-free occurs when an empty description is used and that this vulnerability is present in versions up to `1.0-r1` of `libyang`.
- The fix is available in the commit [`d9feacc4a590d35dbc1af21caf9080008b4450ed`](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/commit/d9feacc4a590d35dbc1af21caf9080008b4450ed)
