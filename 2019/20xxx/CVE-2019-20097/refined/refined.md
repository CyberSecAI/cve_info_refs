The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20097.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an argument injection vulnerability in Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Data Center. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject additional arguments into Git commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Argument Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input when constructing Git commands, allowing the injection of malicious arguments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By injecting malicious arguments into Git commands, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server hosting Bitbucket.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Access: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability if they have network access to a Git repository in Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center.
- Public Access: If public access is enabled for a project or repository, attackers can exploit this issue anonymously.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with a Git repository within Bitbucket Server or Data Center. This can be achieved through direct access or, if public access is enabled, through anonymous means.
