{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in the `BS_ReadByte` function, which occurs when processing a malformed MP4 file. Specifically, the issue arises when parsing the PMT (Program Map Table) within an MPEG-TS stream, where an IOD (Initial Object Descriptor) is declared with a length that is either less than 2 bytes or exceeds the available data in the buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow due to incorrect handling of descriptor length in PMT parsing.",
       "Improper input validation when reading IOD length, leading to out-of-bounds read."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a crash due to the heap-buffer-overflow, potentially causing a denial of service. In more severe cases, it could lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overflowed data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted MP4 file (MPEG-TS stream) to MP4Box."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to create or modify an MP4 file to include a malicious PMT with a faulty IOD.",
      "The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious file to a system running the vulnerable version of GPAC."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in `src/utils/bitstream.c` during a read operation in the `BS_ReadByte` function. The root cause is triggered when `gf_odf_parse_descriptor` is called on a malformed IOD from a PMT. The fix commit `1ab4860` addresses this issue by adding checks to ensure the length is at least 2 bytes, and the length does not exceed buffer length, preventing the out of bounds read. The provided ASAN output in the report also pinpoints the overflow."
