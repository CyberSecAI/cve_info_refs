This document describes a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and gateway models.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection, meaning it can be exploited after an attacker has already gained access to the device's administrative interface. The specific mechanism of the injection is not detailed in the document.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   Post-authentication command injection

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices. This could lead to:
*   Complete system compromise.
*   Data exfiltration.
*   Denial of service.
*   Installation of malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local to the network, requiring the attacker to have already authenticated to the device's administrative interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   The attacker needs to have administrative access to the affected NETGEAR devices. This suggests that an attacker may have already gained credentials for an administrative user or may have other access that allows them to login as an admin.

**Affected Products/Firmware Versions:**
The following NETGEAR products with specific firmware versions are vulnerable:
*   D6100, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.63
*   R7800, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.52
*   R8900, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.2
*   R9000, firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.2
*   WNDR3700v4, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.102
*   WNDR4300v1, firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.104
*   WNDR4300v2, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.58
*   WNDR4500v3, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.58
*   WNR2000v5, firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.68
*   XR500, firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.32

**Mitigation:**
*   Update the device to the latest firmware version available from the NETGEAR support site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory assigns a CVSS v3 score of 6.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
* The advisory does not link this vulnerability to a CVE, stating "Associated CVE IDs: None"
*  The advisory credits "aircut" for reporting the vulnerability.
