Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20798:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly references CVE-2019-20798 and provides details about a vulnerability in the Cherokee web server.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the `handler_server_info`. Specifically, the requested URL is improperly displayed on the "About" page of the Cherokee web server and its administrator panel. The server does not properly encode the URL before including it in the HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (the requested URL) before being rendered on the "About" page.
*  **Vulnerable Handler:**  The `handler_server_info` is vulnerable.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** An attacker can inject JavaScript to perform actions within the context of the user's session, especially within the admin panel context.
*   **Remote Server Reconfiguration:** The XSS in the admin panel allows for reconfiguring the server and executing arbitrary commands, potentially leading to full server compromise. The exploit can programmatically simulate filling proper inputs in the admin panel, achieving RCE with no further user interaction.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript payload and sends it to a victim user.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker might need to trick the user into clicking the malicious link or navigate to the vulnerable page.
*   **Web Browsers:** The exploit is triggered by the user's web browser when visiting the crafted URL.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable "About" page or how to trigger the `/about` endpoint.
*   **URL Crafting Skills:** Ability to create a malicious URL containing the appropriate JavaScript payload.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user (especially an admin) to click the malicious URL or visit the vulnerable page.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit can be used in both the default Cherokee configuration and the administrator panel.
*   The vulnerability was found by Mateusz Kocielski and Micha≈Ç Dardas from LogicalTrust.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during manual testing after fuzzing revealed several other vulnerabilities.
*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept URL demonstrating the XSS.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed.
