The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability found in LiquiFireOS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows user-controlled input to be used as a URL in a request to an external resource. The application does not properly validate or sanitize this input, which allows an attacker to craft malicious URLs to access internal or other restricted resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SSRF vulnerability due to lack of proper validation/sanitization of user-provided URLs.
- The application supports multiple protocols (http, ftp, file, cms) which widens the attack surface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause the application to make requests to arbitrary URLs, including internal resources.
- An attacker could potentially access files on the server using the `file://` protocol, or interact with other internal services or network resources.
- The attacker can use an external ftp server to log in with specific credentials.
- Potential for information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating the `url` parameter in the HTTP request. The specific vulnerable parameter is `call[url]`.
- By providing a malicious URL that points to internal resources, or external resources using ftp protocol with credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
