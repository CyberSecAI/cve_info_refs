{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2019-20786",
    "root_cause": "The PionDTLS server freely processes unencrypted application data after a handshake has been completed. This is caused by a missing check for the epoch number of the received ApplicationData.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The DTLS server does not properly check if ApplicationData is encrypted after a handshake is completed.",
	  "The DTLS server accepts ApplicationData with epoch 0, which indicates that the data is not encrypted."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary unencrypted application data into the established connection, potentially leading to data compromise or manipulation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker establishes a valid DTLS connection.",
      "The attacker sends an ApplicationData message with epoch 0."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to establish a valid DTLS connection with the vulnerable server."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    {
      "component": "PionDTLS",
      "fix_commit": "fd73a5df2ff0e1fb6ae6a51e2777d7a16cc4f4e0",
      "fix_description": "The fix enforces that ApplicationData messages have an epoch different than 0, to ensure that data is encrypted."
    }
