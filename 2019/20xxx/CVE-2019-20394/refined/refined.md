Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20394:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a double-free error within the `yyparse()` function of the `libyang` library. This occurs when a "type" statement is used inside a "notification" statement in a YANG data model file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free: The same memory is freed twice, leading to heap corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The double-free can cause the application using `libyang` to crash.
- Potential code execution: In some scenarios, heap corruption can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by an attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious YANG file: An attacker provides a specially crafted YANG file containing a "type" statement within a "notification" statement.
- Parsing untrusted input: Applications using `libyang` that parse untrusted YANG files are vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to supply a crafted YANG file to an application using the vulnerable `libyang` library.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported in `libyang` up to version `v1.0-r3`.
- The issue is tracked upstream as [CESNET/libyang#769](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/769).
- The fix was implemented in commit [6cc51b1757dfbb7cff92de074ada65e8523289a6](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/commit/6cc51b1757dfbb7cff92de074ada65e8523289a6) by adding a check to prevent a double free.
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the `lys_parse_path` function.
- The vulnerable code is located in `src/parser_yang_bis.c` and `src/yang.y.in` in the libyang library.
