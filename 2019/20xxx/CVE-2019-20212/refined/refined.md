{
  "CVE-2019-20212": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WordPress themes, TownHub, EasyBook and CityBook,  suffer from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
         "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or stealing of administrator cookies. Additionally, an attacker could delete arbitrary posts/pages/listings and remove the \"featured\" status of any listing.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Manipulating the search input field",
        "Using a chat functionality",
        "Submitting data via vulnerable input fields in listing submissions",
        "Directly accessing admin-ajax.php with crafted requests"
        ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable WordPress site. No special user privileges are needed for most XSS and IDOR vulnerabilities, but for the persistent XSS, some user interaction may be required to trigger vulnerable functionality, such as submitting a chat message or creating a listing."
