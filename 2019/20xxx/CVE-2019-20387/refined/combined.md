less than length of input schema, we got a read overflow
in asan test.

Package        : libsolv
Version        : 0.6.5-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-20387
Debian Bug     : 949611

repodata_schema2id in repodata.c in libsolv, a dependency solver library,
had a heap-based buffer over-read via a last schema whose length could be
less than the length of the input schema.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.6.5-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libsolv packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
