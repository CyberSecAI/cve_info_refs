Based on the provided bug reports, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by uncontrolled recursion within the expression evaluation functions in `asm/eval.c`. Specifically, the functions `expr6`, `expr5`, `expr4`, `expr3`, `expr2`, `expr1`, and `expr0` recursively call each other.
- Input files with a large number of nested expressions (specifically, a high number of '{' characters, but not exclusively) can cause the recursion to reach excessive depths, exhausting the stack space.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Stack exhaustion (Stack Overflow):** The primary vulnerability is a stack overflow due to unbounded recursion. The recursive calls consume stack memory with each call, and without a mechanism to limit recursion depth, the stack can be exhausted.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The immediate impact is a denial-of-service. The program crashes due to stack overflow, preventing it from functioning.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While the reports specifically mention a stack overflow due to excessive recursion leading to a crash (SIGSEGV), stack overflows *can* be exploited for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully craft the input to overwrite return addresses or other critical parts of the stack frame. However, this is not explicitly mentioned or confirmed.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted assembly files:** An attacker could create a specially crafted assembly file containing a deeply nested expression that triggers the excessive recursion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted assembly file to the NASM assembler. This implies they either have direct access to the system where NASM is used or can cause a user or process to assemble the malicious file.

**Additional details:**

- The bug reports include example Proof-of-Concept (PoC) assembly files that can trigger the vulnerability.
- The Address Sanitizer (ASAN) output shows the stack trace leading to the stack overflow within the mentioned expression evaluation functions.
- The bug reports mention that the vulnerability is present in NASM versions 2.14.02 and 2.14.03rc1.
- A temporary mitigation to increase stack limit via `ulimit -s` was suggested, but not a permanent solution.
- A suggestion to implement a recursion limit similar to binutils was also proposed.

This information provides a good understanding of the stack exhaustion vulnerability in NASM, caused by infinite recursion in the expression evaluation functions. It is likely that the vulnerability mentioned in these bug reports corresponds to CVE-2019-20334 since the bug report specifies a stack overflow in the `expr3` function, as does CVE-2019-20334
