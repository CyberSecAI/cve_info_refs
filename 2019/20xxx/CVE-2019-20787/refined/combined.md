Though it does not compromise the security of the host (e.g. no arbitrary accesses in memory) it lets an attacker force a server to repetitively shut down.  The 0.7.5 release is a security update that aims to patch this server exploit. As such, it is very light in features, and is mostly made of fixes. You can find the full changelog here. If you are not a server host, it is not necessary to update. If you are hosting a server modification, you should at least consider to apply c68402fa7e2. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1170252#c1)  Martin Hauke   2020-04-23 19:31:55 UTC  ``` Should be fixed with an update to version 0.7.5: Factory SR#796693 Leap15.1 SR#796694 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1170252#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-23 20:00:05 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1170252) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/796694> 15.1 / teeworlds ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1170252#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-27 22:17:29 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0557-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.

#### Re: Changelog 0.7.4

ddrace servers are the classical dummy drag race, where you need two or more players to win the race.
the vanilla client NEVER supported such features and will never support stuff like dummies, as that has nothing to do with the basic gameplay in CTF, DM, LMS, etc.
You seem to have misunderstood, how this works.
Dummies are usually supported by custom clients, in case of 0.7.x that is currently the case with Zillywoods and F-Client (I use neither, thus cannot help you any further)

Dune also has a custom client, that does not target DDRace, the Gamer Client.

well, if there is no "iddrace" such thing in the server list, those mods were not ported to 0.7 and thus are dead.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 31 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Automatic R runtime dependencies](/wiki/Changes/Automatic_R_runtime_dependencies "Changes/Automatic R runtime dependencies")
* [Python means Python3](/wiki/Changes/Python_means_Python3 "Changes/Python means Python3")
* [The GNU C Library version 2.30](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC230 "Changes/GLIBC230")
* [Switch RPMs to zstd compression](/wiki/Changes/Switch_RPMs_to_zstd_compression "Changes/Switch RPMs to zstd compression")
* [Changes/MinGW environment and toolchain update](/wiki/Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Golang 1.13](/wiki/Changes/golang1.13 "Changes/golang1.13")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 24th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f31
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f31. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f31 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f31
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f31-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f31 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=medium  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1829192,1829193  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1829193#c2)  Fedora Update System    2020-04-29 16:33:41 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-0d6b80678a has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-0d6b80678a>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1829193#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-04-30 04:48:31 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-0d6b80678a has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository. In short time you'll be able to install the update with the following command: `sudo dnf upgrade --enablerepo=updates-testing --advisory=FEDORA-2020-0d6b80678a` You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-0d6b80678a>  See also [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for more information on how to test updates.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1829193#c4)  Ben Cotton    2020-04-30 20:10:41 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 30 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 30 on 2020-05-26. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '30'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 30 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1829193#c5)  Fedora Update System    2020-05-08 03:31:51 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-0d6b80678a has been pushed to the Fedora 30 stable repository. If problem still persists, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
