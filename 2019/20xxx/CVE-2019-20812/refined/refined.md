## Analysis of CVE-2019-20812

The CVE-2019-20812 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af\_packet.c. The vulnerability is located in the `prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo()` function and involves TPACKET\_V3.

### Root cause
The `prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo()` function in `net/packet/af_packet.c` can lead to a denial of service due to high CPU consumption and soft lockup. This occurs under specific failure conditions related to TPACKET\_V3.

### Vulnerability

The core issue stems from the `prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo` function. If `__ethtool_get_link_ksettings()` fails, the `msec` and `tmo` variables are left as zero. This results in `tov_in_jiffies` also being zero. Consequently, the `retire_blk_timer` is set to expire immediately using `mod_timer(&pkc->retire_blk_timer, jiffies + 0)`, leading to a continuous loop and high CPU usage in the softirq context.

### Impact
Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition characterized by high CPU consumption and a soft lockup, effectively making the system unresponsive.

### Attack Vectors
A local attacker capable of influencing the conditions that cause `__ethtool_get_link_ksettings()` to fail could trigger this vulnerability.

### Required capabilities
The attacker needs to be able to cause the `__ethtool_get_link_ksettings()` function to fail to trigger the vulnerability.

### Technical details
- Affected file: `net/packet/af_packet.c`
- Vulnerable function: `prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo()`
- The vulnerability is triggered when `__ethtool_get_link_ksettings()` fails.

### Fix
The fix ensures that a default value is set for `tmo` to prevent an infinite loop scenario.
Specifically, setting `tmo` to `DEFAULT_PRB_RETIRE_TOV` when `__ethtool_get_link_ksettings` fails.
```c
 int prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo(struct packet_sock *po,
 {
 ...
                if (err) {
                        msec = 1;
+                       tmo = DEFAULT_PRB_RETIRE_TOV;
                div = ecmd.base.speed / 1000;
        }

```
