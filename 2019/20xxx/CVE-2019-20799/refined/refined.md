Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-20799:

**CVE-2019-20799:**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2019-20799 is associated with a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the admin handler of the Cherokee webserver. This vulnerability is triggered when a POST request is sent with an empty body.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `cherokee_handler_admin_read_post` function in `cherokee/handler_admin.c`. Specifically, if the POST body is empty, `post.buf` becomes NULL. The code then attempts to use `strchr` on this NULL pointer, resulting in a dereference.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of a check for a NULL `post.buf` before calling `strchr`. This allows an attacker to trigger a null pointer dereference leading to a crash.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as the webserver process crashes.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request sent to the admin handler with an empty body.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server. No authentication is required, as this vulnerability is triggered when processing the request headers.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was found by Mateusz Kocielski and Micha≈Ç Dardas from LogicalTrust.
*   The exploit code provided uses `curl -d ""` to send an empty POST body to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The issue is present in the `handler_admin.c` file, specifically around line 240, within the `cherokee_handler_admin_read_post` function.
*   The specific commit of the Cherokee code base used for analysis is 9a75e65.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "low" severity but is remotely exploitable.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability, associated with CVE-2019-20799, is a null pointer dereference in the admin handler of the Cherokee webserver. It occurs when a POST request with an empty body is processed, causing a crash and DoS. It can be triggered remotely with a crafted HTTP request, requiring no prior authentication.
