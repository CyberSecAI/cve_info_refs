The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20502.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `body2.ghp` component of Easy Chat Server version 3.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the handling of the `message` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a remote denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the server, including a specially crafted `message` parameter to cause a buffer overflow when processed by the vulnerable `body2.ghp` component. This occurs after a valid session is established via a GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server. They must be able to first establish a valid session (via GET) before attempting to exploit the POST request with the overflowing message.
