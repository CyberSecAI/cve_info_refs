Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20367:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `nlist.c` file of the `libbsd` library.
*   Specifically, when performing a string comparison for symbol names from the string table (`strtab`), the code did not ensure a bounded comparison. A non-NULL terminated string could cause the code to read beyond the allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory outside the bounds of an allocated buffer. This happens due to a lack of proper bounds checking during string comparison.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The out-of-bounds read could potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory beyond the intended buffer.
*   **Denial of Service:** Accessing invalid memory locations can lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior, causing a denial of service. In some cases it could potentially be used to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a specially formed string table within an ELF file. This could involve a non-NUL terminated string for a symbol name within the string table of an executable or library.
* The `nlist()` function is used to read symbol table information from an executable or object file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide an ELF file with a crafted string table to the vulnerable application or system library that uses libbsd.
*   No specific privileges are explicitly mentioned in the provided content. The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication.
*   The attack vector is network-accessible according to the CVSS v2/v3 scores.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves ensuring a bounded comparison when reading string symbols, preventing out-of-bounds reads.
*   Multiple distributions like openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian have released patches to address this vulnerability.
*   The issue was initially reported by Daniel Hodson and Coverity Scan.
*   The fix was included in libbsd version 0.10.0.
*   The vulnerability is rated as moderate by SUSE, although CVSS v3 scores indicate a higher severity.
