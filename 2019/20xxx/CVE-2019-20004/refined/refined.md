Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper session handling after an administrator password change on Intelbras IWR 3000N 1.8.7 devices. After changing the password from a specific IP address, administrative authorization for that IP address is not invalidated, allowing access without requiring a password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Session Management:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly invalidate or update session information tied to the administrator login after a password change. The device appears to maintain an authenticated session based on the client's IP address, even after the password has changed.
*   **Lack of Proper Authentication:** The device is not properly verifying credentials for a user connecting from the original IP address after a password change, effectively bypassing the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Complete Control of the Router:** An attacker who has the same IP address that was used to change the password can gain complete administrative access to the router without knowing the current password, potentially allowing for malicious configuration changes, traffic interception, or other harmful actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** An attacker on the same local network, or an attacker able to spoof the IP of the user that changed the password can directly exploit the vulnerability. The attacker just needs to use the web interface to access the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Same Network/IP Address Spoofing:** The attacker must either be on the same network or be able to spoof the IP address that was used to change the password.
*   **Basic Network Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of networking to be able to locate the router and potentially spoof the IP address.
*   **Access to the Router's Web Interface:** The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface through a web browser.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Intelbras IWR 3000N 1.8.7 devices, and is triggered when the password is changed from a specific IP.
* The proof of concept provided shows how the router can be accessed without authentication from the original IP address used to make the password change.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain complete control of the router without the knowledge of the current password by utilizing a flaw in session management after a password change is performed.
