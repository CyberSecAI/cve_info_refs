Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, focusing on CVE-2019-20153:

**CVE-2019-20153 (XXE)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's processing of XML data, specifically the `definition_upload_attach.jsp` endpoint. It allows for external XML entities to be called upon. The application server's XML settings are not configured to prevent external entity inclusion, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Weakness:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability due to insecure parsing of XML data which allows for external entity resolution.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform data exfiltration. By crafting a malicious XML document that includes a reference to an external DTD file, the attacker can force the application server to fetch and process this file. The DTD can be crafted to retrieve files from the application server and send them to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious XML document and submits it to the `definition_upload_attach.jsp` endpoint via a POST request, specifically targeting the `XML_Template_1_Text` parameter. The attacker must host a malicious DTD file on a remote server accessible to the application server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application server and needs an accessible server to host a malicious DTD file. The attacker also requires administrative access to the application.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The blog post details how data can be retrieved out-of-band by using a remotely hosted DTD file. It also specifies that data retrieval over HTTP was not possible, requiring the use of FTP.
*   The post shows a specific example of how to extract the contents of the `win.ini` file from a Windows server via FTP.
