{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory Traversal",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server."
