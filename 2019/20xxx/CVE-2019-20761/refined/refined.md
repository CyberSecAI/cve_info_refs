- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Post-authentication command injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after a user has authenticated to the device.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Confidentiality: Limited (C:L)
    - Integrity: High (I:H)
    - Availability: High (A:H)
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated (PR:L) to exploit this vulnerability. No user interaction is required (UI:N).

The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H` and the score is 7.1 (High).
The advisory states that the vulnerability is present in R7800 devices running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.62.
