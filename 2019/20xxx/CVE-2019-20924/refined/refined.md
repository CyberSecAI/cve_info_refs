- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bug in the query planner can trigger an invariant in the `IndexBoundsBuilder` when handling specific types of queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the `IndexBoundsBuilder` component within the query engine, where an unexpected state can be reached due to crafted queries. Specifically, the issue occurs at the provided code location (`https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/8010c51d3f1cc1020959f8b351f8242d141d42a3/src/mongo/db/query/index_bounds_builder.cpp#L450`).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, likely crashing the server due to the triggered invariant.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending specially crafted database queries to the vulnerable MongoDB server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a user authorized to perform database queries to trigger this vulnerability.
