- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses client-side JavaScript to validate file extensions, which can be easily bypassed by intercepting and modifying the JavaScript response before it is processed by the browser.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Client-side validation: The application relies on JavaScript to check for allowed file extensions (.jpg, .png, .jpeg), which is insufficient for security because it can be easily bypassed.
    - Lack of server-side validation: The application does not perform server-side validation of uploaded files, allowing the attacker to upload files with malicious extensions.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE).

- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack by intercepting the JavaScript response using a proxy tool like Burp Suite.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a high privileged account on the system in order to modify or create an employee. The attacker must also have the ability to intercept network traffic, which can be achieved with a tool like Burp Suite. The attack can be conducted remotely.
