## Notes

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

it appears this CVE is only for the suspend job because it is
the only one that doesn't require write permissions.
In libvirt in bionic and older, there was no support for running
both agent monitor jobs and normal monitor jobs at the same.
Support for doing so was introduced in the following commit:
https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/commit/4621350f6d3dbca57bbd97829ff5d4efc3a51c97
As such, it would not appear that a malicious guest agent would
be able to block jobs in bionic and earlier, so marking as
not-affected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2020-03-04 05:42:42 UTC  ``` rh#1809740  A flaw was found in the way Libvirtd daemon issued the 'suspend' command to a QEMU guest-agent running inside a guest. It holds a monitor job while issuing the 'suspend' command to a guest-agent. A malicious guest-agent may use this flaw to block the Libvirt daemon indefinitely resulting in a DoS scenario.  Upstream patch: -> <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commitdiff;h=a663a860819287e041c3de672aad1d8543098ecc>  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1809740> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-20485> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c1)  James Fehlig   2020-03-04 15:18:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alexander Bergmann from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c0)) > rh#1809740 >  > A flaw was found in the way Libvirtd daemon issued the 'suspend' command to > a QEMU guest-agent running inside a guest.

AFAICT, suspend is just one of the operations. There's also shutdown, reboot, set time, fsinfo, and GetGuestInfo  <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2019-December/msg00295.html>  Are those fixes needed as well? I see the RH bug only mentions suspend, perhaps there are other RH bugs for the remaining operations?  All fixes are included in libvirt 6.0.0, so we have them in Factory and SLE15 SP2. How far back do you want the fix(es)? Is 12SP5/15SP1 enough? From the RH bug it appears they are going to forgo fixing older RHEL, hopefully we can do the same. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c2)  James Fehlig   2020-03-10 15:41:11 UTC  ``` Ping! Can anyone answer my questions in #1? Thanks! ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c3)  Alexander Bergmann   2020-04-15 15:04:49 UTC  ``` Hi James, thanks for checking in-depth here.  Yes, it looks like the other operations are also affected, but there are no CVEs assigned. I would suggest to include all fixes in this series and reference it inside this bug report and the changelog entry.    qemu: don't take agent and monitor job for shutdown   qemu: don't hold a monitor and agent job for reboot   qemu: don't hold both jobs for suspend   qemu: don't hold monitor and agent job when setting time   qemu: don't hold monitor job for fsinfo   qemu: don't hold monitor job for GetGuestInfo()  To answer your second question, which code streams need to be fixed. The answer is quite simple. All that are affected by this. We can however argue that a backport to older versions is not doable, if the code change is to massive and would result in new problems. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c5)  James Fehlig   2020-04-22 20:59:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alexander Bergmann from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c3)) > Hi James, thanks for checking in-depth here.  After checking again it is obvious I didn't check in depth earlier :-).  > Yes, it looks like the other operations are also affected, but there are no > CVEs assigned. I would suggest to include all fixes in this series and > reference it inside this bug report and the changelog entry.  IMO it is difficult to classify these issues as CVEs.  >   qemu: don't take agent and monitor job for shutdown  Eric Blake even responded to this one claiming it was *not* a CVE  <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2019-December/msg00313.html>  >   qemu: don't hold a monitor and agent job for reboot >   qemu: don't hold both jobs for suspend >   qemu: don't hold monitor and agent job when setting time  The same argument can be used for these ones.  >   qemu: don't hold monitor job for fsinfo >   qemu: don't hold monitor job for GetGuestInfo()  These patches were never committed  <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2019-December/msg00849.html> <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2019-December/msg00850.html>  > To answer your second question, which code streams need to be fixed. The > answer is quite simple. All that are affected by this. We can however argue > that a backport to older versions is not doable, if the code change is to > massive and would result in new problems.  I question whether these are worth backporting to anything. How can someone with equivalent of root privileges causing DoS be considered a CVE? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c6)  James Fehlig   2020-07-01 21:44:05 UTC  ``` Any news here? Can we just close this bug as WONTFIX? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c7)  James Fehlig   2021-02-17 04:32:23 UTC  ``` This has sat idle for quite some time. I'm closing as WONTFIX. See #5. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1165616#c10)  Marcus Meissner   2021-09-21 09:28:09 UTC  ``` i think we can agree with the logic, and declared it disputed.  we will not fix this issue, as this requires privileges which can cause easier denial of service. ``` |  |
