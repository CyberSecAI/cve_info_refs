RELATED: CVE-2019-20644
```

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected product:**
*   RAX40, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.62

**Impact of exploitation:** Execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vector:** The advisory does not specify the exact attack vector. However, it is a stored XSS vulnerability, implying that the attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server (e.g., in a database or configuration file) and then executed when a user views the affected page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) and user interaction (UI:R). An attacker with high privileges can inject the malicious script and the user needs to interact with the injected script for it to be executed.
