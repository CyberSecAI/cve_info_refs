- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `GetPayload` function within the `GPMF_mp4reader.c` file at line 62. This is due to a read operation exceeding the allocated buffer size.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The heap overflow can lead to a crash of the application and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of the application, if exploited further.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted MP4 file to the `gpmf-parser` utility. The provided `poc3.zip` contains a sample file that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application. This could be via command-line argument or another input method that the `gpmf-parser` reads from.
