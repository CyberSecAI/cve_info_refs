Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the referenced pull requests:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Prepared Report file attachments not being private. This means that these attachments were potentially accessible to unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Access:** Prepared report file attachments were not properly secured, leading to potential unauthorized access.
- **Lack of Access Control:** Insufficient access controls were implemented to restrict access to these sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** Unauthorized users could potentially gain access to sensitive information contained within the prepared reports.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exposure of confidential data leading to potential loss of trust and other damages.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **Direct Access:** Attackers could directly access the files if the URL was known or could be guessed.
- **Indirect Access:** Potentially, the files could be exposed through other vulnerabilities. However, the provided content does not specify how exactly the files were accessed, just that they were not made private.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of File Location:** Attackers would likely need to know the location of the prepared report file attachments. This could involve knowledge of the URL scheme or other means of locating the files.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability was due to the lack of access controls, so an attacker wouldn't need to have a valid account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves making all prepared report file attachments private, which means they are no longer publicly accessible.
- The fix was backported to the `version-11-hotfix` branch as well, indicating that the vulnerability was present in the older version.
- The pull requests indicate that the issue is a security fix, further emphasizing the seriousness of the vulnerability.
- The pull requests also mentions that the conversation is locked and limited to collaborators implying that this issue was treated with importance and kept away from public discussions after the fix was in place.
