Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an authorization flaw in the mail server configuration testing service of ManageEngine Remote Access Plus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Users with "Guest" privileges, which are intended to be read-only, are able to access and utilize the mail server configuration testing service. This violates the principle of least privilege.
- **Abuse of Service:** The mail server testing service can be abused to perform unauthorized network and port scans.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Guest users can extract credential details (name, type, username, domain/workgroup) from the credential manager (excluding the password itself)
- **Network Reconnaissance:** The vulnerability allows an attacker with "Guest" access to perform network and port scans on the local host or other systems within the same network segment. This can be leveraged to gather information about the target network for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the system running the vulnerable ManageEngine Remote Access Plus instance.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid "Guest" level login credentials to the Remote Access Plus application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege Access:** The attacker requires a low privileged "Guest" account on the Remote Access Plus application.
- **Network Connectivity:**  The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Remote Access Plus server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Dominique Righetto.
- The vulnerability was fixed in build 100450 for Remote Access Plus on-prem and on Sep 29, 2020 for Remote Access Plus Cloud.
