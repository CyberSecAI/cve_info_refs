Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Proxyman Helper Tool (PrivilegedHelperTools) uses the `EvenBetterAuthorizationSample` code, which doesn't validate the codesign of incoming `NSXPCConnection`. This allows any application to connect to the Helper Tool and potentially perform privileged actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Connection Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper validation of the origin of `NSXPCConnection` to the Helper Tool. The Helper Tool does not verify if the connecting application is indeed the legitimate Proxyman application.
*   **Unrestricted Access to Privileged Actions:** Due to the missing validation, any application can potentially send commands to the Helper Tool and perform actions that require elevated privileges, such as changing the system proxy settings.
*   **Reused Vulnerable Code:** The application reuses code from Apple's `EvenBetterAuthorizationSample` without implementing proper security hardening which results in inheriting the vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Proxy Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the system proxy settings through a malicious application.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Modifying proxy settings could allow an attacker to redirect network traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or gain further access to sensitive information.
*   **Unintended System Changes:** Malicious applications could also abuse the vulnerability to perform other unintended system changes that are facilitated by the helper tool.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Application Exploitation:** A malicious application running on the same system as Proxyman can establish an `NSXPCConnection` to the Helper Tool.
*   **Abuse of Helper Tool's Exported Protocol:** Any application that knows the exported protocol of the Helper Tool can initiate a connection and send commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to run a malicious application on the same system where Proxyman and its Helper Tool are installed.
*   **Knowledge of Helper Tool's Protocol:** The attacker needs to be aware of the exported protocol to be able to interact with the Helper Tool.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content explicitly mentions that this vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-13013, which affected Little Snitch, further strengthening the analysis.
* The issue was addressed in Proxyman version 1.12.0 by validating the codesign of incoming connections.
