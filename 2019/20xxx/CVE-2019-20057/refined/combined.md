## Description

![@NghiaTranUIT](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5878421?u=c23cdfcbee134a4cd1cc283f4c31a9f76895c6d0&v=4&size=48)[NghiaTranUIT](https://github.com/NghiaTranUIT)opened [on Dec 29, 2019](https://github.com/ProxymanApp/Proxyman/issues/364#issue-543316658)
## üê∂ Brief

There is a report from a dedicated user that Proxyman Helper Tool (PrivilegedHelperTools)could be exploited to change the System Proxy from unsigned apps.

Basically, it's the same issue with [Little Snitch CVE-2019-13013](https://blog.obdev.at/what-we-have-learned-from-a-vulnerability/) since Proxyman and Little Snitch use a same [EvenBetterAuthorizationSample](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/EvenBetterAuthorizationSample/Introduction/Intro.html) and we don't validate the codesign of incoming NSXPCConnection.

EvenBetterAuthorizationSample does good job to demonstrate how to install/uninstall the Help Tool and provide a mechanism to verify which app is authorized to do it. However, it doesn't validate the authenticity of the connections.

As a result, Any apps could exploited by sending the connection to Helper Tool, which has the same ExportProtocol.

We should fix it

## üëë Criteria

* Validate the codesign of connections before performing any System Change
* Make sure one Helper Tool could verify and accept the Proxyman's Connection.
* Use POC sample code to verify that the new Helper Tool will reject the unauthorized connections
