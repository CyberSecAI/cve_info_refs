    "summary": "The provided content discusses CVE-2019-20218, a vulnerability in SQLite related to parsing errors and handling of the WITH stack, which could lead to a crash. The vulnerability is triggered when a parsing error occurs but the WITH stack unwinding process continues, resulting in a potential denial of service. The fix includes preventing the unwinding of the WITH stack after a parsing error occurs.",
