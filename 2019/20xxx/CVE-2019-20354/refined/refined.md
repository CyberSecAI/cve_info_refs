Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20354

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `file` parameter of the `/api/settings/log` endpoint within the piSignage web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application does not sufficiently validate the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:**  A low-privilege authenticated attacker can download arbitrary files from the Raspberry Pi where piSignage is installed. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive system files, configuration files, or application data.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  The attacker needs to be authenticated to the piSignage web application with low privilege.
2.  The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the `/api/settings/log` endpoint.
3.  The malicious request contains the `file` parameter with path traversal characters, such as `../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.
4.  The server retrieves and sends the contents of the requested file back to the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs valid credentials for a low privilege user account on the piSignage application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the piSignage server.
