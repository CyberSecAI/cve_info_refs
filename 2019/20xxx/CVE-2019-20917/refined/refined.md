Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20917:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `mysql` module in InspIRCd, when built against `mariadb-connector-c` version 3.0.5 or newer, contains a null pointer dereference. This occurs because the MySQL library is not properly initialized and deallocated, leading to a crash when the module is used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference in the `mysql` module.
- Improper initialization and deallocation of the MySQL library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). A remote attacker can crash the InspIRCd server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via the `sqlauth` or `sqloper` modules. Any user able to connect to the server can trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts authentication via sqlauth or performs an action via sqloper.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to connect to the InspIRCd server.
- The attacker needs no special privileges, any user can trigger it with an authentication request via sqlauth or a command with sqloper.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `src/modules/extra/m_mysql.cpp` file.
- The fix involves properly initializing the MySQL library using `mysql_library_init()` during module initialization and deallocating it using `mysql_library_end()` during module destruction.
- The issue affects all versions of InspIRCd v2 before v2.0.28 and v3 before v3.3.0.
- Patches were released in versions 2.0.28 and 3.3.0.
- If upgrading is not possible, the `mysql` module should be unloaded as a workaround.
