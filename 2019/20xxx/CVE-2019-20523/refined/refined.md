The provided content describes multiple Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in ilchCMS version 2.1.23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `Link`, `Name`, and `Banner` parameters within the `/index.php/partner/index` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the `Link`, `Name`, and `Banner` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Stealing sensitive user information

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious code injected into the `Link`, `Name`, or `Banner` parameters through a POST request to `/index.php/partner/index`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft a malicious HTTP POST request.
- No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker must induce a user to trigger the crafted request.
