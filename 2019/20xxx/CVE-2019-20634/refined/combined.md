Response to CVE-2019-20364
# Response to CVE-2019-20364

### Response to CVE-2019-20634

Advisory ID: PFPT-SN-2020-0001

### Summary

On 3/30/2020 NIST published CVE-2019-20634 stating that:

*"By collecting scores from Proofpoint email headers, it is possible to build a copy-cat Machine Learning Classification model and extract insights from this model. The insights gathered allow an attacker to craft emails that receive preferable scores, with a goal of delivering malicious emails."*

The following document describes Proofpoint’s response to this publication, including critical clarifications, impact to customers, and mitigations customers can implement.

The specific detection engine cited in the research (MLX) is a spam detection engine that is commonly used in conjunction with Proofpoint’s Stateful Composite Scoring Service (SCSS) as part of Proofpoint Email Protection. The newer SCSS engine updates its scoring model in real-time and uniquely per recipient, and thus is not susceptible to the batch reverse-engineering technique described in the research. Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) is not impacted, nor are any other Proofpoint products. It is also important to note that the MLX scoring engine and scores modeled by this research are only used for spam detection, and are not used for detection or blocking of viruses or malware. Additionally, the “mlxlogscore” score which was modeled is an interim score in the MLX engine and is not used directly in the product for spam blocking.

To obtain favorable spam scores this tactic assumes the following:

| Assumption | Key Details |
| --- | --- |
| **No active updating of spam rules by Proofpoint** | Proofpoint updates spam rules every 5 minutes |
| **Allow for bounce messages to be created by (non-Proofpoint) downstream systems for invalid message recipients** | Best practice configurations recommend to configure the Recipient Verification feature of the Proofpoint Email Protection product to prevent this from occurring. |
| **Are using the MLX engine as the only form of spam detection** | Proofpoint takes an ensembled detection approach to protect customers. The vast majority of Proofpoint customers leverage the real-time SCSS engine in addition for spam detection. |

### Revised CVSS Score

Base Score: 3.7 (Low)

Temporal Score: 3.5 (Low)

Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:T/RC:C

### Affected versions / products

All Proofpoint Email Protection versions are impacted. Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) is not impacted.

### Recommended mitigations

Ensure you have a recent health check to ensure optimal system performance. If you have concerns or questions on the following recommendations, please contact your Proofpoint representative to obtain a free health check of current configured products.

#### Recommended: Configure Recipient Verification

As noted above, properly configured Recipient Verification will ensure that messages to invalid recipients are not delivered to downstream mail servers and will not generate “bounce” messages with X-Proofpoint-Spam-Details headers. The following articles describe how to configure this feature, and Proofpoint Support and/or Professional Services can assist in configuration if desired.

https://proofpointcommunities.force.com/community/s/article/Video-How-to-create-a-recipient-verification-block

https://proofpointcommunities.force.com/community/s/article/Recipient-Verification-How-to-enable-and-how-to-trace-in-the-logs

#### Optional: Modify Spam Policies to not add X-Proofpoint-Spam-Details headers

Customers may also modify spam policies to not add the X-Proofpoint-Spam-Details header to any message. This header is predominantly used by customers for visibility into scoring results in downstream services, and removing it has no impact on product effectiveness or core functionality.

Response to CVE-2019-20364
# Response to CVE-2019-20364

### Response to CVE-2019-20634

Advisory ID: PFPT-SN-2020-0001

### Summary

On 3/30/2020 NIST published CVE-2019-20634 stating that:

*"By collecting scores from Proofpoint email headers, it is possible to build a copy-cat Machine Learning Classification model and extract insights from this model. The insights gathered allow an attacker to craft emails that receive preferable scores, with a goal of delivering malicious emails."*

The following document describes Proofpoint’s response to this publication, including critical clarifications, impact to customers, and mitigations customers can implement.

The specific detection engine cited in the research (MLX) is a spam detection engine that is commonly used in conjunction with Proofpoint’s Stateful Composite Scoring Service (SCSS) as part of Proofpoint Email Protection. The newer SCSS engine updates its scoring model in real-time and uniquely per recipient, and thus is not susceptible to the batch reverse-engineering technique described in the research. Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) is not impacted, nor are any other Proofpoint products. It is also important to note that the MLX scoring engine and scores modeled by this research are only used for spam detection, and are not used for detection or blocking of viruses or malware. Additionally, the “mlxlogscore” score which was modeled is an interim score in the MLX engine and is not used directly in the product for spam blocking.

To obtain favorable spam scores this tactic assumes the following:

| Assumption | Key Details |
| --- | --- |
| **No active updating of spam rules by Proofpoint** | Proofpoint updates spam rules every 5 minutes |
| **Allow for bounce messages to be created by (non-Proofpoint) downstream systems for invalid message recipients** | Best practice configurations recommend to configure the Recipient Verification feature of the Proofpoint Email Protection product to prevent this from occurring. |
| **Are using the MLX engine as the only form of spam detection** | Proofpoint takes an ensembled detection approach to protect customers. The vast majority of Proofpoint customers leverage the real-time SCSS engine in addition for spam detection. |

### Revised CVSS Score

Base Score: 3.7 (Low)

Temporal Score: 3.5 (Low)

Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:T/RC:C

### Affected versions / products

All Proofpoint Email Protection versions are impacted. Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) is not impacted.

### Recommended mitigations

Ensure you have a recent health check to ensure optimal system performance. If you have concerns or questions on the following recommendations, please contact your Proofpoint representative to obtain a free health check of current configured products.

#### Recommended: Configure Recipient Verification

As noted above, properly configured Recipient Verification will ensure that messages to invalid recipients are not delivered to downstream mail servers and will not generate “bounce” messages with X-Proofpoint-Spam-Details headers. The following articles describe how to configure this feature, and Proofpoint Support and/or Professional Services can assist in configuration if desired.

https://proofpointcommunities.force.com/community/s/article/Recipient-Verification-How-to-enable-and-how-to-trace-in-the-logs

#### Optional: Modify Spam Policies to not add X-Proofpoint-Spam-Details headers

Customers may also modify spam policies to not add the X-Proofpoint-Spam-Details header to any message. This header is predominantly used by customers for visibility into scoring results in downstream services, and removing it has no impact on product effectiveness or core functionality.

# Proof Pudding (CVE-2019-20634)

This repository contains the code from our ([Will Pearce](https://twitter.com/moo_hax)/[Nick Landers](https://twitter.com/monoxgas)) 2019 DerbyCon presentation **"42: The answer to life, the universe, and everything offensive security"**. It is designed to attack ProofPoint's e-mail scoring system by stealing scored datasets (`core/data/*.csv`) and creating a copy-cat model for abuse. Before diving in, we'd recommend watching the **[presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsvkYoxtexQ)**, or browse the **[slides here](https://github.com/moohax/Talks/blob/master/slides/DerbyCon19.pdf)**.

The project core is built on Python3 + Keras. It includes the stolen pre-scored datasets, pre-trained models (`./models/*`), and extracted insights (`./results/*`) from our research. It also exposes functionality for training, scoring, and reversing insights yourself.

## Training

Training is performed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) + Bag of Words tokenizing. We target the `mlxlogscore` for loss, which is generally a value between 1-999, with higher values representing "safer" samples.

We've provided pre-trained models if you are reading this on a potato:

* `./models/texts.h5`
* `./models/links.h5`

To train your own model on link-based samples:

```
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
> python proofpudding.py train -d links ./models/my_link_model.h5

  ...

Epoch 8/10
10398/10398 [==============================] - 3s 298us/step - loss: 0.0428
Epoch 9/10
10398/10398 [==============================] - 3s 297us/step - loss: 0.0387
Epoch 10/10
10398/10398 [==============================] - 3s 295us/step - loss: 0.0369
2600/2600 [==============================] - 1s 271us/step

[+] Mean score error: 46

[+] Saved model to ./models/my_link_model.h5
[+] Saved vocab to ./models/my_link_model.h5.vocab

```

For text-based samples:

```
> python proofpudding.py train -d texts ./models/my_text_model.h5

```

The vocabulary for each model will be stored at `{model_file}.vocab`, and is required for performing scoring or insights. The performance of each model is measured in mean absolute error (MAE), which can effectively be converted into a "Mean Score Error", describing the mean average # of points we were off. The final measurement is taken from a split validation set of 20% by default.

To speed up training, we would recommend installing `tensorflow-gpu`.

## Scoring

With trained models, we can quickly score any sample to predict it's performance in the real world before delivery. Remember, you'll need to match your sample type (link or email) with a model which was trained on the correct data type (`-d`).

```
> python proofpudding.py score -m ./models/texts.h5 email.text
  ...

  [+] Predicted Score: 670

> python proofpudding.py score -m ./models/my_link_model.h5 http://link.com/file.txt
  ...

  [+] Predicted Score: 892

```

## Insights

During our research, we also created a basic approach to "reversing" the copy-cat model, attempting to list the highest and lowest scoring tokens. To do this, we take every sample and toggle any tokens which exist from `1` to `0`, then rescore the sample. We track the rolling score movement for each token, and divide it by the number of samples it appeared in.

If you'd like to extract them yourself:

```
> python proofpudding.py insights -m ./models/my_link_model.h5 -d links ./results/my_results.csv

```

Using our pre-trained models, we've also pre-extracted insights for you:

* `./results/text_insights.csv`
* `./results/link_insights.csv`

**Here is a snippet of them:**

Good Link tokens: `category, title, song, depositphotos, archive`
*Bad* Link tokens: `wp, plugins, speadsheet, secret, battle, dispatch`

Good Text tokens: `gerald, thanks, fax, questions, blackberry`
*Bad* Text tokens: `gmt, image, home, payroll, xls, calendars, mr`

## Notes

* Proofpoint describe in their documentation that they have a model per client, so results for a law firm might be different than a hospital. However, it is unlikely Proofpoint trains a model for each client, ratherm, they probably fine-tune a larger, more general model.
* Each time the model is trained, results and insights will be slightly different - but should be similar across a number of training runs.
* There is some dead code that we'll revive at some point.
