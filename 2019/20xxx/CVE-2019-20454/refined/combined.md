# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-08-01 01:28:16 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in libpcre. A buffer overread in JIT mode when \X is used in non-UTF mode may cause application crash and denial of service. The flaw is in function do_extuni_no_utf() in pcre2_jit_compile.c, which uses the macro GETCHARINC to read a character. However, in case there is an invalid UTF character the value read is too big, which causes an out-of-bounds read in the next statement, while executing macro UCD_GRAPHBREAK.

Upstream's fix is at <<https://vcs.pcre.org/pcre2?view=revision&revision=1092>>. Tests are added in <<https://vcs.pcre.org/pcre2?view=revision&revision=1091>>.  Moreover, this bug hardly can be embargoed as it was publicly reported to upstream on 2019-07-28 and the fix is publicly available since 2019-05-13.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c2)  Joshua Padman    2019-08-12 02:29:41 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following products:  * Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Server 2  * Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3   * Red Hat JBoss Core Services  Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes> for more details.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-14 10:59:04 UTC  ``` The flaw can be triggered only when JIT and non-UTF-8 mode is used.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-14 11:02:29 UTC  ``` PHP in RHEL 8 sets pcre.jit=0 in /etc/php.ini by default, so unless the user changes that setting, the flaw cannot be triggered.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-14 11:04:49 UTC  ``` Only php:7.3/php in RHEL 8 is affected by this flaw, while php:7.2/php is not because it embeds an older version of pcre, which does not contain the vulnerable code.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c7)  Petr Pisar    2020-02-14 11:45:25 UTC  ``` There is already a pcre2 RHEL-8 [bug #1734468](show_bug.cgi?id=1734468) for this issue.

Option PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE shall be passed to pcre2_jit_compile. Assuming the pattern is hard-coded in an application, an attacker just needs control over the subject to trigger the flaw, which would cause a crash in the application.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c11)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-14 15:43:12 UTC  ``` Created glib2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1803178](show_bug.cgi?id=1803178 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2019-20454 glib2: pcre: out-of-bounds read in JIT mode when \X is used in non-UTF mode [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-glib2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1803179](show_bug.cgi?id=1803179 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2019-20454 mingw-glib2: pcre: out-of-bounds read in JIT mode when \X is used in non-UTF mode [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-pcre tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1803177](show_bug.cgi?id=1803177 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-20454 mingw-pcre: pcre: out-of-bounds read in JIT mode when \X is used in non-UTF mode [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-pcre2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1803181](show_bug.cgi?id=1803181 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-20454 mingw-pcre2: pcre: out-of-bounds read in JIT mode when \X is used in non-UTF mode [fedora-all]")]   Created pcre tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1803176](show_bug.cgi?id=1803176 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2019-20454 pcre: out-of-bounds read in JIT mode when \X is used in non-UTF mode [fedora-all]")]   Created pcre2 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1803180](show_bug.cgi?id=1803180 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-20454 pcre2: pcre: out-of-bounds read in JIT mode when \X is used in non-UTF mode [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c12)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-14 16:18:24 UTC  ``` rh-php73-php as shipped in Red Hat Software Collections 3.4 ships php-7.3.11 right now, which already fixes this flaw.

In my opinion it is not.  Please close the bug as NOTABUG then. We do not check all packages in Fedora and we often create trackers to let the maintainers know about the possible issue. They should know whether that applies to their packages or not and they can quickly close the opened bug if it does not apply, such as in this case probably.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-09-08 09:46:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:3662 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3662](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3662)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1735494#c19)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-09-08 13:18:10 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Package        : pcre2
Version        : 10.32-5+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-20454 CVE-2022-1586 CVE-2022-1587
Debian Bug     : 1011954

Multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities were found in pcre2, a Perl
Compatible Regular Expression library, which could result in information
disclosure or denial or service.

CVE-2019-20454

    Out-of-bounds read when the pattern \X is JIT compiled and used to
    match specially crafted subjects in non-UTF mode.

CVE-2022-1586

    Out-of-bounds read involving unicode property matching in
    JIT-compiled regular expressions. The issue occurs because the
    character was not fully read in case-less matching within JIT.

CVE-2022-1587

    Out-of-bounds read affecting recursions in JIT-compiled regular
    expressions caused by duplicate data transfers.

This upload also fixes a subject buffer overread in JIT when UTF is
disabled and \X or \R has a greater than 1 fixed quantifier. This issue
was found by Yunho Kim.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
10.32-5+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pcre2 packages.

For the detailed security status of pcre2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pcre2>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-b11cf352bd
2020-07-09 01:05:44.962939
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : mingw-pcre2
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 10.33
Release : 3.fc31
URL : <http://www.pcre.org/>
Summary : MinGW Windows pcre2 library
Description :
Cross compiled Perl-compatible regular expression library for use with mingw32.

PCRE has its own native API, but a set of "wrapper" functions that are based on
the POSIX API are also supplied in the library libpcreposix. Note that this
just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE: the regular expressions
themselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The header file
for the POSIX-style functions is called pcreposix.h.
