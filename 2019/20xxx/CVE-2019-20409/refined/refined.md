The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20409.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center used Velocity templates prior to version 8.8.0. This insecure implementation allowed for remote code execution if a server-side template injection vulnerability could be exploited.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploiting a server-side template injection vulnerability in the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject malicious code into a Velocity template processed by the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to find an entry point that allows template injection.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue is considered a security improvement in later versions rather than a directly exploitable vulnerability. The fix makes it harder to exploit potential SSTI in the future, but the described vulnerability would exist in earlier versions if a template injection point were found.
- A workaround is provided involving replacing the vulnerable libraries with updated versions from Jira 8.12. This workaround may cause issues with third-party plugins.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Jira version 8.8.0.
