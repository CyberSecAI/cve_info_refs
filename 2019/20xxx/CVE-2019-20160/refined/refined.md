Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow
*   **Location:** `media_tools/av_parsers.c:3845` in the `av1_parse_tile_group` function.
*   **Root Cause:** A write operation in the `av1_parse_tile_group` function overflows a stack buffer. The ASAN output shows that the memory access at offset 35160 overflows the 'state' variable.
*   **Impact:** Segmentation fault, program crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted AV1 bitstream via the MP4Box tool.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious AV1 file that triggers the overflow when processed by MP4Box.
*   **Affected versions:** The issue exists in versions 0.8.0 and 0.9.0.
