Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks when handling requests to modify the JMX monitoring flag in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application does not adequately validate the origin of requests that modify the JMX monitoring flag, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can remotely toggle the JMX monitoring flag (either on or off).
*   Although the severity is rated as "low," this could potentially impact monitoring and management of the Jira instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is executed via a crafted malicious web page or link that an authenticated Jira user visits. The malicious request is then sent to the Jira server without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated Jira user into visiting a malicious web page or clicking a malicious link.
*   The user must be logged into Jira for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Jira Server and Data Center versions prior to 8.6.0.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a low severity.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 8.6.0
