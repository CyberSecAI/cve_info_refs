# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2019-20366 – Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in Openfire Product

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### Openfire

#### Affected Product

##### Ignite Realtime

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20366

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-12-1036

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### December 31, 2019

### Description

A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack can cause arbitrary code (javascript) to run in a userâs browser while the browser is connected to a trusted web site. The application targets your applicationâs users and not the application itself, but it uses your application as the vehicle for the attack. XSS payload is executed whenever the user submits the crafted POST request with XSS Payload in Openfire 4.4.4 Product.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on Openfire version 4.4.4 Product.

Issue 01: The GET Request âisTrustStoreâ variable in the URL http://localhost:9090/security-certificate-details.jsp?connectionType=SOCKET\_S2S&alias=TEST-103 \_rsa&isTrustStore=false are failing to validate XSS payload in client side which results in reflected cross site scripting.

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure 01:* *IsTrustStore value is reflected inside a tag parameter between double quotes (here isTrustStore is âreflected XSSâ).***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure 02:* *Add XSS payload to the variable âisTrustStore.â***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure 03:* *HTTP Response for the modified âisTrustStoreâ variable with XSS payload.***

![](data:image/png;base64...)

***Figure 04:* *Injected XSS payload, “onmouseover=alert(/xss/)// gets reflected in the browser response.***

### Impact

* Stealing cookies
* End-user files disclosure.
* Redirection of the user to some other page or site.

### Remediations

Perform context-sensitive encoding of untrusted input before it is echoed back to a browser by using an encoding library. Implement input validation for special characters on all the variables that are reflecting to the browser and storing it in the database. Implement client-side validation.

### Timeline

**Dec 31, 2019:**Â Discovered inÂ Openfire product.
