The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2019-20767, it does describe a vulnerability, its impact, and affected devices, which is similar to a CVE description. Given the content's focus on a post-authentication stack overflow on multiple router models, and the lack of a specified CVE, this is likely relevant to a broad class of vulnerabilities, which would include CVE-2019-20767 if it involves post-authentication stack overflows in Netgear routers.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A post-authentication stack overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow, which can be triggered after authentication.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The advisory states that the vulnerability can lead to high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability of the device (C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, i.e. the attacker must be on the same network (AV:A).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to authenticate to the router (PR:H - high privileges), and does not require user interaction (UI:N).

The advisory lists the affected products and firmware versions:

*   D6100, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.60
*   D3600, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.75
*   D6000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.75
*   R9000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.26
*   R8900, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.26
*   R7800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.52
*   WNDR4500v3, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.58
*   WNDR4300v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.58
*   WNDR4300, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.104
*   WNDR3700v4, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.102
*  WNR2000v5, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.66

The advisory also provides instructions on how to download the latest firmware to mitigate the vulnerability.
