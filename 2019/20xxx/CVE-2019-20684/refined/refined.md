The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Vulnerability:** Pre-authentication stack overflow.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected devices without authentication.
*   **Attack Vector:** The advisory doesn't explicitly detail the attack vector, but it being pre-authentication suggests that the vulnerability is reachable without needing to log in.
*   **Affected Devices:**
    *   D3600, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.75
    *   D6000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.75
    *   D6200, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.00.32
    *   D7000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.68
    *   JR6150, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.18
    *   PR2000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.28
    *   R6020, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.38
    *   R6050, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.18
    *   R6080, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.38
    *   R6120, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.46
    *   R6220, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.80
    *   R6260, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.40
    *   R6700v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.36
    *   R6800, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.36
    *   R6900v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.36
    *   WNR2020, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.62
    *   XR500, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.2.32
*   **Root Cause:** Stack overflow.
*   **Mitigation:** NETGEAR recommends updating to the latest firmware.
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.8 (High)
    *   CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

    *   **AV:A** (Attack Vector: Adjacent)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   **PR:N** (Privileges Required: None)
    *   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
    *   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   **C:H** (Confidentiality: High)
    *   **I:H** (Integrity: High)
    *   **A:H** (Availability: High)

The advisory specifies an attack vector of "Adjacent", meaning an attacker needs to be on the same physical or logical network segment as the vulnerable device.
