The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Vera platform: a stored XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-20483) and an improper access control vulnerability (CVE-2019-20484). This analysis focuses on the latter, CVE-2019-20484.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper access control in the projects module. The application fails to properly validate user permissions before allowing access to project resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient access control: The system does not prevent users from accessing project data and functionality even when their permissions to access projects have been explicitly revoked.
- Lack of authorization checks: The application allows access to project resources based on the URL of the project, without checking if the user has the necessary permissions to access that particular resource.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive project documents.
- Ability to upload content to projects without proper authorization.
- A malicious user could potentially view, download, and manipulate project-related data that they are not intended to access, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized changes, and other security issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct URL manipulation: An attacker can access project resources by directly navigating to the project URL, bypassing the intended permission checks.
- After gaining unauthorized access, they can interact with the project as if they had the correct permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs a valid user account on the Vera platform.
- They require basic knowledge about where the project resources are located in order to access them directly.
- The attacker has to know the URL of a project that they should not have access to.
