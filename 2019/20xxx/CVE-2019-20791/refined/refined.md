The provided content relates to commits in the `openthread/openthread` repository, specifically focusing on changes to the `src/core/meshcop/commissioner.cpp` file. These commits address a potential vulnerability related to the handling of network names and passphrases when generating a Pre-Shared Key for a Commissioner (PSKc). The relevant commit messages and code diffs indicate that these commits are likely related to CVE-2019-20791.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and the fix:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The original code used `strlen` to determine the length of the network name and passphrases without proper bounds checking. If a network name or passphrase was not null-terminated (or was longer than the maximum allowed length), `strlen` could read beyond the allocated buffer leading to a potential buffer overflow read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow Read:** Using `strlen` on potentially unterminated strings or strings exceeding their maximum allowed length could lead to out-of-bounds reads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

While the content doesn't specify the exact impact, a buffer overflow read could:
- Potentially leak sensitive information from memory.
- Possibly lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted network name or passphrase that is not null-terminated or exceeds the maximum allowed size.
- This can be achieved by a malicious actor interacting with the commissioner during the commissioning process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to be in a position to supply network names and passphrases, which usually occurs during the device commissioning process for an OpenThread network.

**Fix:**

The vulnerability is addressed in two commits:

1. **Commit `b8c3161`:** This commit added a length check for `aNetworkName` using `strlen`.
   ```diff
   -  VerifyOrExit((strlen(aPassPhrase) >= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MIN_SIZE) &&
   -              (strlen(aPassPhrase) <= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MAX_SIZE),
   +  VerifyOrExit((strlen(aPassPhrase) >= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MIN_SIZE) &&
   +             (strlen(aPassPhrase) <= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MAX_SIZE) &&
   +             (strlen(aNetworkName) <= OT_NETWORK_NAME_MAX_SIZE),
   ```
   This commit addresses the missing check for `aNetworkName` length, but is insufficient by itself.

2. **Commit `c3a3a0c`:** This commit replaces `strlen` with `strnlen` to prevent reading beyond the maximum allowed length when getting the passphrase and network name lengths, ensuring the lengths are within the bounds.
  ```diff
  - VerifyOrExit((strlen(aPassPhrase) >= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MIN_SIZE) &&
  -            (strlen(aPassPhrase) <= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MAX_SIZE) &&
  -            (strlen(aNetworkName) <= OT_NETWORK_NAME_MAX_SIZE),
  +    uint16_t passphraseLen;
  +    uint8_t networkNameLen;
  +
  +    passphraseLen = static_cast<uint16_t>(strnlen(aPassPhrase, OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MAX_SIZE + 1));
  +    networkNameLen = static_cast<uint8_t>(strnlen(aNetworkName, OT_NETWORK_NAME_MAX_SIZE + 1));
  +
  +    VerifyOrExit((passphraseLen >= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MIN_SIZE) &&
  +               (passphraseLen <= OT_COMMISSIONING_PASSPHRASE_MAX_SIZE) &&
  +               (networkNameLen <= OT_NETWORK_NAME_MAX_SIZE),
  ```
  It also changes the way the salt is generated to use the length returned by strnlen instead of strlen for both network name and salt prefix and also adds checks to ensure the lengths of `aPassPhrase` and `aNetworkName` are within their maximum allowed sizes before using them in the `otPbkdf2Cmac` function.

These two commits, particularly the second one using `strnlen`, effectively mitigate the vulnerability.
