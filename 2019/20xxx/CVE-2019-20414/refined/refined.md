- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Issue Navigator Basic Search functionality of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input in the Issue Navigator Basic Search, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the Issue Navigator Basic Search functionality. An attacker can inject malicious code by crafting a specific search query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted search query to the vulnerable Issue Navigator Basic Search interface. This would typically require network access to the Jira instance.
