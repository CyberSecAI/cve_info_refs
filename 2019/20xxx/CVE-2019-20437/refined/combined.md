# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2019-20437 – Stored Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2 Product

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### WSO2

#### Affected Product

##### See Full List Below\*

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20437

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-11-1030

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### June 29, 2019

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered on WSO2 products in the management console. A stored cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to execute the malicious codeÂ if there is a claim dialect configured with an XSS payload in the dialect URI, if a user picks up the malicious dialect URI, and adds it as the service provider claim dialect while configuring the service provider.

**\*Affected Products:** WSO2 API Manager, WSO2 API Manager Analytics, WSO2 IS as Key Manager, WSO2 Identity Server, WSO2 Identity Server Analytics

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The POST request dialect variable is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the URL, <https://localhost:9443/carbon/identity-claim-mgt/add-dialect-finish-ajaxprocessor.jsp>

***Figure 01:* *Adding XSS payload to the dialect variable.***

***Figure 02:* *Added XSS payload, <script>alert(document.cookie)</script> gets stored.***

***Figure 05:* *Add Service Provider Claim Dialect URI by selecting the stored URI value from claims.***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-6(11).png)

***Figure 06**: Injected XSS payload gets executed in the browser after adding claims.***

### Impact

Through an XSS attack, the attacker can make the browser redirect to a malicious website. Unauthorized actions such as changing the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser are possible. But since all session-related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flat and protected, session hijacking or mounting a similar attack would not be possible.

**Reproducing Steps**

1. Login to the Application
2. Go to [URL.](https://192.168.0.137:9444/carbon/idpmgt/idp-mgt-edit.jsp?region=region1&item=identity_providers_add)
3. Adding identity provider information
4. Click on Claim Configuration
5. Navigate through `Basic Claim Configuration`
6. Choose `Define Custom Claim Dialect` and `Add Claim Mapping` with XSS Payload (like, `XSS"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`)
7. Then, Navigate to `Advanced Claim Configuration`
8. Select `Claim URI` from `Provisioning Claim Filter` section.
9. Clicking on `Add claim` button reflects the stored XSS payload in the browser.
10. Similarly, the stored XSS payload gets reflected in the browser every time when the user clicks on “Add claim” button.
