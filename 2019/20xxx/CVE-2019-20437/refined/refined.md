Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20437:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the management console of WSO2 products. Specifically, the "dialect URI" field within the claim dialect configuration is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). When a user configures a claim dialect with a malicious payload within the dialect URI, this payload is stored. Subsequently, when a user selects this malicious dialect while configuring a service provider, the stored XSS payload is executed in the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts are injected into the system and then executed when a legitimate user interacts with the affected functionality.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically within the "dialect URI" field. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Website Redirection:** An attacker can use the XSS vulnerability to redirect a user's browser to a malicious website.
*   **UI Manipulation:** The attacker can alter the appearance of the webpage.
*   **Information Theft:** Sensitive information stored in the browser, including cookies, can be potentially accessed. Although httpOnly flags might mitigate some risks, other browser data could still be at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Claim Dialect Configuration:** An attacker needs to configure a claim dialect, including adding an XSS payload within the dialect URI field, typically through the administrative interface of WSO2.
*   **Service Provider Configuration:**  A user must then add a service provider and select the maliciously created claim dialect URI during configuration for the XSS payload to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the WSO2 management console to add claim dialects and configure service providers.
*   **Knowledge of Application Flow:** The attacker needs to be aware of how claim dialects and service providers are configured within WSO2 to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was discovered in WSO2 Identity Server 5.7.0 but affected other products as well: WSO2 API Manager, WSO2 API Manager Analytics, and WSO2 IS as Key Manager.
* The vulnerability was reported and fixed by WSO2. Patches were released for the affected versions.
