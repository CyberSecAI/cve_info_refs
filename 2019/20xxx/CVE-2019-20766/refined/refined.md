The provided content is related to a security advisory for a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability on the NETGEAR R7800 router, which is not CVE-2019-20766. This advisory is associated with PSV-2018-0135 and has a CVSS v3 score of 6.8.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the R7800 firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Post-authentication stack overflow. This implies the vulnerability can be triggered after a user has already authenticated to the router.

**Impact of exploitation:**

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker must be within the same network as the router to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) and needs to have already authenticated to the device. User Interaction is not required (UI:N).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects the NETGEAR R7800 router with firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.52.
- NETGEAR recommends that users update to the latest firmware to mitigate the risk.
- The advisory was published on 2019-03-11.
