The provided content is related to a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of multiple Netgear router models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited after successful authentication to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for potential arbitrary code execution on the affected devices
- Complete compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a network attack.
- Exploitation requires successful authentication to the device's web interface or other management interface.
- Attacker needs adjacent network access (AV:A)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have already authenticated to the device with valid credentials (PR:H).
- The attacker must be on the same adjacent network (AV:A) as the target device.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Affected Products:**
The advisory lists the following affected product models and firmware versions:
*   D6220, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.48
*   D6400, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.82
