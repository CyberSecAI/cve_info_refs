- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs in the `Mat_VarReadNextInfo5` function within the `mat5.c` file due to a missing bounds check when copying dimension data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow. The code copies dimension data into the `matvar->dims` buffer without checking if `j` is within the bounds of the allocated size for `matvar->dims`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A crafted input can cause a crash due to a stack buffer overflow. In a real world scenario this could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted `.mat` file can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious `.mat` file that will be processed by the vulnerable `matio` library.
