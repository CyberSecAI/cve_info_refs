Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20098

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the referrer or `atl_token` attributes in the `VerifySmtpServerConnection!add.jspa` component of Atlassian Jira. This allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery, which allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerable component doesn't properly validate the referrer or `atl_token` attributes, which are intended to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Host Enumeration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to enumerate hosts and open ports on the internal network where the Jira server is present. This is done by making the Jira server attempt connections to a range of IP addresses. By timing the response, the attacker can determine which hosts are up and listening on specified ports.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could gather information about the internal network infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to trick an administrative user into making malicious HTTP requests. This is achieved through CSRF attacks, which often involve embedding malicious requests in a web page or email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the Jira server, or have access to the Jira instance.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick an administrative user to visit a malicious webpage, which in turn would submit the forged request to the vulnerable Jira instance. The user must be logged into Jira for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center before version 8.7.0.
- The `VerifySmtpServerConnection!add.jspa` component is responsible for testing SMTP server connections.
-  The provided exploit code sends requests to the Jira server and times the response to identify available hosts.
- The vulnerability was disclosed by Tenable.
