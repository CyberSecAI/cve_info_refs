Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20403

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an API in Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to determine if a specific Jira project key exists or not. This information disclosure vulnerability arises because the API provides different responses depending on the existence of a project key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of whether a specific Jira project key exists. This information can be used by an attacker to enumerate project keys within a Jira instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Enumeration of Project Keys:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can systematically discover existing project keys within a Jira instance. This knowledge could be a stepping stone to further attacks. Although the direct impact is low, the information leaked is useful for other exploits and could reveal hidden projects.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need to have an account on the Jira instance and can exploit this vulnerability without authentication.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Jira instance and be able to send API requests.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 7.13 and fixed in versions 8.6.0 and 8.5.5
*   The severity is rated as "Severity 2 - Major" by Atlassian, but the priority is low.
*   This issue is categorized as a bug and has been assigned labels such as "advisory," "cve-2019-20403", "cvss-medium", and "information-disclosure".
*   The bug has been addressed in the Long Term Support releases.
