Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding when processing email content within the Postie WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code via crafted SVG elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue, where malicious JavaScript code can be injected through email content and then executed within a user's browser when viewing the crafted post.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sufficiently sanitize email content, particularly the body, allowing arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code to be included in posts.
- **Insufficient Output Encoding:** The plugin does not properly encode output to prevent injected scripts from executing within the context of the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a post. When a user views the post, the attacker's code will execute in the user's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user or steal sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the website, redirect users to malicious sites, or engage in other forms of website defacement.
- **Account Compromise:** If the attacker targets an administrator account, they could potentially gain full control over the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Injection:** The attacker sends a specially crafted email to the Postie-configured email address. This email contains the malicious JavaScript payload, typically embedded within an SVG element.
- **Post Creation:** The Postie plugin processes the email, creating a new post with the attacker's JavaScript.
- **User Interaction:** When a user accesses the published post, the injected JavaScript is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker must be able to send emails to the email address configured with the Postie plugin.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authenticating to the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Plugin Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the XSS vulnerability in the Postie plugin.
- **Crafting Malicious Payload:** The attacker must be able to craft the JavaScript polyglot payload that bypasses security measures.

**Technical Details:**
The provided content details the XSS payload as:
`jaVasCript:/*--></title></style></textarea></script></xmp><svg/onload='+/"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//'>`

This payload leverages a combination of techniques to bypass input sanitization, and inject malicious javascript into the context of the page by exploiting the parsing of HTML attributes within the SVG tag, specifically utilizing `onload` and `onmouseover` events.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable version is Postie WordPress plugin <v1.9.40.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) is available, demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The exploit is also listed on Exploit DB ([https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47925](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47925)).
