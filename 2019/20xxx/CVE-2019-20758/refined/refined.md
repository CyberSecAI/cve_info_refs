The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20758.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware. This vulnerability is triggered after a user has already authenticated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the device, granting the attacker full control. Specifically, the CVSS vector indicates the potential for high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be on the same network as the device (adjacent) and must have valid user credentials to trigger the buffer overflow (low privilege). The attacker needs to interact with the device (user interaction required) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected product is the NETGEAR R7000 router.
- Firmware versions prior to 1.0.9.42 are vulnerable.
- The vendor rates the severity of the vulnerability as high, with a CVSS v3 score of 8.0.
- The vendor recommends upgrading to the latest firmware.
