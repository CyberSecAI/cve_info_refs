This document describes a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability, but it is not related to CVE-2019-20731. The advisory is related to  PSV-2017-2254.

Root cause of vulnerability: A post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of multiple NETGEAR router, gateway, and extender models.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow.

Impact of exploitation: The document mentions that the vulnerability is a post-authentication issue, and can lead to unspecified consequences if not mitigated by updating the firmware. The CVSS score indicates that it could result in high confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and low availability impact.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is local (AV:L) indicating that the attacker needs local access to the device, but this does not necessarily mean physical access since the exploit can be achieved via network if the device's web interface is accessible over the network.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:H - high privileges) to the device's web interface to exploit the vulnerability. User interaction is not required (UI:N).
