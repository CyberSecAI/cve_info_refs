The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20521.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within URL parameters, which is then reflected in the application's output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in multiple URL paths of ERPNext version 11.1.47.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which will then be executed in the browser of a user who visits the crafted URL. This could lead to session hijacking, phishing, malware distribution, and defacement, among other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through manipulated URLs. The attacker crafts URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads embedded in the URI. When a victim accesses the manipulated URL, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and induce the victim to visit them. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the application.
