The provided content describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities found in Nagios 5.6.9.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input in several parameters. Specifically, the `host`, `hostgroup`, `servicegroup`, `hour`, and `frequency` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the Nagios web interface.
- The injected script would execute in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    - Deface the Nagios interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests that include malicious JavaScript code in vulnerable parameters.
- Specifically, the parameters `host`, `hostgroup`, `servicegroup`, `hour` and `frequency` are vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Nagios instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the Nagios web interface with malicious payloads embedded in the vulnerable parameters.
