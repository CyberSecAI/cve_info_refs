# Description:

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WSO2 Data Analytics Server Product. By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies which means that the malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

**Issue 1 & 2:**

Access the [URL,](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/resources/resource.jsp?region=region3&item=resource_browser_menu&path=/) and add XSS payload `xss”><script>alert(1)</script>` through vulnerable variable **path & name** to execute XSS in the POST request [URL.](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/properties/properties-ajaxprocessor.jsp)

[![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712340-a9999480-1128-11ea-99a8-5b9d7139fca1.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712340-a9999480-1128-11ea-99a8-5b9d7139fca1.png)

Figure 1: Access the [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/resources/resource.jsp?region=region3&item=resource_browser_menu&path=/)

[![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712357-b0280c00-1128-11ea-9eb1-99ed651bac9f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712357-b0280c00-1128-11ea-9eb1-99ed651bac9f.png)

Figure 2: Add new property.

[![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712387-bcac6480-1128-11ea-9d1d-f71980b772d4.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712387-bcac6480-1128-11ea-9d1d-f71980b772d4.png)

Figure 3: XSS payload added to `path` variable and gets reflected in the response.

[![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712405-c6ce6300-1128-11ea-8955-9b3c5de75089.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712405-c6ce6300-1128-11ea-8955-9b3c5de75089.png)

Figure 4: Injected XSS payload gets reflected in the browser.

Figure 5: XSS payload added to `name` variable and gets reflected in the response.

[![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712439-d77ed900-1128-11ea-88d2-0e1cd80c157a.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712439-d77ed900-1128-11ea-88d2-0e1cd80c157a.png)

Figure 6: Injected XSS payload gets reflected in the browser.

**Issue 3:**

Access the GET request [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/ndatasource/newdatasource.jsp?dsProvider=XSS%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c/script%3e&dsName=xss%22%3e&description=xss%22%3e) (added with XSS payload) directly to see XSS getting reflected in the browser.

[![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712468-e06faa80-1128-11ea-8e29-d5b52993ed1c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712468-e06faa80-1128-11ea-8e29-d5b52993ed1c.png)

Figure 7: Access the [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/ndatasource/newdatasource.jsp) to add new Data Source

[![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712503-f1202080-1128-11ea-8ee3-4b3d6d1fda65.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712503-f1202080-1128-11ea-8ee3-4b3d6d1fda65.png)

Figure 8: capturing the GET request and added XSS payload gets reflected in the response.

[![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712517-f8dfc500-1128-11ea-8275-055f1399a80b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/69712517-f8dfc500-1128-11ea-8275-055f1399a80b.png)

Figure 9: Injected XSS payload, `XSS%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c/script%3e` through vulnerable **dsProvider** gets reflected whenever the user tries to access the [URL.](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/ndatasource/newdatasource.jsp?dsProvider=XSS%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c/script%3e&dsName=xss%22%3e&description=xss%22%3e)

**Reproducing Steps**

**Issue 01 & 02:**

1. Logon into data analytics server with given credentials (admin/admin in localhost) in the [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon) (Localhost IP)
2. Now, access the [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/resources/resource.jsp?region=region3&item=resource_browser_menu&path=/)
3. Add new property and capture the request in proxy and send it to repeater.
4. Add XSS payload `xss"><script>alert(1)</script>` to **path & name** variable one by one.
5. Then, the Injected XSS Payload `xss"><script>alert(1)</script>` will get reflected in the response.

**Issue 03:**

1. Logon into data analytics server with given credentials (admin/admin in localhost) in the [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon) (Localhost IP)
2. Now, access the [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/ndatasource/newdatasource.jsp) to add new Data Source with encoded XSS payload `XSS%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c/script%3e` and submit the data which gets reflected in the browser.
3. Or access the [URL](https://192.168.0.139:9443/carbon/ndatasource/newdatasource.jsp?dsProvider=XSS%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c/script%3e&dsName=xss%22%3e&description=xss%22%3e) (added with XSS payload) directly to see XSS getting reflected in the browser.

### Impact

An attacker can trick a privileged user into clicking a crafted URL and hijacking a logged-in userâs session by stealing cookies. This means that the attacker can change the logged-in userâs password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.
