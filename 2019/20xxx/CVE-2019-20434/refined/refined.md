Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20434

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious code into the application through vulnerable parameters. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in multiple locations, allowing for the injection of script code into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the WSO2 Data Analytics Server product. Specifically, there are three reported instances of XSS:
    1.  The `path` variable in the URL `https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/properties/properties-ajaxprocessor.jsp`
    2.  The `name` variable in the URL `https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/properties/properties-ajaxprocessor.jsp`
    3.  The `dsProvider` variable in the URL `https://WSO2IP:9443/carbon/ndatasource/newdatasource.jsp`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
    - Hijack a logged-in user's session by stealing their cookies.
    - Change the logged-in user's password.
    - Invalidate the victim's session while maintaining access.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, compromise of user accounts, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET and POST requests to the specified URLs, including malicious JavaScript in the vulnerable parameters ( `path`, `name`, `dsProvider`).
- The attacker crafts URLs containing malicious JavaScript within the vulnerable parameters and tricks the user into accessing the link or submitting the manipulated forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable URLs and parameters.
- The attacker needs to trick a privileged user into accessing the malicious URL or submitting the manipulated form.
- The exploit requires that the user is authenticated in the WSO2 product.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in WSO2 Data Analytics Server Product version 3.1.0 but affects version 3.2.0 as well.
- The vendor has released a patch to address the vulnerability.
- The identified XSS vulnerabilities are categorized as reflected, meaning the malicious script is reflected back to the user from the server.
