CVE-2019-20788 is present in the analyzed documents. The following information is extracted from the analyzed documents:

*   **Vulnerability**: Integer overflow in `HandleCursorShape` leading to heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Location**: `libvncclient/cursor.c` in LibVNCServer through 0.9.12.
*   **Root Cause**: The `HandleCursorShape` function in `libvncclient/cursor.c` calculates the size of a memory allocation using `width * height * bytesPerPixel`. A malicious VNC server can provide a large `width` and `height` values, potentially causing an integer overflow and leading to a smaller than expected memory allocation. Later operations using the original `width` and `height` values can then cause a heap-based buffer overflow when writing data to the undersized buffer.
*   **Attack Vector**: A malicious VNC server sends specially crafted cursor shapes with large width or height values to a connecting VNC client.
*   **Impact**: Remote heap overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution.
*   **Affected Products**:
    *   SIMATIC ITC1500 V3: All versions < V3.2.1.0
    *   SIMATIC ITC1500 V3 PRO: All versions < V3.2.1.0
    *   SIMATIC ITC1900 V3: All versions < V3.2.1.0
    *   SIMATIC ITC1900 V3 PRO: All versions < V3.2.1.0
    *   SIMATIC ITC2200 V3: All versions < V3.2.1.0
    *   SIMATIC ITC2200 V3 PRO: All versions < V3.2.1.0
*   **Mitigation**: Update SIMATIC ITC products to V3.2.1.0 or later. Restrict access to port 5900/tcp to trusted IP addresses only.
*   **Fix**: The issue is resolved by limiting the width/height input values in `libvncclient/cursor.c`.
