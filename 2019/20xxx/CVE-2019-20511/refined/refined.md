The provided content describes a **Frame Injection vulnerability** in ERPNext version 11.1.47.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `blog_category` GET parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML, specifically an iframe element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input sanitization/validation: The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input before reflecting it in the web page. This lack of sanitization leads to the injection of malicious HTML code.
- Frame Injection: The vulnerability is specifically a frame injection, meaning an attacker injects an iframe.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows for the injection of malicious iframes within the context of the vulnerable web page. This can be used for phishing, redirection, or other malicious activities, although the impact is limited due to the medium severity rating and the CVSS score not indicating a direct impact on confidentiality or availability.
- While the impact is rated as low for confidentiality and none for integrity and availability, the UI:R (User Interaction Required) in the CVSS score indicates the user needs to take an action to be impacted by the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable URL.
- The attacker injects the malicious iframe code in the `blog_category` parameter of the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges and can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the web.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests to the target application with the specially crafted payload.
