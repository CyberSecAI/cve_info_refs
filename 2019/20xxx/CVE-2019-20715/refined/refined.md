This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router, gateway, and WiFi system models. However, the advisory does not list any associated CVE IDs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document identifies a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. The root cause is not described in detail.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected devices. When a user interacts with the affected device interface, the injected script can execute within the user's browser context. This can result in session hijacking, credential theft, or arbitrary actions on behalf of the user within the device interface.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web-based management interface of the affected devices. An attacker would need to inject malicious code into a field that gets stored and displayed later.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the ability to access and interact with the web-based configuration interface of the affected NETGEAR devices, possibly via an authenticated session with the device's administrative panel. This likely means having administrative credentials, or through a compromised user that has the ability to make configurations.
