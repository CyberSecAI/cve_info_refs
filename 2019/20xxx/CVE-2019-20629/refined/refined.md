Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function within the GPAC library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The primary impact is a crash of the application (MP4Box) due to the heap-buffer-overflow.
- Potential for further exploitation: While the provided information only details a crash, heap buffer overflows can sometimes be leveraged for more serious attacks, such as arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific circumstances and memory layout.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious input file: The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MPEG Transport Stream (M2TS) file that causes the `gf_m2ts_process_pmt` function to read beyond the buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious file to be processed by GPAC's MP4Box tool.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was found by a fuzzer, indicating the vulnerability was discovered using automated testing techniques.
- The specific location of the vulnerability in the code is `src/media_tools/mpegts.c:2372`
- The vulnerability was reported against commit `987169b` of the GPAC repository but was fixed in commit `2320eb7`.
- The provided PoC allows triggering of the vulnerability by using `MP4Box -info $PoC`.
