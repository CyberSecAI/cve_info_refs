# Securin Zero-Days

## CVE-2019-20435 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in WSO2 Product

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium.png)

Severity:Medium

#### Vendor

##### WSO2

#### Affected Product

##### WSO2 API Manager

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20435

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-11-1027

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### June 21, 2019

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered on WSO2 products inline API documentation editor page of the API Publisher.Â  A reflected cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to perform in the inline API documentation editor page of the API Publisher by sending an HTTP GET request with a harmful request parameter for ‘docName.’

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The POST request docName variable is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the URL, <https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/blocks/documentation/ajax/docs.jag>

***Figure 04:* *Crafted request with XSS payload, XSS<img src=x onerror=prompt(1)> gets reflected in the same browser as response.***

### Impact

By tricking a privileged user into clicking a created URL via email, IM, or a neutral web site, the attacker can make the browser get redirected to a malicious website, which makes changes in the UI of the web page and retrieve information from the browser or harm otherwise. But since all session-related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flat and protected, session hijacking or mounting a similar attack would not be possible.

### Remediations

Download the relevant patch based on the product version.

Severity: Low

Status: Fixed

Exploitation Requires Authentication?: **yes**

Vulnerable URL: <https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/blocks/documentation/ajax/docs.jag>

Vulnerable Variable: **docName**

# Description:

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WSO2 API Manager Product. By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies which means that the malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

POST request `docName` variable is vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting (XSS) in the URL, <https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/blocks/documentation/ajax/docs.jag>

**Reproducing Steps**

1. Login to the application **(admin/admin)** through the login [URL.](https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/pages/login.jag)
2. Go to API [‘Docs’](https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/info?name=test&version=2.0&provider=admin) section in the created API.
3. [‘Add New document’](https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/blocks/documentation/ajax/docs.jag) details and submit it.
4. Go to [‘Edit Content’](https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/pages/inline-editor.jag?docName=XSS&apiName=test&version=2.0&provider=admin&mode=edit&tenant=carbon.super) available to edit the document details.
5. Modify the [URL](https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/pages/inline-editor.jag?docName=XSS&apiName=test&version=2.0&provider=admin&mode=edit&tenant=carbon.super) variable, `docName` with a XSS payload, `XSS<img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>`
6. Now, click on the [crafted URL](https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/pages/inline-editor.jag?docName=XSS%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=prompt(1)%3E&apiName=test&version=2.0&provider=admin&mode=edit&tenant=carbon.super) to execute the injected XSS payload every time.
