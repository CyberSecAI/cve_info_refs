Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20435

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `docName` parameter of the WSO2 API Manager's inline API documentation editor. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or encode user-controlled input, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the `docName` parameter is echoed back in the application's response, allowing it to execute in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript, leading to various malicious actions within the user's browser.
*   **UI Manipulation:** The attacker can modify the appearance of the web page.
*   **Information Theft:** It is possible to steal information from the browser.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website.
*   **Potential Session Hijacking:** Although the session cookies are protected with `httpOnly` flags, the vulnerability does allow for UI changes and the potential to retrieve information from the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the `docName` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a privileged user into clicking the crafted URL. This can be done via email, IM, or a neutral website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to convince a privileged user to interact with the malicious link.
*   **No Direct System Access:** The attack does not require direct access to the WSO2 server. The attack is browser-based.
