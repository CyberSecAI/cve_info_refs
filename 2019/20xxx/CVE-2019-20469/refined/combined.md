Hi all,

A list of CVE’s in a bunch of IoT devices that never made it to the general public through other means, but have either
been fixed, or never will be fixed, since they are a couple of years old.

```
> ```
> [Suggested description]
> An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.
> By sending a specific request to the webserver, it is possible to
> enable the telnet interface on the device. The telnet interface can
> then be used to obtain access to the device with root privileges and a
> default password. This default telnet password is the same across all
> Siime Eye devices.
> In order for the attack to be exploited, an attacker must be physically
> close in order to connect to the device's Wi-Fi access point.

Use CVE-2020-11916.

```
> ```
> [Suggested description]
> An issue was discovered in Siime Eye 14.1.00000001.3.330.0.0.3.14.
> It uses a default SSID value, which makes it easier for remote attackers to

> privacy of users who do not wish to disclose their ownership of this type of device.
> (Various resources such as wigle.net can be use for mapping of SSIDs to physical locations.)

>
> [Additional Information]
> The access point is only detectable when the device is turned on. As the device is turned on for limited times less

>
> Wigle.net is a site which maps SSIDs to physical locations. Using this
> site, it is possible to filter on specific SSIDs. When a filter is
> applied to find the default SSID of the Siime Eye, it is possible to
> find several devices across the globe. The map shown on wigle shows an
> approximate physical location for the device and hence makes physical
> or physical proximity attacks more likely.

> userâ€™s knowledge or consent.
>
> In order to execute a CSRF attack, a user must be tricked into visiting
> an attacker controlled page, using the same browser that is

Use CVE-2020-11920.

```
> ```
> [Suggested description]
> An issue was discovered in Lush 2 through 2020-02-25.
> Due to the lack of Bluetooth traffic encryption, it is possible to
> hijack an ongoing Bluetooth connection between the Lush 2 and a mobile
> phone. This allows an attacker to gain full control over the device.
>
> ------------------------------------------
>
> [Additional Information]
> The victim will lose the legitimate connection and therefore will lose
> the ability to control the device. This attack hijacks the connection,
> even when someone else was actively using the device before. The
> original user loses control, and the attacker gains control of the
> device. Note that the user of the device remains capable of simply
> shutting it down. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker
> must be present in a certain radius in which the Bluetooth connection
> can be intercepted. This attack vector also requires specific hardware

### Wat kost het eigenlijk

Je hebt geen abonnement nodig! De GPS-horloges worden standaard geleverd met een Prepaid-plan. Je betaalt alleen voor wat je gebruikt, zonder starttarief en zonder extra kosten in heel Europa.

**Tarieven:**

* Bellen: €0,0036 per seconde in Nederland en Europa.
* Dataverbruik: €0,04 per MB.
* GPS positiedata: €0,01 per dag.

Het Prepaid-plan heeft een fee van €1,25 per 30 dagen voor het gebruik, ontwikkeling en onderhoud van de app en services. Dit wordt automatisch van je beltegoed ingehouden. Heb je geen saldo? Dan betaal je ook geen fee.
Meer informatie, kijk op onze beltegoed pagina!

## Unlimited of prepaid

### Vrije keuze! Kies zelf het plan dat bij je past

Het GPS-horloge werkt als een mobiele telefoon en maakt gebruik van een simkaart op ons eigen netwerk (powered by KPN). Standaard leveren wij de GPS-horloges op het 'prepaid' plan. Je betaalt dan alleen wat je verbruikt. Is je kind een fanatieke (video) beller? Dan kan het voordelig zijn om te switchen naar ons ‘Unlimited’ plan. Voor een vast bedrag per maand kan jouw kind onbeperkt bellen en data gebruiken! In onze app kun je op ieder moment switchen tussen ‘Prepaid’ of ‘Unlimited’. Meer weten? Check onze[beltegoed pagina](/beltegoed)!

### Voordelen Unlimited

Blijf altijd bereikbaar zonder opwaarderen. Met Unlimited maak je onbeperkt gebruik van functies zoals (video)bellen en dataverbruik bij GPS-locatie bepalen. Alles voor slechts €7,95 per maand, inclusief €1,25 gebruikersfee! Ervaar het gemak van Unlimited.
