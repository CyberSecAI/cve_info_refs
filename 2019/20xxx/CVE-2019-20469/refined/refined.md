Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2019-20469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The TK-Star Q90 Junior GPS smartwatch allows actions to be triggered via SMS commands using a default password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The smartwatch directly uses SMS commands to perform actions without proper authorization.
- **Default Password:** The device uses a default password for administrative purposes that is known to attackers.
- **SMS Command Injection:**  The device processes SMS commands, which can be used to trigger unintended actions like initiating a phone call.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Voice Communication:** An attacker can force the watch to make a call to a number of the attacker's choosing, enabling them to eavesdrop or potentially communicate through the device without the knowledge of the wearer.
- **Information Disclosure:** The ability to initiate calls exposes the device user to potential privacy violations.
- **Code Execution:** The SMS commands allow for execution of specific functions on the device, such as initiating calls.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SMS Messages:** The primary attack vector is sending specially crafted SMS messages to the smartwatch's phone number.
- **Remote:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, requiring only knowledge of the device's phone number.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Device's Phone Number:**  An attacker must know the phone number of the SIM card in the smartwatch to send malicious SMS commands.
- **SMS Sending Capability:** An attacker must be able to send SMS messages to the device's phone number.
- **Knowledge of Default Password:** The attacker would need to know the default password of the device, however, this can be obtained through other vulnerabilities.
