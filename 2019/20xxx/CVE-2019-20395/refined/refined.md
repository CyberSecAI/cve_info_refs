Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20395:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow when parsing YANG files.
- This occurs due to self-referential union types containing leafrefs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Applications that use libyang to process untrusted input YANG files may crash due to a stack overflow, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious YANG file with self-referential union types containing leafrefs.
- This crafted file is then processed by an application using the vulnerable libyang library, triggering the stack overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted YANG file to an application that uses the vulnerable version of libyang.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in libyang versions up to v1.0-r1.
- The upstream issue and fix are available on GitHub.
- The fix involves handling cyclic typedefs with unions, as indicated in the commit message.
- The specific files involved in the fix are `src/resolve.c`, where changes were made to `resolve_superior_type` to prevent infinite recursion.
- The issue was reported by Juraj Vijtiuk and addressed by Michal Vasko.
- A Debian LTS advisory (DLA-3572-1) has been issued for this vulnerability.
