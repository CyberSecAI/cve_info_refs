## Description

![@jvijtiuk](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30860583?v=4&size=48)[jvijtiuk](https://github.com/jvijtiuk)opened [on Mar 8, 2019](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/724#issue-418726165)

Hi,

the following yang file causes a segmentation fault in lys\_parse\_path, caused by a stack overflow due to too many function calls.

```
module mod1 {
    namespace "urn:all";
    prefix av;
    yang-version 1.1;

    leaf l1 {
        type union-type;
    }

    leaf-list list5 {
        type string;
    }

    typedef union-type {
        type union {
            type leafref {
                path /list5;
            }
            type union-type;
        }
    }
}

```

The issue seems to be caused due to the self-referential union-type type containing a leaf-ref.

If the list5 leaf-list is removed, the issue persists, but the stack overflow takes longer to appear.

A gdb backtrace shows that the call stack is full of lys\_copy\_union\_leafrefs calls, called in src/tree\_schema.c:1903 and src/tree\_schema.c:1887.

Regards,

Juraj

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v0.16-r3...v1.0-r1`

Package        : libyang
Version        : 0.16.105+really1.0-0+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-20391 CVE-2019-20392 CVE-2019-20393 CVE-2019-20394
                 CVE-2019-20395 CVE-2019-20396 CVE-2019-20397 CVE-2019-20398

Multiple flaws were found in libyang, a parser toolkit for IETF YANG data
modeling. Double frees, invalid memory access and Null pointer dereferences
may cause a denial of service or potentially code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.16.105+really1.0-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libyang packages.

For the detailed security status of libyang please refer to
its security tracker page at:
