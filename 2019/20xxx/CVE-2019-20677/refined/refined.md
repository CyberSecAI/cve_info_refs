This document describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting NETGEAR Orbi WiFi Systems.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected device. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed in the provided text, however, stored XSS vulnerabilities typically involve injecting malicious scripts via user input fields or settings that are then stored on the server and executed when other users view the affected data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The document indicates that this is a stored XSS vulnerability, so the attacker would need the ability to inject the malicious script. The exact requirements are not detailed.
- The CVSS vector indicates that the attacker would need to have high privileges (PR:H) on the affected device.

**Affected product models:**
- RBR50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
- RBS50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
- RBK50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
