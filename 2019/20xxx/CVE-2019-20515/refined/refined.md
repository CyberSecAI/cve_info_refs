The provided content is related to CVE-2019-20515.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the URL, which leads to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application does not properly encode or filter user-provided data within the URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Potentially steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information.
- Redirect the user to malicious websites.
- Perform actions on behalf of the user.
- Deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are through crafted URLs. The identified vulnerable URLs and their respective injected payloads include:

*   `http://{DOMAIN}/address/'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(‘test’)</scRipt>`
*   `http://{DOMAIN}/addresses/'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(‘test’)</scRipt>`
*   `http://{DOMAIN}/blog/"onload="alert(‘test’)" x`
*   `http://{DOMAIN}/contact/'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(‘test’)</scRipt>`
*    `http://{DOMAIN}/project/'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(‘test’)</scRipt>`
*   `http://{DOMAIN}/user/admin@example.comx"%20onmouseover=alert(‘test’)%20x="`
*   `http://{DOMAIN}/api/method/x"%20onmouseover=alert(‘test’)%20x="`
*   `http://{DOMAIN}/api/x"%20onmouseover=alert(‘test’)%20x="`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and induce a victim to click on it. This can be done by:
- Sending the crafted link to a user via email or other communication channels.
- Embedding the link on a website the user visits.
- Any other method of getting a victim to access the crafted URL.
