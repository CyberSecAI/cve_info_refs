Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles the termination of userspace components associated with FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) filesystems, specifically when a process with a PID namespace mounts a FUSE filesystem. If the userspace component (typically the FUSE daemon) terminates unexpectedly (specifically PID 1 termination in the provided exploit example), the kernel fails to properly clean up in-flight operations. This leaves FUSE requests in an uninterruptible sleep state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninterruptible Sleep:** FUSE requests get stuck in an uninterruptible sleep (`request_wait_answer`) when the userspace daemon terminates without responding to the in-flight operations. This state is problematic because it cannot be interrupted or terminated through normal process management mechanisms.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The uninterruptible sleep state results in a resource leak. The /dev/fuse file descriptor remains open, preventing the mount namespace, and consequently the pid namespace, from being torn down. This ultimately prevents the FUSE connection from being aborted, leading to a resource exhaustion issue.
- **Lack of Proper Cleanup:** The kernel does not handle the scenario where the FUSE daemon terminates unexpectedly, resulting in a failure to properly clean up pending FUSE operations, resulting in the aforementioned resource leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The inability to terminate the uninterruptible sleeping FUSE requests or tear down namespaces will lead to system instability and a lack of resources. A reboot is required to recover from this state.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by local users who have the capability to mount FUSE filesystems, and the exploit does not require root. In cases where user namespaces are not available, root privileges are required.
- **Exploitation through FUSE:**  Exploitation relies on mounting a FUSE filesystem and then forcibly terminating the FUSE daemon process (PID 1 in the provided github exploit example). This can be achieved by sending a signal or intentionally crashing it, but in general the PID 1 termination is an indirect result of the reboot called by the fuse process in this example.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a local user capable of mounting a FUSE filesystem and have access to the command line of the target system.
- **PID Namespace:** The attacker must be able to create a PID namespace.  User namespaces allow this without root privileges. If user namespaces are unavailable then root access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

- The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products that incorporate Linux kernels prior to version 5.7 are vulnerable.
- The provided GitHub link shows example exploit code using a simple FUSE filesystem, and shows how to achieve the vulnerable state and crash the kernel by using `cat /tmp/example/fire`, which triggers the logic causing the crash.
- The vulnerability is triggered by an unexpected termination of the FUSE daemon.
- The fix will involve better handling of the case where the FUSE daemon terminates unexpectedly and releasing all resources.
