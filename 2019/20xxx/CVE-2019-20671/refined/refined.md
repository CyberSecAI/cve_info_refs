The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Although it doesn't directly mention CVE-2019-20671, it addresses a similar issue, so it is potentially relevant.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, leading to stored cross-site scripting. This means a malicious script can be stored and executed in a user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser. This can result in:
  - Session hijacking
  - Information theft
  - Phishing attacks
  - Defacement of the website
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would inject malicious JavaScript code into a vulnerable input field. When a user accesses the page displaying the unsanitized data, the script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject data into the system. This is typically achieved by having an account on the affected system or by finding an unauthenticated entry point.
- The attacker also needs to be able to store the malicious script.

**Affected Products:**
- RBR20, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
- RBS20, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
- RBK20, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.26
- RBR40, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
- RBS40, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
- RBK40, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
- RBR50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
- RBS50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
- RBK50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory recommends updating to the latest firmware to remediate this vulnerability.
- The advisory has a CVSS v3 rating of Medium with a score of 6.
