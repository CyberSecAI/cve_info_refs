{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `osd_bufs_get` function in the `osd_ldiskfs` module of the Lustre file system lacks validation for the `len` field, which is derived from the Nio buffer section of packets sent by the client. This lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds access in the `osd_map_remote_to_local` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "impact": "A kernel panic due to an attempt to access memory outside the allocated bounds. This can lead to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious client can send a crafted packet with a large `len` field to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious actor needs to be able to communicate with the Lustre server as a client.",
    "additional_details": "The provided crash log shows a kernel panic occurring in `lu_context_key_get`, which is called by `osd_map_remote_to_local` through the `osd_bufs_get` function when processing client requests. The `osd_bufs_get` function retrieves the buffer length `len` from the client's request without proper validation. This leads to an out-of-bounds read in the `osd_map_remote_to_local` function. The affected code is in the `osd_ldiskfs` module, specifically `osd_bufs_get` and `osd_map_remote_to_local` functions."
