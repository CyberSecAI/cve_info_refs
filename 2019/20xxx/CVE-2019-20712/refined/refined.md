- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Post-authentication buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists that can be exploited after successful authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of the device, potentially resulting in unauthorized access or control. The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker on the adjacent network after successful authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated on the device to exploit the vulnerability. This implies that the attacker has obtained valid credentials to login to the device.
