The provided content relates to CVE-2019-20173.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress Plugin for Auth0 versions 3.11.0, 3.11.1, and 3.11.2 do not properly sanitize the `wle` query parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of the `wle` query parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser on the login page.

**Attack vectors:**
By crafting a malicious URL with a specific `wle` query parameter, an attacker could inject malicious scripts on the wp-login.php page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and get a user to visit it. They would need to know the vulnerable plugin is in use, and the settings of the login form override.
