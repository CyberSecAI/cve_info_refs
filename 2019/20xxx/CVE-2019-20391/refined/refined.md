Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `resolve_feature_value()` function within the `libyang` library. Specifically, it is triggered when an `if-feature` statement is used inside a `bit` definition within a YANG module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Invalid memory access:** The core issue is an invalid memory access. The function attempts to access memory incorrectly when handling conditional features defined within bit types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash due to the invalid memory access, leading to a denial of service. Applications using `libyang` to parse untrusted YANG files are vulnerable to crashing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is by providing a maliciously crafted YANG file to an application using the `libyang` library. This file contains an `if-feature` statement within a `bit` type definition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply or influence the YANG files that the vulnerable application parses. This can be achieved through various means including:
   -  Directly supplying the malformed file to the application.
   -  Manipulating the source of YANG files used by the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified via a crash report in the `yangfuzz` and `yanglint` tools, both of which use the libyang library.
- The fix for this vulnerability is found in the commit [bdb596ddc07596fa212f231135b87d0b9178f6f8](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/commit/bdb596ddc07596fa212f231135b87d0b9178f6f8) on the libyang github repository.
- The fix involves a modification in `src/resolve.c` which involves a change in the `resolve_iffeature` function.
- The vulnerability is present in `libyang` versions up to `v1.0-r3`
- This CVE has been assigned to the issue reported by jvijtiuk and tracked as issue #772 [https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/772](https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/issues/772)

The vulnerability is triggered due to the handling of `if-feature` statements within the context of a `bit` type definition in YANG files. A malformed YANG file, when processed by `libyang`, can lead to memory access issues and subsequent crashes, causing a denial of service.
