The provided content relates to CVE-2019-20094.

**Root Cause:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs in the `gif_init_frame` function within `fromgif.c`.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact:**
*   The vulnerability leads to a crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow, as reported by AddressSanitizer (ASan).
*   The overflow could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution in more sophisticated scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted GIF file with `img2sixel`.
*   Specifically, the issue occurs during frame initialization (`gif_init_frame`) while handling GIF image data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to provide a malicious GIF file to the `img2sixel` tool.
*   The attacker needs no prior authentication or elevated permissions.
