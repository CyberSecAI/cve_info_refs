Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CVE-2019-20058 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The web application doesn't properly validate or encode user input when generating output in the admin panel logs. Specifically, when a user performs a search using a malicious payload, this payload is stored and then executed in the admin panel's database page.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject a malicious JavaScript payload via the search functionality of the application.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious payloads that are executed when an admin views the logs in the admin panel. This can lead to:

    *   Account takeover
    *   Phishing
    *   Keylogging
    *   CSRF token theft
    *   Session hijacking
*   **Affected component:** The admin panel's database log page (`http://hostname/_profiler/token?panel=db`)
*   **Attacker skill/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They only need to be able to access the search functionality of the website.
*   **Payload Example:** `<img src=x onerror=javascript:confirm(113)>` (URL-encoded: `%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Djavascript%3Aconfirm%28113%29%3E`)

The content provides detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability and recommendations for mitigation, including:

*   Encoding data on output.
*   Filtering input on arrival.
*   Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP).
