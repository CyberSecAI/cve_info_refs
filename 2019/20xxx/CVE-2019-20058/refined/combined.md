## Description

![@007-prankster](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16994452?v=4&size=48)[007-prankster](https://github.com/007-prankster)opened [on Dec 17, 2019](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/issues/7830#issue-539057977)

**1. Bug Summary:**

**Stored Cross-Site Scripting:**

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

**Scenario:**

When an end user is searching (<http://hostname/search?search=term>) for any results logs are being generated in admin panel ([http://hostname/\_profiler/).When](http://hostname/_profiler/%29.When) an end-user inputs malicious payload such as

URL-Encoded: **%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Djavascript%3Aconfirm%28113%29%3E**

Decoded: **<img src=x onerror=javascript:confirm(113)>**

Javascript is being executed on Database page of the admin panel (<http://hostname/_profiler/token?panel=db>) and unauthenticated attacker can use such malicious payloads to perform various exploits and phishing,Implement keylogger, CSRF Token Stealth,Session Aware Keylogger,etc.

**2. Steps to Reproduce:**

Navigate to <http://host/>

Click on Search

Input payload from above

[![end-user-payload](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16994452/70997637-8c3e6180-20fb-11ea-93ed-ff4b7ab4c609.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16994452/70997637-8c3e6180-20fb-11ea-93ed-ff4b7ab4c609.png)

To validate the finding login to admin console and navigate to <http://hostname/_profiler> and select the log with payload navigate to database (<http://hostname/_profiler/token?panel=db>)

Selecting Logs:

Navigating to Database:

Payload Executed:

**3. Mitigation:**

* Encode data on output. At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, encode the output to prevent it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding.
* Filter input on arrival. At the point where user input is received, filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input.
* Content Security Policy. As a last line of defense, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
