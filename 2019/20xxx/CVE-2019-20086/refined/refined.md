*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow caused by reading beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted MP4 file (`poc0.zip`) to the `gpmf-parse` utility.
*   **Impact:** Crash of the `gpmf-parse` application.
*   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious file.
*   **Details:** The provided AddressSanitizer output shows a READ of size 4 at address `0x61f000000c6c`, which is located 0 bytes to the right of a 3053-byte region. The allocation was done by `realloc` in `GetPayload` called from `main`.
