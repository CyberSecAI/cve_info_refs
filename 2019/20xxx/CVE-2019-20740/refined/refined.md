The provided document describes a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router and gateway models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the firmware of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow. This is a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing attackers to take full control of the affected device.  This could further lead to data exfiltration, denial of service, or other malicious activities. The CVSS v3 score of 6.3 indicates a medium severity, with High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment or have access to the local network to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to authenticate to the device's web interface (PR:H). This vulnerability is exploitable after successful authentication and requires user interaction (UI:R).

**Affected products and versions:**
   - DGN2200v4, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.110
   - DGND2200Bv4, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.109
   - R7300, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.70
   - R8300, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.130
   - R8500, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.130

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document mentions that this is a post-authentication vulnerability, meaning an attacker would need to have valid login credentials before being able to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Netgear provides instructions on how to update the firmware to patch this vulnerability.
*   The advisory is identified as PSV-2018-0258.
*   The vulnerability is not associated with a specific CVE ID in this advisory, although it is likely assigned one later.
