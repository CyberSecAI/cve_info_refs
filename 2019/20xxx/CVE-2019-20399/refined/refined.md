{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The original implementation of `check_overflow` in `src/scalar.rs` used boolean logic which could be vulnerable to timing side-channel attacks due to conditional branching based on the values of `self.0` array which contains scalar data. This could potentially leak information about the scalar values to an attacker.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Timing side-channel vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially recover secret scalar values by observing the execution time of the `check_overflow` function.",
  "Attack vectors": "Timing analysis of the `check_overflow` function.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to measure the execution time of the `check_overflow` function with sufficient accuracy. The attacker needs to have access to the system running the vulnerable code."
