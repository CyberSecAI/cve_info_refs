{
  "CVE-2019-20446": {
    "root_cause": "A crafted SVG file with nested patterns can cause denial of service due to exponential growth of rendered objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion",
       "Denial of service due to exponential element processing"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS), application crash, stack exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing of a specially crafted SVG file with nested patterns",
      "Nested use of SVG 'use' elements"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to craft or provide a malicious SVG file"
    ],
    "additional_details": "Librsvg now has limits on the number of loaded XML elements, and the number of referenced elements within an SVG document. Fixed a stack exhaustion with circular references in <use> elements. This vulnerability is similar to billion laughs vulnerability where an attacker crafts an XML file to cause the program to consume excessive memory resulting in a DoS."
