# Security Advisory GOVSA.2022.0506.1 - Temporary disabling and enabling of the Windows Firewall during a remote EV Reach Agent update

Click to see the notice

| **Advisory ID** | GOVSA.2022.0506.1 |
| --- | --- |
| **Vulnerability Type** | CWE-1038 Insecure Automated Optimizations |
| **Issue Date** | 2022-05-16 |
| **Updated On** | 2022-05-06 (Initial Advisory) |
| **Application** | EV Reach (Agent) |
| **Affected Versions** | EV Reach Console v10.5.0 and earlier EV Reach Client Agent v10.1.10 and earlier |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Vulnerability Status** | Update Released |
| **CVE Status** | Submitted - [CVE Record | CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31215) |

## Summary

| CVE.png | The Windows Firewall is temporarily turned off upon a EV Reach agent update operation in EV Reach Management Console v10.5.0, EV Reach Server v3.70.0 and earlier versions, which allows remote attackers to bypass firewall blocking rules for a time period up to 30 seconds. |
| --- | --- |

| **Vulnerability Type** | **Remotely exploitable** | **Impact** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Insecure Automated Optimizations | No | A remote system loses Windows Firewall protection for up to 30 seconds. |

## Detection

This behavior can be detected by the presence of one Windows Event that is not accompanied by a EV Reach Audit Event. If both events are present, the action was performed using the EV Reach consoles feature. If the Firewall Event ID 2003 is the only event present and the Modifying Application is GovAgent64.exe then this vulnerability is present.The Windows Event viewer records **Event ID 2003** when the Windows Firewall has been enabled or disabled.![06052022_1 FirewallDisable.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/EV-Reach/EV-Reach-Security-Notices-Advisories/WebHome/06052022_1%20FirewallDisable.png?rev=1.1)The EV Reach Console allows an operator to disable the Windows Firewall if the operator has the appropriate Windows permissions to do so. When the Firewall is disabled via an administrative action, the endpoint event viewer will log **Event ID 6549** with the details of the action listed in the Event.![06052022_1 FirewallAudit.png](/xwiki/bin/download/Documentation/EV-Reach/EV-Reach-Security-Notices-Advisories/WebHome/06052022_1%20FirewallAudit.png?rev=1.1)
## EV Reach Auditing

The EV Reach Agents are designed to monitor all configuration changes that are performed on a system by EV Reach Operators. All audits are contained in the Windows Event Viewer of the endpoint system. We recommended using a SEIM product at the endpoint to detect EV Reach related events. See [EV Reach Auditing](/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/EV-Reach/EV-Reach-Console/EV-Reach-Console-Configuration-Getting-Started/EV-Reach-Console-Configuration-Auditing-Operator-Actions/) for more information.
## Relevant Products

This vulnerability is exposed by the EV Reach Agent process: GovAgentx64.exe and GovAgent.exe versions **10.1.10** and earlier.These EV Reach Client Agent are distributed on remote machine via the EV Reach Console and EV Reach Server versions **10.5.0** and **3.70.0** and earlier respectively.
## Remediation

| Product | Action |
| --- | --- |
| EV Reach Console v10.5.0 and earlier | Update to v10.5.1 or later |
| EV Reach Server v3.70.0 and earlier | Update to v3.70.1 or later |
| EV Reach Client Agent v10.1.10 and earlier | Update to v10.1.11 or later |
