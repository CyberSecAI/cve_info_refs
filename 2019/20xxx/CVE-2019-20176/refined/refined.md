Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack exhaustion issue in the `listdir` function of `ls.c` in pure-ftpd.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `listdir` function was allocating a new buffer on the stack for each file/directory entry when listing directory contents.
- On systems with small stack sizes and directories containing many entries, this could lead to stack exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack exhaustion would cause the user session to abort, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could trigger the vulnerability by requesting a directory listing of a directory containing a large number of files/subdirectories.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated FTP user with the ability to list directory content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the FTP server and be able to log in
- The attacker must be able to issue the LIST command on a directory with enough files to cause a stack overflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Antonio Morales from the GitHub Security Lab team.
- The fix involves reusing a single buffer to store the file names instead of allocating a new one for each entry, which prevents excessive stack memory usage.
- The issue is present in pure-ftpd version 1.0.49
