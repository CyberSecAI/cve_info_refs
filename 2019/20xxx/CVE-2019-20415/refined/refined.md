Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20415:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the logging and profiling settings functionality within Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:** The application does not properly validate that requests to modify logging and profiling settings originate from a legitimate user's session, thus being vulnerable to CSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can modify logging and profiling settings without the user's knowledge or consent.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, such as enabling debug logging that could expose sensitive information, or altering log settings to hide the attacker's activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could craft a malicious web page or link that, when visited by an authenticated Jira user, would trigger a request to modify logging and profiling settings within their Jira instance. This request would be performed in the background without the user's explicit awareness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in Jira user into visiting a malicious webpage or link.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the Jira instance; they can exploit the vulnerability remotely via the user's browser.

**Additional Notes**
* The issue is categorized as a "Low" priority bug, and has a CVSS "Medium" score.
* The vulnerability affects versions of Jira Server and Data Center prior to 7.13.3 and between 8.0.0 and 8.1.0.
* The bug was introduced in version 7.13.
* The vulnerability was fixed in versions 7.13.3 and 8.1.0.
