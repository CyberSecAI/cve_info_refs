Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `docName`, `version`, and `apiName` parameters when updating API documentation within the WSO2 API Manager. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-supplied data in the HTTP response without proper sanitization, allowing execution of injected JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to various actions such as:
    *   Redirecting the victim to malicious websites.
    *   Changing the UI of the web page.
    *   Potentially retrieving sensitive information from the browser.

*   **Session Hijacking (Mitigated):** While the potential for session hijacking is mentioned, the documentation also states that session-related sensitive cookies are protected with the `httpOnly` flag which mitigates the risk of cookie theft through XSS and subsequent session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulated HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the application, injecting XSS payloads into the vulnerable parameters (`docName`, `version`, `apiName`) when updating the document information of an existing API documentation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to the WSO2 API Manager application as they need to be able to access the API documentation update functionality.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (`docName`, `version`, `apiName`) within the API documentation update functionality to inject the payload.
*   **Ability to Intercept/Modify HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP request. This can be achieved using a web proxy or by crafting the request manually.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0.
*   The provided proof of concept clearly illustrates how the XSS payload is injected and reflected in the browser.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed by WSO2, with patches available for download.

**Timeline:** The timeline shows that the vulnerability was discovered in July 2019 and fixed by WSO2 by October 2019 with public disclosure in November 2019
