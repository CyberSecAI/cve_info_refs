WSO2 Product Bug Report

Bug Name: Multiple reflected [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_site_scripting_%28OTG-INPVAL-001%29)

Product Name: [WSO2](https://wso2.com/)

Server: [WSO2 API Manager](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/WSO2%2BAPI%2BManager%2BDocumentation)

Version: [2.6.0](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/About%2Bthis%2BRelease)

Homepage: <https://wso2.com/>

Severity: Low

Status: Fixed

Exploitation Requires Authentication?: **yes**

# AFFECTED PRODUCTS:

[1] WSO2 API Manager

# Description:

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WSO2 API Manager Product. By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack a logged in user’s session by stealing cookies which means that the malicious hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim while the hacker maintains access.

# Proof of concept: (POC)

The following Vulnerability is tested on WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0 Product.

**Issue 01: Multiple reflected cross site scripting:**

[![Picture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716101-aacec700-3b97-11ea-999c-171020e8fd15.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716101-aacec700-3b97-11ea-999c-171020e8fd15.png)

Figure 01: Update the existing document information created. (here API Name is ‘reflected XSS’)

[![Picture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716103-ab675d80-3b97-11ea-859a-8e349cb807fa.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716103-ab675d80-3b97-11ea-859a-8e349cb807fa.png)

Figure 02: Add XSS payload to the variable “docName”

[![Picture3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716105-ab675d80-3b97-11ea-8076-380116f4cc0c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716105-ab675d80-3b97-11ea-8076-380116f4cc0c.png)

Figure 03: HTTP Response for the modified “docName” variable with XSS payload.

[![Picture4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716107-abfff400-3b97-11ea-9cf1-3d7920462298.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716107-abfff400-3b97-11ea-9cf1-3d7920462298.png)

Figure 04: Injected XSS payload, “><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> gets reflected in the browser response.

**Issue 02 & 03:**

[![Picture5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716108-abfff400-3b97-11ea-8665-2bb6e5d4256d.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716108-abfff400-3b97-11ea-8665-2bb6e5d4256d.png)

Figure 05: Injected XSS payload in variable docName, version and apiName gets reflected in the Response

[![Picture6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716111-adc9b780-3b97-11ea-850a-16b7d2c71f8e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716111-adc9b780-3b97-11ea-850a-16b7d2c71f8e.png)

Figure 06: Injected payload gets reflected in the browser THREE times (THREE places)

[![Picture7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716112-ae624e00-3b97-11ea-93a8-fd94ce4f3671.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/72716112-ae624e00-3b97-11ea-93a8-fd94ce4f3671.png)

Figure 07: Page Looks after executing the injected XSS payload

---

**Reproducing Steps**

1. Login to the application `(admin/admin)` through the login [URL.](https://192.168.107.2:9443/publisher/site/pages/login.jag)
2. Go to the [page](https://192.168.0.138:9443/publisher/info?name=test&version=test&provider=admin) where an API is already created
3. Create a document for the created API by clicking on `“Add New Document”` button.
4. Created documents are listed as shown in figure 01
5. Click on `“Update”` button to update document information.
6. Add relevant information and capture the request in proxy to add XSS payload `“><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>”` in `“docName”` variable.
7. Now, Injected XSS payload gets executed in the browser.

Note: Similarly, add XSS payload to the other vulnerable variables `“version”` and `“apiName”` which reflects in the browser.

## CVE-2019-20440 – Multiple Reflected Cross-site Scripting in WSO2

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/low.png)

Severity:Low

#### Vendor

##### WSO2

#### Affected Product

##### WSO2 API Manager

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-20440

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-01-1021

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### July 6, 2019

### Description

Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in WSO2 API Manager Product 2.6.0 in the update API documentation feature of the API Publisher. A reflected cross-site script (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the application. An input variable vulnerable to reflected XSS is ‘docName,’ ‘version’ and ‘apiName’ in the APIs page.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

The following vulnerability was tested on the WSO2 API Manager version 2.6.0 Product.

Issue 01: Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-1(14).png)***

***Figure 01:* *Update the existing document information created. (here API Name is âreflected XSSâ).***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-2(13).png)

***Figure 02:* *Add XSS payload to the variable âdocName.â***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-3(11).png)

***Â Figure 03: â**HTTP Response for the modified âdocNameâ variable with XSS payload.â***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-4(10).png)

***Figure 04:* *Injected XSS payload, â><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> gets reflected in the browser response.***

Issue 02 & 03:

***Figure 05:* *Injected XSS payload in variable docName, version, and apiName gets reflected in the response.***

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-6(4).png)***

***Figure 06:* *Injected payload gets reflected in the browser THREE times (THREE places).***

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-7(2).png)

***Figure 07:* *Page Looks after executing the injected XSS payload.***

### Impact

Through an XSS attack, the attacker can make the browser redirect to a malicious website. Unauthorized actions such as changing the UI of the web page, retrieving information from the browser are possible. But since all session-related sensitive cookies are set with httpOnly flat and protected, session hijacking or mounting a similar attack would not be possible.

### Remediations
