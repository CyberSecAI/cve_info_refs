Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20170:

**CVE Description:**

The Debian security advisory describes CVE-2019-20170 as an "invalid pointer dereference in the function `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete()` in `odf/ipmpx_code.c`."

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an invalid pointer dereference within the `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete` function, located in the `odf/ipmpx_code.c` file. This suggests that the code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is either null or points to deallocated/invalid memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is an attempt to dereference an invalid pointer within the `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The provided crash reports from GitHub and the Debian advisory indicate that this vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), causing the application to crash. This results in a denial of service, as the program terminates unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Media File:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted media file. The GitHub issue explicitly mentions a Proof of Concept (POC) file that triggers the vulnerability, `POC-new-GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete`. The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted file is parsed by the MP4Box tool.
*   **Parsing of IPMPX Data:** The vulnerability specifically occurs during the processing of IPMPX data within the media file, specifically during the call to `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted media file to the vulnerable application (GPAC/MP4Box). This might involve tricking a user into opening the file or serving it through a media server.
*   **Understanding of File Format:** A deep understanding of the MP4 file format, particularly the structure of IPMPX data, is likely needed to craft a malicious file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the provided Content:**

*   **Specific Function and File:** The vulnerability is located in `odf/ipmpx_code.c` at line 115 in function `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete`.
*   **Call Stack:** The GitHub issue provides the full call stack, highlighting the chain of function calls leading to the crash, starting from `gf_isom_open_file` to `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete`.
*   **AddressSanitizer:** The AddressSanitizer output from the github issue confirms the heap-use-after-free in  `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete` at line 115.
*   **Versions Affected:** The GitHub issue confirms the vulnerability exists in GPAC versions up to 0.9.0 and the Debian security advisory mentions that the fix was applied to version `0.5.0+svn5324~dfsg1-1+deb8u5`.
*   **Fuzzing:** The vulnerability was found using a fuzzer, indicating it might be exploitable with crafted inputs in an automated fashion.

In summary, CVE-2019-20170 is a vulnerability where an invalid pointer dereference in `GF_IPMPX_AUTH_Delete` causes a denial of service. The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted media file is processed by GPAC, specifically during the parsing of IPMPX data.
