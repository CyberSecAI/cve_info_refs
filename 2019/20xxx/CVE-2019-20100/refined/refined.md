Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20100

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the Atlassian Application Links plugin. Specifically, the `/rest/applinks/3.0/applicationlinkForm/manifest.json` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper CSRF protection mechanisms. This allows an attacker to craft malicious HTTP requests that are executed within the context of an authenticated user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Network Enumeration:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to enumerate hosts and open ports on the internal network where the Jira server is located. This can reveal valuable information about the network infrastructure to the attacker.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The information gathered during network enumeration can be used to perform further attacks against the internal network and potentially other systems that are reachable from Jira's network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Links:** The attack vector involves tricking an authenticated administrator user into clicking a malicious link that initiates a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on social engineering techniques to convince the victim to interact with the malicious link.
*   **WebSudo Session Requirement:** The victim needs to have an active WebSudo session (administrative user access) for the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **External Access:** The attacker does not need any specific access or privileges to the Jira server, they only need to be able to reach a user with administrative privileges via a social engineering attack.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know or discover the vulnerable endpoint (`/rest/applinks/3.0/applicationlinkForm/manifest.json`).
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to craft a malicious HTTP request targeting the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects various versions of the Atlassian Application Links plugin and Jira Server and Data Center before version 8.7.0.
*   The provided proof-of-concept code shows how an attacker can scan a range of IP addresses by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request to `/rest/applinks/3.0/applicationlinkForm/manifest.json` along with a targeted URL.
*   The issue was reported to Atlassian by Tenable, which also provides a detailed timeline of the disclosure process.
*   The issue is fixed in Jira Server and Data Center version 8.7.0 and above as well as several patch versions on older branches.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a medium severity.
