{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the URL, leading to the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the web page, or redirection to malicious sites. Depending on the user's permissions, an attacker might be able to perform actions on their behalf.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted URLs with injected malicious JavaScript code as part of URI parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft specific URLs and trick a user into clicking them. The attacker does not need prior authentication to perform the attack."
