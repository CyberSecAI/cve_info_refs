Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20800:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the CGI handler of the Cherokee webserver.
- The `cherokee_handler_cgi_t` structure uses a fixed-size array `envp` to store environment variables, including request headers.
- The code adds headers to this array without checking if the boundary is reached, which can lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow/Out-of-bounds Write:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to the lack of boundary checks when adding headers to the `envp` array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write causes a segmentation fault (SEGV) and crashes the server, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided information focuses on a crash, a more sophisticated attacker might be able to leverage the memory corruption for more serious consequences, such as arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server.
- **HTTP Headers:** The attack vector involves sending a request with a large number of headers to overflow the `envp` array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server to send HTTP requests.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability is triggered within the request processing and does not require any authentication or privilege level.

**Technical Details:**
- The `cherokee_handler_cgi_add_env_pair` function in `handler_cgi.c` is responsible for adding environment variables. It does not check if the index `cgi->envp_last` exceeds the bounds of `cgi->envp`.
- The issue is triggered in the `foreach_header_add_unknown_variable` function in `handler_cgi_base.c`.
- The `cherokee_handler_cgi_t` structure is defined in `handler_cgi.h`.
- The `ENV_VAR_NUM` constant determines the size of the `envp` array.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending multiple `Host` headers.
- The ASAN output confirms the out-of-bounds write in `cherokee_handler_cgi_add_env_pair` function, leading to a crash.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description and includes a PoC and debugging information.
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing and manual analysis.
- The issue has been reported on the Cherokee's GitHub page and has been fixed.

The information provided is specific to the out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the CGI handler, which matches the description of CVE-2019-20800.
