The provided content relates to commit `c246f6f69a749d4f68626b40795a4f69168008f4` in the OpenSC/OpenSC repository. This commit addresses a vulnerability in the `card-coolkey.c` file.

Root cause: The code was not ensuring that object IDs were unique when filling the object list.
Vulnerability: Non-unique object IDs.
Impact: The impact is not explicitly stated, but the commit message and code suggest it could lead to internal errors.
Attack vector: Fuzzing revealed the issue, suggesting an attacker could potentially manipulate object creation to trigger the vulnerability.
Required capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to influence the creation of objects within the Coolkey card functionality.

The fix adds a check to ensure the object ID is unique before adding a new object to the list:

```c
if (coolkey_find_object_by_id(&priv->objects_list, object_id) != NULL) {
    return SC_ERROR_INTERNAL;
}
```
