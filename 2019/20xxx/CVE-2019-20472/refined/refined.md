Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20472:

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-20472 describes a vulnerability in the TK-Star Q90 Junior GPS horloge, specifically related to the lack of PIN protection for the SIM card used in the device.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The device does not support or enforce the use of a PIN for the SIM card. If a SIM card with a PIN is inserted, the device displays an error message and becomes unusable until the PIN is removed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Lack of PIN Protection:** The device forces users to disable SIM card PIN protection, which is a standard security measure to prevent unauthorized use of the SIM card if the device is lost or stolen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Ease of SIM Card Use:** If the device is stolen, an attacker can easily remove the SIM card and use it without needing to bypass any PIN protection.
-   **Financial Impact:** Depending on the services associated with the SIM, the attacker could potentially make calls, use data, or send SMS at the expense of the victim.
-   **Privacy Concerns:** If the device was used for calls, messages, or had associated accounts tied to the phone number the attacker may have access to those as well

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Physical Theft:** The primary attack vector is physical theft of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical possession of the TK-Star Q90 Junior GPS horloge.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "recommendation to disable common security measures" rather than a traditional exploit.
*   The provided content comes from a security list archive and a vendor website, offering both technical details and product context.
*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of IoT vulnerabilities found by Qbit.
*  The One2track website shows some of the devices, however, there is no mention of TK-Star on the website

**In summary, CVE-2019-20472 highlights a critical security flaw that forces users to disable a fundamental security measure, creating an opportunity for attackers to misuse the device's SIM card if the device is physically stolen.**
