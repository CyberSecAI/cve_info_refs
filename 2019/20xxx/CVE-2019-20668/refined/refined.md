This document describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR Orbi WiFi systems. While the document does not mention CVE-2019-20668, it does detail a vulnerability and associated fix, so it is relevant.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The specific location or method of injection is not detailed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS. This implies that malicious scripts can be stored within the application (likely in a configuration setting or similar), and executed when other users access that page/setting/etc.

**Impact of exploitation:**  The document does not fully detail impact, but states that it is a high impact to confidentiality and integrity with no impact to availability. A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of another user's browser when that user interacts with the vulnerable part of the application. This could include actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies and session information, potentially leading to account takeover
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim
    - Defacing the web page
    - Phishing for credentials

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is local, requiring an attacker to be authenticated to the device. The specific entrypoint is not disclosed. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated user, with high privileges is required to inject the malicious script.

**Affected Products:**
*   RBR20 (firmware before 2.3.5.26)
*   RBS20 (firmware before 2.3.5.26)
*   RBK20 (firmware before 2.3.5.26)
*   RBR40 (firmware before 2.3.5.30)
*   RBS40 (firmware before 2.3.5.30)
*   RBK40 (firmware before 2.3.5.30)
