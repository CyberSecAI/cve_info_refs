RELATES TO CVE: CVE-2019-20483
```

The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities in Vera version 4.9.1.26180: a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2019-20483) and an Improper Access Control vulnerability (CVE-2019-20484).

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the "last name" field of the User module.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and output encoding.
*   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated user with access to the User Management module can inject a malicious JavaScript payload into the last name field of another user's profile.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user with privileges to edit user profiles.
*   **Impact:** When the victim user's profile page is viewed, the injected JavaScript code executes in their browser. This can lead to session hijacking (stealing cookies), account takeover, and other malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.

**Improper Access Control Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly validate user permissions when accessing project-related documents.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of authorization checks.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user who has had their "Access to all projects" permission revoked can still directly access project URLs and interact with the project, including uploading and downloading attachments.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Any authenticated user, even with restricted project access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive project documents and the ability to upload malicious content to projects the user should not have access to.
