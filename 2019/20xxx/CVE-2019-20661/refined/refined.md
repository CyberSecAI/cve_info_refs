Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   RBR50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
    *   RBS50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
    *   RBK50, running firmware versions prior to 2.3.5.30
*   **Impact:** Not explicitly stated, but XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
*   **Attack Vector:** Stored XSS implies the malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database or configuration file) and executed when a user visits the affected page. The specific attack vector (how the script is injected) isn't detailed in this advisory.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The advisory mentions that the CVSS v3 rating requires High Privileges (PR:H)
*   **Mitigation:** NETGEAR recommends updating to the latest firmware version (2.3.5.30 or later).

The advisory provides a CVSS v3 score:

*   **CVSS v3 Score:** 6.0 (Medium)
*   **CVSS v3 Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

    *   AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   PR:H (Privileges Required: High)
    *   UI:N (User Interaction: None)
    *   S:U (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   C:H (Confidentiality: High)
