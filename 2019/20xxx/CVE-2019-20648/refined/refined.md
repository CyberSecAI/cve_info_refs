- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Security misconfiguration
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A security misconfiguration vulnerability exists in the affected product.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The specific impact is not detailed, but the CVSS vector indicates that the vulnerability could lead to limited compromise of confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors**: The CVSS vector `AV:A` indicates that the attack vector is adjacent, meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same local network as the device. The CVSS vector `PR:L` indicates that the attacker needs low privileges.  The vector `UI:N` indicates no user interaction is required.
