Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the `Link`, `Name`, and `Banner` parameters of the `/partner/index` endpoint of ilchCMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is specifically a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means the malicious script is injected via the URL or POST parameters and reflected back to the user in the application's response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when the page containing the injected script is viewed.
*   **Data theft:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
*   **Malicious actions:** The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user, redirect them to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other harmful actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are the `Link`, `Name`, and `Banner` parameters within the POST request to `/partner/index`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The advisory explicitly states "Auth: No", indicating that the attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious link or submitting a crafted POST request to the vulnerable page in order for the injected script to execute, due to the reflected nature of the XSS. The advisory mentions "UI:R" in the CVSS score, which represents user interaction is required.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker would need to know the vulnerable URL path (`/partner/index`) and the vulnerable parameters (`Link`, `Name`, `Banner`).

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit code is:

`'"@--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(0x00BFFE)</scRipt>`

This payload attempts to break out of HTML context, inject a `<script>` tag, and execute the javascript code `alert(0x00BFFE)`.

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was found in `ilchCMS version 2.1.23`.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity.
*   The issue was fixed by the vendor on July 16th 2019
