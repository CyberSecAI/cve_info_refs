Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-20636:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-20636

**Description:** The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write.

**Root Cause:** Incomplete validation of keycode changes within the Linux kernel's input subsystem. Specifically, the code handling keycode changes did not sufficiently check the validity of the new keycodes.

**Vulnerability:** Heap out-of-bounds write.  If the input device's keycode table contains garbage values that are excessively large, calls to `clear_bit()` with offsets outside the allocated bitmaps could corrupt other kernel objects.

**Attack Vector:** A local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT device (e.g., `/dev/input/event*` or `/dev/tty*`).

**Impact:**

*   Denial of Service (crash or memory corruption)
*   Privilege Escalation (potentially)

**Required Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local user account on the system.
*   Permission to access the device node for an input or VT device.

**Mitigation:**
The patch "Input: add safety guards to input\_set\_keycode()" adds sanity checks to the returned old keycodes, preventing out-of-bounds writes. Specifically:

*   It checks if `old_keycode > KEY_MAX`. If it is, it logs a warning.
*   It checks if `*old_keycode <= KEY_MAX` before calling `__clear_bit`.
*   The patch also adds a check in tty\_port\_link\_device() so that it only links the port if it has not been done yet.
