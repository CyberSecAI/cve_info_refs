### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v0.7...v0.8`

## Description

![@BowenWang](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14265711?u=85e792ca834ea774d4cc3b7d65f7043a82df072e&v=4&size=48)[BowenWang](https://github.com/BowenWang)opened [on Aug 24, 2019](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa/issues/67#issue-484795542)

There is an uninitialized use in mysofa2json, the bug is found in git commit [3dba53f](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa/commit/3dba53f9c14795b109577519a0df2e25e15fcd6a).

To trigger the bug, after compiling the target:

valgrind ./mysofa2json test-input.

PoC input is attached(I have to change the suffix of input to zip because of github's upload regulation, but this input in generated by fuzzer.

[input.zip](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa/files/3537011/input.zip)
