This document describes an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting multiple Netgear router and gateway models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document does not specify the technical root cause of the vulnerability. It only states that an authentication bypass vulnerability exists.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Authentication bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the device's management interface and potentially gain control over the device. The CVSS vector indicates that the confidentiality is low, integrity impact is high, and availability is not impacted

**Attack vectors:** Network-based (AV:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with network access to the vulnerable device (likely local network access, could potentially be remote if the management interface is exposed to the internet). The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction (UI:N)

**Affected devices and firmware:**
* D6200, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.00.34
* D7000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.68
* JR6150, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.18
* PR2000, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.28
* R6050, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.18
* R6120, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.46
* R6220, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.80
* R6260, running firmware versions prior to 1.1.0.64
* R6700v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.36
* R6800, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.36
* R6900v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.36

The document provides the following CVSS v3 score and vector:
CVSS v3 Rating: High
CVSS v3 Score: 7.1
Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N
