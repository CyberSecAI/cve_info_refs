The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, but it does not correspond to CVE-2019-20670. The advisory is for PSV-2018-0549 and is about a different vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. The advisory doesn't specify the exact location/parameter which is vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
The advisory does not specifically detail the impact but exploitation of a stored XSS vulnerability typically allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of impacts such as:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the web page
*   Redirecting the user to a malicious site
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a web interface of affected NETGEAR devices. An attacker needs to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then stored by the application and executed when a user views the affected part of the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious script through the affected web interface. The advisory doesn't describe where the injection point is, but since this is a stored XSS, the malicious script has to be stored within the application in order to impact the victim later.
The CVSS vector suggests the attacker needs high privileges (PR:H).

The advisory is about NETGEAR products RBR50, RBS50 and RBK50 and recommends updating the firmware to versions 2.3.5.30 or later.
