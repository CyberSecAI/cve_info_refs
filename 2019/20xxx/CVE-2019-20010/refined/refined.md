  "CVE-2019-20010": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in GNU LibreDWG 0.92. There is a use-after-free in resolve_objectref_vector in decode.c.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Use-after-free in the `resolve_objectref_vector` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Potential for arbitrary code execution or denial of service due to memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network, by processing a maliciously crafted DWG file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to be processed by a vulnerable version of LibreDWG. This can be done remotely if the application processing the file is accessible over a network.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered while processing DWG files, specifically in `decode.c`. The provided links indicate that this issue was identified through fuzzing."
