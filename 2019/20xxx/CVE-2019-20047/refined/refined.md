Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-20047:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure storage of LDAP bind credentials (used for directory manager access) in the Windows registry and subsequent exposure of these credentials via server-side session files in a public directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Cleartext Credential Storage:** LDAP bind credentials, including the administrator password, are stored in cleartext in the Windows registry.
2.  **Insecure Session Storage:** User session files, which contain the decoded LDAP credentials, are stored in a publicly accessible directory on the web server.
3.  **Reversible Password Encoding:** The password encoding algorithm is easily reversible, allowing for the recovery of the cleartext password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** An attacker can obtain the LDAP bind credentials (directory manager credentials), granting them full administrative control over the system.
- **Account Compromise:** The leaked credentials can be used to further compromise the system, including modification of user accounts, including the `AdminNmc` user, which is the administrator of the PHP web interface.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Access can be used as a pivot point for other attacks on the infrastructure.
- **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (Chained Exploit):** The disclosed credentials, along with other vulnerabilities (such as a post-auth RCE), can be chained to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution, though this is not specific to CVE-2019-20047, but a consequence of it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker can access the vulnerable web application remotely over the network.
- **Publicly Accessible Session Files:** The vulnerability can be exploited by directly accessing the server-side session files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable OmniVista instance.
- **No Authentication Required:**  Exploitation of the credential disclosure vulnerability itself does not require any prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of URL Structure:**  Knowledge of the location of session files is needed.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**
- The provided documents contain details about the vulnerable code, including the `Action::GetAccessParameters()` method that retrieves the credentials and the `DecodePwd` function used to decode the password.
- The content mentions the impact on both OmniVista 4760 and 8770, with the 4760 being deprecated and the 8770 receiving a fix.
- The exploit code, which was made public, shows the full process of exploiting the vulnerability, including reading session files, decoding the credentials, and using those credentials to gain access.

**In summary, CVE-2019-20047 involves the disclosure of administrative credentials due to insecure storage and public accessibility of session files, leading to potential remote compromise of affected systems.**
