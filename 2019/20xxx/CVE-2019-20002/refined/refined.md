- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows users to embed untrusted input within TSV/CSV files. These files can then be interpreted by spreadsheet applications as formulas to be computed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Formula injection vulnerability. The application doesn't sanitize or validate user input, allowing malicious formulas to be injected into exported files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can craft malicious payloads in the vulnerable fields. When the exported CSV file is opened by a user, these payloads can trigger malicious actions such as:
    - Redirecting the user to malicious hyperlinks, potentially leading to phishing or drive-by download attacks.
    - Executing arbitrary commands on the user's machine, via malicious formulas utilizing shell execution (e.g. using powershell).
    - Exfiltrating data by sending data to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious payload in a text field (e.g. ticket subject) of a ticket. When the admin exports the ticket data to TSV/CSV format, the spreadsheet application interprets the payload as a formula when opened, leading to execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the application (e.g. create a ticket with a malicious subject) and an admin user must export data in TSV/CSV format and open it.
