The provided content is related to a commit that addresses a bug in the audience check during JWT verification, which is related to CVE-2019-1020015.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and fix:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stemmed from an incorrect implementation of the JWT audience check in Hasura GraphQL Engine.
- Previously, the code was converting the audience type (which could be a string or a URI) to a plain string before comparing it with the configured value. This resulted in incorrect comparisons and potential bypass of intended authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Type Handling:** The core issue was the improper conversion of the audience field to a string before comparison. The `jose` library expects an `Audience` type which can be string or list of strings and should not be converted to string during comparison.
- **JWT Verification Bypass:** This flaw could allow a user with a JWT containing a different audience to potentially bypass intended authorization checks by providing any audience type which can convert to string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** By crafting a JWT with an audience that would be incorrectly stringified to match the expected value, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.
- **Security Breach:**  This could lead to data leaks, data manipulation, or other security breaches depending on the permissions and access granted to the compromised user role.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious JWT:** The attacker would need to create or manipulate a JWT to include an audience value that would bypass the flawed comparison check.
- **API Request:** The attacker would then use this malicious JWT when making API requests to the Hasura GraphQL engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Forge/Manipulate JWTs:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify JWTs by possessing the private key or exploiting any vulnerabilities in the token generation process.
- **Network Access to Hasura Instance:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Hasura GraphQL engine instance.

**Fix:**

The commit addresses this vulnerability by:
- Using the `Audience` type from the `jose` library for comparing the audience claim in JWT with the audience configured in Hasura.
- Adding support for audience check if the audience is a list of strings
- Adding support for issuer check
- Skipping audience check if not given in configuration

This fix ensures correct audience comparison, preventing the described vulnerability.
