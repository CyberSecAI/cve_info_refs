## Package

npm

parse-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 3.6.0

## Patched versions

3.6.0

## Description

### Impact

Versions prior to 3.6.0 could allow an account enumeration attack via account linking.

`ParseError.ACCOUNT_ALREADY_LINKED(208)` was thrown BEFORE the AuthController checks the password and throws a `ParseError.SESSION_MISSING(206)` for Insufficient auth. An attacker can guess ids and get information about linked accounts/email addresses.

### Patches

The exploit is closed with the release of 3.6.0 of parse-server

### Workarounds

no

### References

Description of [Enumeration Attack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_%28OWASP-AT-002%29#Description_of_the_Issue)
