The provided content describes a security advisory for `stacktable.js` with the GitHub Security Advisory ID GHSA-r9j3-hgxr-75xg. It does not have a corresponding CVE ID assigned. However, the information provided can be analyzed to extract vulnerability details.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper construction of HTML within the JavaScript code of `stacktable.js`. This is related to how the script manipulates existing elements in the DOM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability exists because the script does not properly sanitize or encode user-controlled data when manipulating the DOM to construct new HTML elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is considered high as it's an XSS vulnerability. However, the advisory notes that if the content being manipulated is trusted, the vulnerability is less likely to be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by using malicious content within the existing elements of the web page. The `stacktable.js` library is then used to construct HTML from these tainted elements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to influence the content of elements on the webpage that `stacktable.js` manipulates. This could be achieved via:
   - Injecting malicious HTML into fields or content managed by the application using stacktable.js
   - Compromising a site and injecting malicious content
  - Persuading a user to interact with malicious web content.
