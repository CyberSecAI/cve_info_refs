{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Making a POST request to `/parse/classes/_Audience` or another volatile class results in an internal server error on subsequent POST requests.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability arises from improper handling of POST requests to specific classes, leading to a server-side error state.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Subsequent POST requests after an initial vulnerable POST request will fail with an internal server error (500), causing a denial of service or preventing normal operation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/parse/classes/_Audience` or another volatile class.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated for the POST request to `/parse/classes/_Audience`"
