{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises because Werkzeug's trusted host feature, which `APP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` relies on, does not check the list of trusted hosts in its routing system that `url_for` is relying on.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Host header injection vulnerability. The application may generate incorrect URLs when using `url_for` or Jinja templates if the host header is not validated. This allows for the generation of URLs based on a malicious host header.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially manipulate generated URLs, which can lead to various security issues, including but not limited to: phishing attacks, session hijacking, and bypassing security checks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through crafted HTTP requests containing a malicious `Host` header. This is possible when the webserver is misconfigured to forward requests with invalid Host headers to the application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server with a modified `Host` header. Additionally, the webserver must be configured to route requests with arbitrary `Host` headers to the application."
