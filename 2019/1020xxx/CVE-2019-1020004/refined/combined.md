# Websites can feed Tridactyl fake key events

## Package

Tridactyl
(Firefox add-on)

## Affected versions

1.14.0 <= v <= 1.14.10, 1.15.0

## Patched versions

1.14.12+, 1.16.0+

## Description

### Impact

Malicious websites could feed keys to Tridactyl which it would execute as if a user had pressed them, outside of the command line. If the native messenger was installed, an attacker could execute arbitrary programs by sending the string `mpv <data URI here>` to the user's shell. See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jens1o/962261ef5acbdd19fe779d0113588f59) for a third-party example of how it could have been exploited.

We believe that the vulnerability was not known by any bad actors.

All Tridactyl versions released between September 2018 and June 14th 2019 were affected, i.e. 1.14.0 <= v <= 1.14.10 and 1.15.0.

### Patches

The majority of [our users](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/statistics/usage/versions/?last=7) already have the patch - you can check easily on the new tab or with `:version`. Update to 1.14.12+ (for Firefox ESR) or 1.16.0+ by going to `about:addons` in Firefox, clicking the cog in the top right, and then clicking "Update". Once Tridactyl has downloaded you'll need to restart Firefox. It will look as if the progress bar is stuck - just restart.

### Workarounds

Remove the native messenger - check the output of `:! pwd` and then delete that directory.
