{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The design of SmokeDetector allows for automatic deployment of updated code without server operator authority, enabling remote unrestricted code execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote unrestricted code execution vulnerability due to the automatic update mechanism.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running SmokeDetector, potentially leading to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the server and related systems.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by pushing malicious code updates through the automated deployment system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to contribute to the SmokeDetector project and have their malicious code updates automatically deployed by the system, without the server operator's explicit approval."
