Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1020019 (Although the provided text indicates "No known CVE", it is used as the identifier for this analysis)

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied content within the JSON, Markdown, and iPython Notebook previewers. These previewers were not properly handling embedded scripts within these file types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of user-provided input. Specifically:
    - Malicious scripts can be embedded within JSON, Markdown and iPython Notebook files.
    - These scripts are executed by the victim's browser when previewing the files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
    - A malicious user could upload files with embedded scripts.
    - When other users preview these files, the malicious scripts will execute in their browsers. This could allow attackers to:
      - Steal cookies/session data
      - Redirect users to malicious websites
      - Perform actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
    - Uploading malicious JSON, Markdown, or iPython Notebook files.
    - Users viewing these files through the vulnerable previewers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the system that are then previewed by other users.

**Additional notes:**
    - The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including workarounds and affected versions.
    - It also lists specific file types vulnerable to the exploit, which are JSON, Markdown, and iPython Notebook files.
    - It indicates that version 1.0.0a12 contains the fix.
