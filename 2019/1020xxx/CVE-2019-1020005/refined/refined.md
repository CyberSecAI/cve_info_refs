Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in Jinja templates within the Invenio-Communities module. Specifically, the description and page fields of community creation forms do not prevent users from injecting script tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in two Jinja templates.
- Unsanitized user input in the description and page fields during community creation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the community description and page fields.
- This injected code can be executed in the browsers of other users who view these community pages, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of pages
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker creates a new community.
- Attacker includes `<script>` tags with malicious JavaScript in the description and/or page fields during community creation.
- When other users view the community pages containing the malicious script, the script executes in their browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who is able to create a community.
- They do not need to be in a privileged position on the platform, but just have the ability to create content that is viewed by other users.
