Based on the provided content, the commits with IDs `52387be4a44cdeaca5421ee955ba1343e836bade` and `b8340c6c8e50a71ff1bca9654b9126ca5a84ce9a` address a security vulnerability related to email login and user-api OTP in Discourse. The core issue is the lack of a confirmation screen before completing the login process via email link or user-api OTP.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability and fix:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application was directly logging in users when they clicked on an email link or used a user-api OTP without an intermediate confirmation screen. This lack of confirmation could potentially be exploited if an attacker gained access to a user's email or OTP link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of User Confirmation:** The system was vulnerable to automatic login without explicit user confirmation via email link or OTP, creating an opportunity for unauthorized access if these links were intercepted.
- **Email Link Exploitation:** If an attacker gained access to a user's email, they could potentially use the email login link to directly log into the account without any further confirmation, bypassing any additional security measures in place.
- **User-API OTP Exploitation:**  Similarly, user-api OTP links could be abused to bypass login if an attacker gained access to them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Account Access:** An attacker could potentially gain full access to a user's account without the user's explicit consent.
- **Data Breaches/Compromise:** Access to a user's account could lead to data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, or manipulation of the user's profile.
- **Account Takeovers:** Successful exploitation could lead to full account takeovers, granting an attacker control over the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Link Interception:** An attacker could intercept a user's email containing the login link.
- **User-API OTP Link Theft:** An attacker could obtain the user-api OTP link through various means, such as phishing or access to the user's communication channels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Email Access:** The attacker needs access to the victim's email account or the specific login email containing the email login link.
- **User-API OTP Link Access:** The attacker needs access to a valid user-api OTP link.
- **Network Interception:** (Less likely but possible) The attacker could potentially intercept network traffic containing the email or OTP link.

**Mitigation:**
The commits implement a confirmation screen that requires the user to explicitly confirm their login before the process is completed. This adds a critical step of user authorization, mitigating the described vulnerabilities.

**Changes in the Commit:**
The commits include changes to:
- Javascript controllers, routes, and templates to handle the confirmation screen.
- Stylesheets for the new UI elements.
- Session controller to include logic for displaying the confirmation screen for email and user-api OTP logins, and require the user to submit the form before completing the login.
- Locale files for the new UI strings.
- Update to routes to introduce new routes to support the changes

In summary, the vulnerability allows for unauthorized login via email link or user-api OTP without user confirmation, which can lead to unauthorized account access and potential data breaches. The fix implements a confirmation screen to address this issue, requiring an explicit user action before completing the login.
