{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The implementation of LOGIN authentication for SMTP in Fleet versions prior to 2.1.2 did not enforce STARTTLS, leading to potential exposure of SMTP credentials.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cleartext transmission of SMTP credentials when using LOGIN authentication over an insecure connection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could sniff or perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on SMTP traffic to obtain the credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks, such as sniffing or MITM attacks, targeting insecure SMTP connections.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned within the network to intercept traffic between the Fleet instance and the SMTP server. No prior authentication is required."
