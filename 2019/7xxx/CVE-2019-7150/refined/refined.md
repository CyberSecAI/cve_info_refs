  "CVE-2019-7150": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in elfutils 0.175. A segmentation fault can occur in the function elf64_xlatetom in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c, due to dwfl_segment_report_module not checking whether the dyn data read from a core file is truncated. A crafted input can cause a program crash, leading to denial-of-service, as demonstrated by eu-stack.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by `dwfl_segment_report_module` not verifying if dynamic data read from a core file is truncated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of data read from a core file leading to out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted input can cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a program crash and denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted ELF files",
        "Processing of core files with incomplete or truncated data"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted core file or ELF file to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered during processing of core files with incomplete or truncated dynamic data. The vulnerable function is `elf64_xlatetom` or `elf32_xlatetom` in `libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c`."
