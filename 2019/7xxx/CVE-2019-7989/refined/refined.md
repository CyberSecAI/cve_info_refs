The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-7989, affecting Adobe Photoshop when processing JSX files. These vulnerabilities stem from a lack of user interface warnings when specific ExtendScript methods are used, leading to potential remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial-of-service.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1.  Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:**  Insufficient UI warnings when handling specific ExtendScript methods within JSX files.
*   **Weakness:** The user interface fails to warn the user about potentially unsafe actions when opening a malicious JSX file.
*   **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** User interaction is required, typically by opening a malicious JSX file or visiting a malicious page.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs to create a malicious JSX file with a specific ExtendScript method that can execute arbitrary code.
*   **Specific methods affected**:
    *   `File.execute`
    *   `File.writeln`
    *   `Folder.rename`
    *   `app.system`
    *   `File.copy`
    *   `File.write`
    *   `File.rename`

**2. Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient UI warnings when handling specific ExtendScript methods within JSX files.
*  **Weakness:** The user interface fails to warn the user about potentially unsafe actions when opening a malicious JSX file.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to disclose sensitive information within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** User interaction is required, typically by opening a malicious JSX file or visiting a malicious page.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs to create a malicious JSX file with a specific ExtendScript method to read information.
*   **Specific methods affected**:
    *   `File.readln`
    *   `File.readch`
    *   `File.read`

**3. Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient UI warnings when handling specific ExtendScript methods within JSX files.
*  **Weakness:** The user interface fails to warn the user about potentially unsafe actions when opening a malicious JSX file.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to trigger a denial-of-service condition by deleting files in the context of the current process.
*   **Attack Vectors:** User interaction is required, typically by opening a malicious JSX file or visiting a malicious page.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Attacker needs to create a malicious JSX file with a specific ExtendScript method that deletes files.
*   **Specific methods affected**:
    *    `Folder.remove`
    *   `File.remove`

**Summary of affected methods and impact:**

*   `File.readln`: Information Disclosure
*   `File.readch`: Information Disclosure
*    `File.read`: Information Disclosure
*   `File.execute`: Remote Code Execution
*   `File.writeln`: Remote Code Execution
*    `Folder.rename`: Remote Code Execution
*    `app.system`: Remote Code Execution
*    `File.copy`: Remote Code Execution
*   `File.write`: Remote Code Execution
*   `File.rename`: Remote Code Execution
*   `Folder.remove`: Denial of Service
*   `File.remove`: Denial of Service

**Additional Notes:**

*   All of these vulnerabilities require user interaction to be exploited.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite.
*   Adobe has released updates to address these issues.
*   The vulnerabilities were addressed in Photoshop CC versions 19.1.9 and 20.0.6.

In summary, CVE-2019-7989 is an umbrella for several vulnerabilities in Adobe Photoshop, all stemming from insufficient UI warnings when processing JSX files and utilizing certain ExtendScript methods. These vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial-of-service, depending on the specific method invoked.
