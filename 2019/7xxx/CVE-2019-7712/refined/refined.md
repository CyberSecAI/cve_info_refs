Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7712:

**CVE-2019-7712: Interpeak IPCOMShell PWD Command Handler Format String Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `pwd` command handler of the Interpeak IPCOMShell within Green Hills INTEGRITY RTOS. When the user executes the `pwd` command, the current working directory path is directly passed as the first argument to the `printf` function without proper sanitization or format string handling.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Format String Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the use of a user-controlled string (the current working directory path) as the format string in `printf`. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%s`, `%n`) into the path, leading to various security issues.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Leak:** An attacker can use format string specifiers like `%x` to read data from the stack or other memory locations, potentially leaking sensitive information like memory addresses, stack contents, and other process-related data.
    *   **Denial of Service:** By using specifiers like `%n`, the attacker can overwrite memory with a count of bytes written so far. This can lead to memory corruption, program crashes, or denial of service.
    *   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in this analysis, format string vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other techniques to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the IPCOMShell interface. This would typically be through a console, serial port, or network connection that provides access to the command shell.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to issue commands to the Interpeak IPCOMShell.
    *   The attacker needs to know (or be able to discover) a file path that contains format string specifiers and also be able to navigate to the directory.
    *  The vulnerability exists in the `pwd` command handler, which is typically a low-privilege command within the shell; therefore, the attacker does not need escalated privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary**

The core of the vulnerability is the unchecked use of the current directory path as a format string in `printf`. This allows an attacker to potentially read arbitrary memory, cause a denial of service, or possibly gain code execution. The primary attack vector is through the shell interface using the `pwd` command.
