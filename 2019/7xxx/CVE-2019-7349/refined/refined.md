The provided content relates to CVE-2019-7349.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `monitor.php` view in ZoneMinder insecurely prints the `newMonitor[V4LCapturesPerFrame]` value on the webpage without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper output encoding of user-supplied data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the site, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to `index.php` with the `view=monitor` and a malicious payload in the `newMonitor[V4LCapturesPerFrame]` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable ZoneMinder instance. No specific user privileges are mentioned as required for the exploitation to be successful.

**More Detail:**
The vulnerability is specifically in how the `newMonitor[V4LCapturesPerFrame]` parameter is handled. The provided example shows the payload `"><img src=x onerror=prompt('1');>` which demonstrates a working XSS attack.
