  "cveId": "CVE-2019-7578",
  "description": "SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9 has a heap-based buffer over-read in InitIMA_ADPCM in audio/SDL_wave.c.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "A heap-based buffer over-read occurs in the `InitIMA_ADPCM` function within the `audio/SDL_wave.c` file of the SDL library. This occurs when the parsing of an IMA ADPCM format chunk is performed, and the chunk is too short, causing the function to read past the end of the chunk data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash or denial of service due to the out-of-bounds read.",
    "attackVector": "The attack vector is through the processing of a crafted audio file using SDL. The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted WAV file to the application using the affected SDL version.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must be able to provide a crafted audio file to a user or application that uses the vulnerable SDL library. This can be achieved through various means like tricking a user to open the file, or the file being processed by an application that takes untrusted user input.",

        "SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15",
