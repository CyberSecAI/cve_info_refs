**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF) issue that exists within AcroForm.api, specifically when parsing XFA forms.
* The core issue stems from a lack of validation to ensure that an object exists before an attempt is made to perform operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Use-After-Free:  The software attempts to access memory after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.
