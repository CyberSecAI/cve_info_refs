- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-memory issue occurs when the `AP4_Array<AP4_CttsTableEntry>::EnsureCapacity` function in `Ap4Array.h` attempts to allocate a very large amount of memory (0x6eff83000 bytes) due to a large size calculation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an uncontrolled resource consumption (out-of-memory) issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The program crashes due to the inability to allocate the required memory. This denial-of-service condition prevents the program from functioning correctly.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file. The provided "POC.zip" contains the file that causes the issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to the `mp4dump` program. No specific privileges are required beyond the ability to execute the program with user-supplied input.
