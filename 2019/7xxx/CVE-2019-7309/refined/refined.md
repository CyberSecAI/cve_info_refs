Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `memcmp` function within the glibc library when compiled for the x32 architecture. The `memcmp` implementation used signed jump condition codes (`jle`, `jge`) to check the size argument, which is of the `size_t` type, an unsigned integer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Size Handling:** When the most significant bit of the size argument (stored in the `RDX` register) was set, the signed comparisons interpreted it as a negative value. This caused the comparison logic to effectively treat the size as zero.
- **Type Mismatch:** The core issue was using signed jump instructions to compare an unsigned size, which is a fundamental type mismatch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Comparison Results:** The vulnerability caused `memcmp` to incorrectly return 0 (equal) even when the compared memory regions were different. This behavior could have severe consequences because `memcmp` is a fundamental function in many applications for comparing data.
- **Potential for Wider Vulnerabilities:** An attacker might have leveraged the incorrect behavior to bypass security checks or cause application errors by exploiting the incorrect comparison result.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability could be triggered by an attacker supplying a size argument to `memcmp` where the most significant bit is set. This could be achieved indirectly through controlled lengths passed to other functions using `memcmp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over Size Argument:**  The attacker needed to control, directly or indirectly, the size argument passed to `memcmp`. This could be done by controlling buffer lengths passed to functions that internally call `memcmp`.
- **x32 Target Architecture:** The vulnerability was specific to the x32 architecture.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in `sysdeps/x86_64/memcmp.S`
- The problematic code used `test %rdx, %rdx`, and then signed jump instructions `jle` and `jge` to check the size in `rdx` register.
- The fix involved using unsigned jump instructions, clearing the upper 32 bits of RDX for the x32 architecture, and using `RDX_LP` for size.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was triggered on x32, where the `RDX` register is 64-bit, and using a large size value with the most significant bit set would cause the signed check to fail.
- The bug was fixed in glibc 2.30 and backported to older branches (2.24, 2.25, 2.26, 2.27, 2.28, and 2.29).
- The `memcmp` function would return 0 on x32 if the most significant bit of the size was set due to the incorrect signed comparison, which is similar to calling `memcmp(a, b, 0)`.
- A new testcase `tst-size_t-memcmp-2.c` was added.

In summary, CVE-2019-7309 was a type mismatch vulnerability in glibc's `memcmp` implementation on x32, that caused incorrect size checks due to the use of signed comparison on unsigned values. An attacker could exploit this by providing a large size value (with most significant bit set) that caused memcmp to effectively compare zero bytes, leading to potential security vulnerabilities due to incorrect comparison results.
