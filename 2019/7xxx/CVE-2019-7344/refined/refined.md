The provided content describes a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ZoneMinder's `filter.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application insecurely displays the "Filter name" without proper output filtration. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script through the `filter[Name]` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the victim's browser when they access a crafted URL. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement of the web page, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload within the `filter[Name]` parameter. The payload is then reflected back and executed by the user's browser when the page is loaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL that targets the vulnerable `filter.php` endpoint. They do not require authentication or prior access, and can potentially trick users into visiting the URL.
