The provided content describes a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ZoneMinder's `export.php` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `export.php` script does not properly sanitize the `exportFile` parameter before including it in the webpage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which can then be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the web page
- Redirection to malicious websites
- Stealing of sensitive information
- Other malicious actions in the userâ€™s browser

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can craft a malicious URL with a payload in the `exportFile` parameter and send it to a victim.
- The victim would then have to navigate to the malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
- The victim needs to be enticed to click on the URL or have the URL be loaded automatically.
