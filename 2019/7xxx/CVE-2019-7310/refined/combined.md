# Heap buffer overflow in XRef::getEntry due to integer overflow

Hey guys,

I recently found the following heap overflow in the pdftocairo:

Looks like, if variable `i` is negative it causes `entries[i].type == xrefEntryNone` be executed. You can find a reproducer in the attachment.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1683632#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-02-27 12:23:37 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer underwrite exists in ImageStream::getLine() located at Stream.cc in Poppler 0.74.0 that can (for example) be triggered by sending a crafted PDF file to the pdfimages binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.

Several issues were found and corrected in Poppler, a PDF rendering library,
that could lead to denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact when
processing maliciously crafted documents.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.48.0-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

For the detailed security status of poppler please refer to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1665273#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-10 20:19:04 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Poppler 0.72.0. The PDFDoc::setup class in PDFDoc.cc allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash caused by Object.h SIGABRT, because of a wrong return value from PDFDoc::setup) by crafting a PDF file in which an xref data structure is mishandled during extractPDFSubtype processing.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1672419#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-02-04 21:32:38 UTC  ``` In Poppler 0.73.0, a heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer signedness error in the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document, as demonstrated by pdftocairo.

Could then return a negative entry back to the caller.  Unclear if this could lead to code execution, but rated the CVSS a bit higher to account for my uncertainty.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1672419#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:03:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2022 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2022](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2022)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1672419#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-06 13:21:49 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Debian Bug     : 913177 917325 918158 921215 923414

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in the poppler PDF
rendering shared library.

CVE-2018-19058

    A reachable abort in Object.h will lead to denial-of-service because
    EmbFile::save2 in FileSpec.cc lacks a stream check before saving an
    embedded file.

CVE-2018-20481

    Poppler mishandles unallocated XRef entries, which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial-of-service (NULL pointer dereference)
    via a crafted PDF document.

CVE-2018-20662

    Poppler allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application
    crash and segmentation fault by crafting a PDF file in which an xref
    data structure is corrupted.

CVE-2019-7310

    A heap-based buffer over-read (due to an integer signedness error in
    the XRef::getEntry function in XRef.cc) allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact via a crafted PDF document.

CVE-2019-9200

    A heap-based buffer underwrite exists in ImageStream::getLine()
    located at Stream.cc that can (for example) be triggered by sending
    a crafted PDF file to the pdfimages binary. It allows an attacker to
    cause denial-of-service (segmentation fault) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.26.5-2+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.
