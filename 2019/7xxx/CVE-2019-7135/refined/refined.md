Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-7135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of TIF (Tagged Image File Format) files within Adobe Bridge CC.
*   Specifically, it stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the TIF file. This insufficient validation allows for an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected system. This means an attacker could potentially read data from memory that they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Potential for Code Execution (in conjunction with other vulnerabilities):**  While this specific vulnerability is primarily for information disclosure, the advisory notes that it can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted malicious TIF file using Adobe Bridge CC.
*   **Malicious Page:** The advisory also mentions that user interaction is required, suggesting that visiting a malicious web page could also trigger the vulnerability, possibly if the webpage could cause Adobe Bridge to parse a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious TIF file or host content on a webpage that will trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker requires a user to interact with the malicious file or content (e.g., by opening the file or browsing to a specific web page) in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Francis Provencher, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   Adobe has released an update (version 9.0.3) to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Adobe.
* The CVSS score is 5.5, with vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
