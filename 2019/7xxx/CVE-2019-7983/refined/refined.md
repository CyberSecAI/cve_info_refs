- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Adobe Photoshop CC.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, but successful exploitation would require the user to open a specially crafted file with vulnerable versions of Photoshop CC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to create a malicious file that, when opened by the user in Adobe Photoshop, would trigger the out-of-bounds write condition. The attacker would require the user to open the malicious file in order to execute arbitrary code on their machine.
