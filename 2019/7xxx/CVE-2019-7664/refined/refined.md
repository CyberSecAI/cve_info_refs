{
  "CVE-2019-7664": {
    "Description": "Out of bound write in elf_cvt_note in libelf/note_xlate.h",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect overflow check in the `elf_cvt_note` function within `libelf/note_xlate.h`. The code checks if there is enough room for the note header, but the size calculation for the header is incorrect. It uses a hardcoded value of 8 bytes when it should be using the size of the `cvt_Nhdr` struct which is 12 bytes. This leads to a negative size when calling memcpy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect size calculation",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Missing or inadequate overflow check"
    ],
    "Impact": "Crafted ELF input leads to a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service (program crash). This is due to a negative-sized `memcpy` operation in `elf_cvt_note`.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious ELF file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted ELF file to a program using the vulnerable `elfutils` library, specifically when processing notes. Specifically, `eu-elflint` is a tool that can be used to trigger this vulnerability. Running `eu-readelf -n` on a core file can also trigger it, provided the core file has a `NT_PLATFORM` note with a non-zero terminated string."
