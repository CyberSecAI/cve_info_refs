Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the coordinate and region map visualizations within Kibana.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code through map visualizations. While Content Security Policy (CSP) is enabled by default, it doesn't completely mitigate the issue. Attackers can still inject arbitrary HTML into the page.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability arises from inadequate sanitization of user-provided data when rendering map visualizations. This allows the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the browser of a user viewing the malicious visualization or dashboard containing it.
*   **HTML Injection:** Even with CSP, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the page.
*   **Potential Consequences:**  This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Visualization Creation:** An attacker must be able to create coordinate map visualizations within Kibana.
*   **Victim Interaction:**  The attacker needs to entice a victim to view the malicious visualization or a dashboard that contains it. This can be achieved through social engineering or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Kibana Access:** The attacker must have access to Kibana to create visualizations.
*   **Privilege Level:** The attacker needs the ability to create coordinate and region map visualizations within Kibana.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to interact with the malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to upgrade Kibana to version 7.5.1 or 6.8.6. If an upgrade is not feasible, users can disable map visualizations using configuration options in `kibana.yml`.
*   **CSP Bypassing:** The document mentions that although CSP is enabled, it doesn't fully mitigate this vulnerability, specifically mentioning that attackers can still inject arbitrary HTML.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 score of 7.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N), which indicates a high severity.
