Learn about the latest improvements in Adobe Commerce, including enhancements, security, bug fixes, and known issues.

NOTE

Although code for enhancements and bug fixes described in these release notes is bundled with Adobe Commerce, several of these projects (for example, B2B, Page Builder, and Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Studio) are also released independently. Bug fixes for these projects are documented in the separate, project-specific release information that is available in the documentation for each project. See [product release overview](/en/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/overview).

NOTE

Adobe Commerce releases can contain backward-incompatible changes (BICs). To review backward-incompatible changes, see [BIC reference](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/backward-incompatible-changes/reference/). Major backward-incompatible issues are described in [BIC highlights](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/backward-incompatible-changes/highlights/). Not all releases introduce major BICs.
