RELATED: CVE-2019-7328
  
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `frame` view in ZoneMinder insecurely prints the `scale` parameter value on the webpage without proper filtration, leading to XSS.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `scale` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on a specially crafted URL.
