Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Asterisk handles SDP (Session Description Protocol) negotiation during outgoing calls. Specifically, a remote party can send a malformed SDP response that violates the protocol by offering a codec not present in Asterisk's original offer. This leads to a scenario where Asterisk tries to process RTP packets for a codec it hasn't negotiated, causing a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SDP Protocol Violation Handling:** Asterisk fails to properly handle a remote peer's SDP response when the peer offers a codec that was not originally requested, leading to an invalid state and subsequent crash.
- **Missing Error Check:** The code does not properly check if the stream number is valid after failed SDP negotiation, causing an attempt to access an invalid memory location through `ast_stream_topology_get_stream`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit results in a crash of the Asterisk process (segfault), causing disruption to the service. This can affect call handling and other functions provided by the Asterisk system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Authenticated Sessions:** An attacker needs to establish a connection to Asterisk to initiate an outgoing call to a malicious endpoint.
- **SDP Manipulation:** The attacker needs to control the remote endpoint to send a specific malformed SDP response (180 Ringing with a codec not offered).
- **RTP Stream:** The attacker has to send a RTP stream of the non negotiated codec.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to make calls through an Asterisk instance, either through direct access or by using a service that relies on Asterisk.
- The attacker needs to control the remote endpoint that the call is being directed to and send manipulated SIP/SDP responses and RTP stream.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is triggered when the remote party responds with a 180 Ringing message containing a different codec than what was offered in the initial INVITE and starts streaming RTP with the non-negotiated codec.
- The vulnerability affects Asterisk versions 15.x and 16.x.
- Patches have been released to address the vulnerability. These patches prevent frames from reaching the channel.c when the SDP negotiation fails.
