Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the processing of PostScript files in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This occurs because the software fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it. Specifically, the `grestore` operator in PostScript is implicated in triggering this vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-After-Free: The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when an application attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable behavior.
- Lack of Input Validation: The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper input validation of the PostScript file, specifically the `grestore` operator usage and the object being acted upon by the `grestore` operator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user's process. This means an attacker can potentially gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PostScript File: An attacker crafts a malicious PostScript file that, when processed by Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
- User Interaction: Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically opening or viewing the malicious PostScript file. This could be achieved by luring a victim to open the malicious document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted PostScript file.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs the user to open the malicious PostScript file in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is triggered when processing PostScript files.
- The ZDI advisory provides a concise description of the vulnerability, while the Adobe security bulletin provides additional details about the affected versions and remediation.
- The Adobe bulletin lists this as a critical severity vulnerability.
- The advisory mentions that Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Source Incite reported the vulnerability to Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
