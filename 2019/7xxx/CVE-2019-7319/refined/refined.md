  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "When using either the LdapBackend or the SAML2Backend authentication backends in Hue, users that are created on login when logging in for the first time are granted superuser privileges in CDH 6.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect permission assignment on user creation"
    ],
    "impact": "Users logging into Hue for the first time are granted superuser privileges. For SAML2Backend users, this enables the creation/deletion of users and groups, assignment of users to groups, and alteration of group permissions. LdapBackend users can sync Hue users with LDAP, create local users and groups, assign users to groups, and alter group permissions.",

      "An attacker gains superuser access by creating a user via LdapBackend or SAML2Backend authentication upon login"
