- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure use of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol when handling Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure protocol implementation. Specifically, the application's handling of UNC paths using SMB.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive data disclosure can occur if the SMB request is intercepted by a relay attack.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs when Dreamweaver processes UNC paths, potentially leading to an SMB request being initiated which an attacker can intercept.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to perform a relay attack on SMB traffic generated by Dreamweaver.
