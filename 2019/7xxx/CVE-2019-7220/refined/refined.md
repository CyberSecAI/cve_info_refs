The provided content relates to CVE-2019-7220 and contains vulnerability information.

*   **Vulnerability**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause**: The web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.
*   **Attack Vector**:
    *   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a website.
    *   The script is executed by the end user's browser because it appears to come from a trusted source.
*   **Impact**:
    *   The malicious script can access cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site.
    *   The scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the web application.
*   **Steps to reproduce**:
    1.  Log into the demo store of X-Cart.com
    2.  Browse the following URL: `https://demostore.x-cart.com/themes/igoods/?sortBy=p.arrivalDate&sortOrder=asc&sessionCell=XLiteModuleXCProductFilterViewItemsListProductCustomerCategoryCategoryFilter2"><script>alert(1)</script>`
    3.  An XSS popup alert will appear.
*   **Mitigation**: Apply context-dependent output encoding. Encode HTML special characters or apply correct URL encoding. Disallow links that don't begin with a whitelisted protocol.
