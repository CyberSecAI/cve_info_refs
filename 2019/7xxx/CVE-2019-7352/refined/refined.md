The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in ZoneMinder v1.33.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `Run State` view in ZoneMinder does not perform input validation on the `New State` field.
- The value provided in the `New State` field is directly stored in the database without sanitization or escaping of special characters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Lack of input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `New State` field.
- This code is then stored in the database and executed when a user views the `Run State`, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the web application
  - Other malicious activities, such as redirecting users to phishing sites, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the `/zm/index.php` endpoint with the malicious payload in the `newState` parameter.
- The attacker can trigger the stored XSS by navigating to the `Run State` view after the payload is saved in the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the `/zm/index.php` endpoint with a malicious script in the `newState` parameter.
- The attacker does not appear to require any special privileges.
