- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ABB IDAL HTTP server CGI interface contains a URL that allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `/cgi/loginDefaultUser` URL creates a session in an authenticated state, returning the session ID, username, and plaintext password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to privileged functions, such as restarting the service using `/cgi/restart`.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a GET request to `/cgi/loginDefaultUser` to retrieve the credentials, or including the `IDALToken` in a cookie.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the affected system through the network. The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
