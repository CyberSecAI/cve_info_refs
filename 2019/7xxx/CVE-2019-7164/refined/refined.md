Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7164:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how python-SQLAlchemy handles user-controlled input passed directly to the `order_by` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to unsanitized input in the `order_by` parameter of SQLAlchemy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
-  This could lead to complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's interface where the `order_by` parameter can be influenced using malicious input.
- Network-based attacks are possible by manipulating HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `order_by` parameter in SQLAclhemy.
-  No authentication or prior privileges are needed in some cases.
- Some scenarios might require user interaction, depending on the specific application using the vulnerable library.
- Exploitation can occur over a network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in SQLAlchemy versions up to 1.2.17 and 1.3.x through 1.3.0b2.
- The issue was fixed in versions 1.2.18 and 1.3.0b3.
- This CVE is closely related to CVE-2019-7548, which involves the `group_by` parameter.
- The identified vulnerability was present in multiple systems and products, necessitating updates across various distributions, such as Red Hat, SUSE, and openSUSE.
- The fix for this vulnerability may break the text coercion feature, a rare use case.
- The vulnerability can be exploited even when the application is running in an environment with a read-only database, as the injected SQL might allow data exfiltration using UNION-based techniques or the database's built-in tools.
