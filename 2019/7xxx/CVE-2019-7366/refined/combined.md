## Autodesk Trust Center

### Security advisory

Advisories are used to communicate information related to vulnerabilities identified with Autodesk® products and services. This includes any fixes or workarounds that are applicable to the affected product.

## Vulnerability in the Autodesk® FBX Software Development Kit

---

**Autodesk ID:** ADSK-SA-2019-0003

**Product, Service, Component:** Autodesk® FBX Software Development Kit

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution

**Severity:** High

**Original Publish:** 30/10/2019

**Last Revised:** 30/10/2019

| Severity | CVSS Score | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | A vulnerability where scope and impact of exploitation is restricted and the ability to exploit is extremely difficult. |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | A vulnerability where exploitation is mitigated by factors such as difficulty to exploit, default configuration or ease of identification. |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | A vulnerability, which if exploited, would directly impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of user's data or processing resources. |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10 | A vulnerability, which if exploited, would allow remote execution of malicious code without user action. |

### Summary

FBX is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability which may lead to arbitrary code execution on a system running it. A Security Fix is available via the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0).

### Description

The details of the vulnerability are as follows:

1. CVE-2019-7366: A user may be tricked into opening a malicious FBX file which may exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in FBX’s SDK causing it to run arbitrary code on the system.

### Affected Products

**Item:** FBX-SDK

**Impacted Versions:** 2019.5

**Mitigated Versions:** 2020.0

**Update Source:** [FBX SDK 2020.0](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0)

*\*Note: Product list table contents subject to change.*

### Recommendations

Autodesk highly recommends that customers of the affected products obtain and apply the latest Security Fix for their products via the [Autodesk Knowledge Network](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0). For third party developers who use the FBX-SDK in their applications or services, Autodesk highly recommends they obtain and apply the latest version of the FBX-SDK from the update source listed above.

### Acknowledgements

Autodesk was made aware of this vulnerability by a third-party security researcher, along with a second vulnerability, that reported against one of our sample/tutorial codes and not the production FBX 2019.5 Software Development Kit. It was related to example sample code not catching an exception; however, the SDK does the correct thing here: it throws an exception. The sample code is not intended to be production code and should not be used as such – to this end, it poses no risk to production environments.

### Related Information

The following CVE has been reserved as a result of the remediation activities. Details regarding the CVE are available here: [https://cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/)

* CVE-2019-7366: FBX Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
