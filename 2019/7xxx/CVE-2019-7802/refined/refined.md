Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PostScript files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This insufficient validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: The application reads data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive information from the memory of the vulnerable system.
- Potential for Code Execution: The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PostScript Files: An attacker can craft a malicious PostScript file that, when opened by the victim in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, triggers the vulnerability.
- Malicious Web Pages: An attacker could host a malicious web page that, when visited by the victim, exploits the vulnerability by delivering a malicious PostScript file.
- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious PostScript files.
- Ability to deliver these malicious files to the victim, either through a webpage or by convincing them to open it locally.
- No special privileges required on the victim's system, the exploit runs with the permissions of the user opening the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in a security update released by Adobe.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Adobe.
- The vulnerability is associated with CVE-2019-7802.
