CVE-2019-7652:

- Vulnerability: SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery)
- Affected component: Unshortenlink 1.0 analyzer in TheHive Project's Cortex
- Root cause: The Unshortenlink analyzer did not properly sanitize user-provided URLs, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.
- Attack vector: An attacker with access to a Cortex instance and the 'analyze' role can exploit the vulnerability by providing a malicious URL to the Unshortenlink analyzer.
- Impact:
  - An attacker can scan the ports of localhost and potentially other hosts reachable by the Cortex instance.
  - An attacker can perform reconnaissance by identifying open ports.
- Required capabilities: Access to a Cortex instance with the 'analyze' role. The attacker could automate the attack using Cortex4py to scan multiple ports and hosts.
- Fix: Version 1.1 of Unshortenlink, included in Cortex-Analyzers 1.15.2, addresses this vulnerability by disabling submissions containing IPs & ports. Only URLs are now accepted.
