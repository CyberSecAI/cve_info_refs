CVE-2019-7590: Unquoted Search Path or Element in Johnson Controls exacqVision Server

- Root cause of vulnerability: The exacqVision VMS software suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting the services 'exacqVisionServer', 'dvrdhcpserver' and 'mdnsresponder' for Windows.
- Weakness: Unquoted service path. An authenticated local user can insert code in the system root path, allowing code execution during application startup or reboot.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges. A successful attempt would allow a local user to execute code with the elevated privileges of the application.
- Attack vector: A local user inserts code in the system root path.
- Required attacker capabilities: An authorized but non-privileged local user must be able to insert code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications.
