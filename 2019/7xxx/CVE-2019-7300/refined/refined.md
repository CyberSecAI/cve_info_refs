### Vulnerability Details for Artica Proxy RCE (based on the provided content):

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   **Location:** Artica Proxy
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **Version 3.06:** The application contains a webshell that can be exploited after authentication.
    *   **Prior versions:** Email notification settings allow command injection. By manipulating email parameters, an attacker can inject OS commands that get executed, leading to remote code execution.
    *   Settings file accessible without authentication
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  **Settings file:** Obtain credentials by accessing the settings.inc file containing the `ldap_admin` and `ldap_password`.
    2.  **Authentication:** Use the credentials to log in to the Artica Proxy panel. Default credentials can also be used.
    3.  **Command Injection (Prior versions):** Navigate to the eMail notifications section and inject OS commands into the parameters.
    4.  **Webshell (Version 3.06):** Use the authenticated session to access the webshell and execute commands.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution as root.
*   **Affected Versions:** Artica Proxy versions prior to the "latest" version (3.06), and 3.06 itself.
*   **Attacker Requirements:**
    *   Network access to the Artica Proxy instance.
    *   For versions prior to 3.06, the attacker needs to find a way to trigger the email notification to execute the injected commands.
    *   For 3.06, valid credentials are required, but these can be obtained through remote retrieval of the settings file.
*   **Exploitation Steps:**
    1.  Access the Artica Proxy web interface.
    2.  Retrieve the LDAP credentials from the `settings.inc` file.
    3.  Login to the admin panel using retrieved or default credentials.
    4.  For versions prior to 3.06, inject OS commands in the eMail notifications settings. For version 3.06, use the webshell.
    5.  Trigger the execution of the injected commands (e.g., by sending a test email or saving the settings).
*   **Code Snippet (aRtiCE.py):** The provided Python script automates the process of retrieving credentials and exploiting the vulnerability. It performs the following actions:
    1.  Sends an initial request to the target Artica Proxy instance.
    2.  Attempts to retrieve the `settings.inc` file.
    3.  Extracts the `ldap_admin` and `ldap_password` from the `settings.inc` file using regular expressions.
    4.  Attempts to log in to the admin panel using default credentials.
