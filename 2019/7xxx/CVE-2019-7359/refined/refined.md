The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7359.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper handling of cell margins when opening a malicious DXF file. The code attempts to populate an AcCellMargin object with excessive margins, leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow: The vulnerability allows writing beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the heap overflow vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves an attacker convincing a victim to open a malicious DXF file crafted with excessive cell margins.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious DXF file. The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the crafted DXF file.
