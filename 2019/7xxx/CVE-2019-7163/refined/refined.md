Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-7163:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Alcatel LINKZONE MW40-V-V1.0 does not properly implement authentication for its web interface. The front-end relies on a `GetLoginState` request to determine if a user is logged in. However, this check is purely client-side. The server does not actually verify authentication and always provides the `_TclRequestVerificationToken` regardless of authentication status. The front-end checks the `State` parameter from the response of this request to determine if the user is logged in or not, which can be easily bypassed by manipulating the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The web interface lacks proper server-side authentication checks. It relies on a client-side check of a login state which can be manipulated.
*   **Insecure token generation:** The `_TclRequestVerificationToken` is provided without requiring authentication, making it useless as a security measure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Complete takeover of the web interface:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism and gain full access to the router's web interface.
*   **Access to sensitive information:** The attacker can obtain sensitive information like the Wi-Fi password.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker on the same network as the router (e.g., connected to the Wi-Fi) can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable router.
*   The attacker must be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses, typically through a proxy or other network manipulation tools.
*   The attacker needs to intercept the response to the `GetLoginState` request and modify the value of the `State` parameter from `0` to `1`

**Additional Notes**
* The web interface is not password-protected by default, which simplifies the exploitation of this vulnerability.
* The article mentions that the front-end is downloaded on the first visit and communicates with the back-end via JSON-RPC.
