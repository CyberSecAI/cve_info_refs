Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-7136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error within the parsing of PDF files by Adobe Bridge CC. Specifically, the software fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when a program attempts to use a memory location after it has been freed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information from the affected system.
- **Code Execution (with other vulnerabilities):** While this specific vulnerability leads to information disclosure, it's also mentioned that an attacker could leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PDF File:**  An attacker could craft a malicious PDF file designed to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability when parsed by Adobe Bridge CC.
- **Malicious Web Page:** The vulnerability can also be triggered by visiting a malicious web page, although the details of how the PDF parsing is involved are not given.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file or entice the user to visit a malicious page.
- User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, as the target user must open the malicious PDF file or visit the malicious page in order for the exploit to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Bridge CC versions 9.0.2 and earlier on both Windows and macOS.
- Adobe released a patch in version 9.0.3 to address this and other vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was reported by Francis Provencher of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
