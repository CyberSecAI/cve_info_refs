# Exploit Title: cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_cart in the WooCommerce PayPal Checkout Payment Gateway plugin 1.6.8 for WordPress allows Parameter Tampering in an amount parameter (such as amount_1), as demonstrated by purchasing an item for lower than the intended price
# Date: 27.01.2019
# Product Title :Woocommerce Paypal gateway Plugin
# Vendor Homepage: https://wordpress.org
# Software Link  : https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-express-checkout/
# Category: Web Applications Plugin (Wordpress)
# Version: 1.6.8
# Active installations: 700,000+
# Exploit Author: Vikas Chaudhary
# Contact: https://gkaim.com/contact-us/
# Web:  https://gkaim.com/
# Tested on: Windows 10 -Firefox .
# CVE-2019-7441
*****************************************************
## VENDOR  SUMMARY :-  This is a PayPal Checkout Payment Gateway for WooCommerce.
PayPal Checkout allows you to securely sell your products and subscriptions online using In-Context Checkout to help you meet security requirements without causing your theme to suffer. In-Context Checkout uses a modal window, hosted on PayPalís servers, that overlays the checkout form and provides a secure means for your customers to enter their account information

## Vulnerability Description => The Web Parameter Tampering attack is based on the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server in order to modify application data, such as user credentials and permissions, price and quantity of products, etc. Usually, this information is stored in cookies, hidden form fields, or URL Query Strings, and is used to increase application functionality and control.
This attack can be performed by a malicious user who wants to exploit the application for their own benefit, or an attacker who wishes to attack a third-person using a Man-in-the-middle attack. In both cases, tools likes Webscarab and Paros proxy are mostly used.
__________________________________
Proof Of Concept:- PoC
1 -Install Woocommerce Paypal checkout gateway plugin (1.6.8) in Remote.
2- Now fix a price of any product  and configure it with this plguin.
3- Do checkout through paypal and capture the data from burp.
5- Here you will find post based request with amount parameter- Now Edit amount parameter as you want and forward it .
6- You will see a new price and you can purchase that product on your new edited price.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

  Hello,

  The WPVulnDB lists a security-issue with the plugin up to the newest version 1.6.17. Will there be a fix for this soon?

  <https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9546>

  Best regards

  Heiko

  I wouldn’t hold out hope. This vulnerability was originally posted 2019-01-27 and there have been 8 releases since then

  Hi all,

  We have determined that the conditions being reported do not constitute an exploit in the PayPal Checkout extension for WooCommerce. While it is true that the amount can be manipulated in the PayPal payment flow, this amount is validated against the WooCommerce order total before completing the order, and if it doesn’t match then the order will be left in an “On Hold” state. (In cases when the order is completed upon API payment request rather than IPN, the amount comes directly from the order, not a previous PayPal response.)

  If we were to receive exploit steps that result in a completed WooCommerce order with a lower payment amount (can be reported [here](https://hackerone.com/automattic)), we would act promptly to address the issue.

  Thank you,

  Paul
