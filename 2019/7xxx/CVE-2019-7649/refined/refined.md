The provided content discusses a specific issue reported on GitHub within the CmsWing project, titled "Encryption of password using MD5 and fixed salt". While the content doesn't explicitly mention a CVE, it details a vulnerability related to password encryption practices.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of MD5 hashing with a fixed salt for password encryption. Specifically, the `global.encryptPassword` function in `src/bootstrap/global.js` concatenates a fixed string ('www.cmswing.com'), the MD5 hash of the user-provided password (or directly the password if `md5encoded` is true), and another fixed string ('Arterli'), then hashes the result using MD5 again.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **MD5 Hash:** The use of MD5 is considered cryptographically broken. MD5 is susceptible to collision attacks which makes it unsuitable for password hashing.
- **Fixed Salt:** Using a fixed salt ('www.cmswing.com' and 'Arterli') across all users significantly weakens the hashing scheme. Because the salt is the same for every user, an attacker who compromises one user's password can easily reuse a pre-computed hash for all the users using the same password.
- **Double MD5:** While the application uses MD5 twice, it doesn't add much to security, especially due to the presence of fixed salts and general MD5 weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Password compromise:** An attacker could exploit the weakness in the password hashing algorithm to potentially retrieve user passwords.
- **Lateral movement:** In case an attacker finds one user's password, they could potentially use that knowledge to identify other users with the same password and gain access to other accounts
- **System-wide access:** If an administratorâ€™s password is compromised, they may gain system-wide access.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Rainbow table/pre-computed hash attacks:** An attacker can pre-compute MD5 hashes for a large number of passwords with the fixed salt and match those with the hashed passwords from the system.
- **Brute-force attacks:** Because the salt is fixed, brute-force becomes very effective, especially if a user has a common password.
- **Dictionary attacks:** An attacker can try common passwords along with the fixed salt to see if they can get a match.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to gain access to the stored password hashes. This would typically require a database breach or other form of data exfiltration.
- The attacker needs knowledge about the hashing algorithm used, including the fixed salts, which is available publicly in the code.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability provides more detail than a typical CVE description, which typically outlines the general weakness.
