Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7628:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the Pagure application sending API keys in plaintext via email when notifying users about upcoming key expirations. This occurred because the system was including the API key directly in the email content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Plaintext transmission of secrets:** The API keys were being sent in the body of emails, without any encryption or obfuscation.
- **Email security:** The vulnerability was further exacerbated by the fact that many email servers do not enforce TLS certificate validation, making these emails susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Partial fix was insufficient**: An earlier attempt to fix the issue only shortened the API key to the first 5 characters, which still weakens the secret by revealing part of it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account compromise:** Attackers intercepting these emails could gain access to the full or partial API keys and subsequently impersonate users to access Pagure's resources.
- **Unauthorized access:** With compromised API keys, attackers could perform actions on behalf of legitimate users within the Pagure system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** Attackers could intercept emails containing the API keys as they are transmitted between email servers, especially if TLS is not correctly enforced.
- **Email server compromise**: An attacker with access to email servers could also get access to the API keys sent via email

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network-level access:** Attackers needed to be positioned to intercept network traffic between email servers to conduct MITM attacks.
- **Compromised Email server:** Attackers with access to email servers can potentially access the emails and corresponding API keys.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `57975ef30641907947038b608017a9b721eb33fe` which was included in Pagure 5.2.
- A previous attempt to fix the issue by shortening the API key to the first 5 characters was made in commit `9905fb1e64341822366b6ab1d414d2baa230af0a`, but this still exposed part of the secret.
- The vulnerability was ultimately fixed by removing the API key from the email and using the API key description instead. This fix was implemented in commit `d18f42d021dd69161b46af71e6b89e71610494b0` included in Pull Request #4254.
- A workaround was proposed, which involved disabling the cron job that sent the reminder emails and deleting existing API keys.
