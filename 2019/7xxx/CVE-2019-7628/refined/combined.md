[commented 5 years ago](#comment-0 "Permalink to this headline")

It was discovered that Pagure was leaking API keys by e-mailing

them to users. Few e-mail servers validate TLS certificates, so

it is possible for man-in-the-middle attacks to read these e-mails

and gain access to Pagure on the behalf of other users. The

vulnerability was introduced in [0].

This problem was partially addressed in a prior commit[1], but

that commit still leaks the first 5 characters of the key which

weakens the secret.

This commit uses the description of the API key instead of any part

of the secret in the e-mail sent to users so that none of the key

is e-mailed over the Internet.

# Workaround

This issue can be worked around by disabling the cron job. After disabling the cron job, it would be wise to delete any API keys you think may have been e-mailed. You can delete them all to be safe. Users will have to generate new ones if you take this step.

The tests failed but because of repoSpanner which is broken for everyone.

I'll adjust the wording of the email sent a little bit as well but that can come in another PR

Thanks for the patch and for catching this and doing all the work to get the CVE number and all!

#### #4252 CVE-2019-7628: Pagure 5.2 leaks full API keys. Closed: Fixed 5 years ago by pingou. Opened 5 years ago by bowlofeggs.

Closed: Fixed
Reopen Issue

It was discovered that Pagure was leaking API keys by e-mailing

them to users. Few e-mail servers validate TLS certificates, so

it is possible for man-in-the-middle attacks to read these e-mails and

gain access to Pagure on the behalf of other users. The

vulnerability was introduced in [0], which was released with Pagure 5.2.

As of the time of this writing, there is not a released Pagure with a fix

for this issue.

#### #4230 API Key reminder sends the key in the clear via email Closed: Fixed 5 years ago by pingou. Opened 5 years ago by bcl.

Closed: Fixed
Reopen Issue

I received a reminder that an API key was due to expire. The email included the key in the clear. It shouldn't be sending keys via email, just the description and a link to the API page.

We should be able to fix this one easily by including only the first, say 5, characters of the API token.

Should be easy to fix :)

    Fix calculation of days until API key expires and short the API key in the emails

    API key reminder should not send the API key in clear text. Shorten displayed
    key to 5 chars.

    Calculation of remaining days until a API key expires was wrong as it took into
    account only the days part of the date and ignored month or year.

    fixes #4230
    fixes #4231
