Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-7393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of sufficient protection against UI redress attacks (also known as clickjacking).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the susceptibility to UI redress attacks. This implies that the application does not properly prevent its interface from being embedded within another web page, controlled by a malicious attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can allow a malicious actor to gain sensitive information. The specific nature of the sensitive information is not disclosed but is likely related to the application's functionality, possibly through tricking users to perform actions within the embedded frame they are not aware of.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a UI redress attack. This involves embedding the vulnerable application's interface within a malicious page, usually using an iframe. The attacker then overlays this embedded frame with a fake user interface, designed to trick users into clicking on desired elements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page and lure a user into visiting it. The attacker does not require prior access to the application to exploit this issue. The user needs to have a valid session with the vulnerable application.
