- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path traversal
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability that leads to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not provide specific attack vectors, but path traversal vulnerabilities generally involve manipulating file paths to access unauthorized locations or execute malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need the ability to somehow influence the file paths used by the application. The specific method of exploitation is not described in this document, but it could involve crafted input or malicious files.
