Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-7579:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of a publicly accessible JavaScript file (`setup.js.localized`) on the Linksys WRT1900ACS router's web server. This file contains a list of 30 words used as a base for generating default guest network passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable `.js` file can be accessed without any authentication.
*   **Predictable Passwords:** The guest network password generation scheme uses a list of 30 hardcoded words combined with a two-digit number.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Network Access:** An attacker can gain access to the guest Wi-Fi network by brute-forcing the password.
*   **Unfettered Internet Usage:** The attacker can use the compromised guest Wi-Fi for internet access without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range of the router's guest Wi-Fi network.
*   **Web Request:** The attacker retrieves the password base from the publicly accessible javascript file via HTTP request.
*    **Brute-Force Attack:** The attacker uses a dictionary attack, combining the known 30-word list with two-digit numbers, to guess the guest network password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to connect to the guest WiFi network (i.e. be within range of the Wi-Fi).
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate to access the javascript file.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to make HTTP requests.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to script and perform brute-force login attempts.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists on Linksys WRT1900ACS devices with firmware version 1.0.3.187766.
*   The provided content includes a Python proof-of-concept script for exploiting this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Aaron Weathersby (t0b0rx0r).
* The exploit uses a default guest login page, which might be disabled by a user.
*The author noted this was their second time submitting a CVE request for Linksys.
