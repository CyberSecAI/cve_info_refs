# My second CVE, LinkSys- WRT ACS- CVE-2019-7579 (or as i call it…acceptance…no one considers security by design)

June 9, 2019

So for my second time ever I’ve submitted another CVE request for yet another security flaw within the Linksys WRT 1300 ACS router.  Before i get into the technical details I will admit i’m a bit disappointed in Linksys …or belkin…or whomever.  My assumption was that my very expensive router would have security at heart in its design and to find a second flaw…and notably one that would allow someone to break into my network and get free WiFi access is a bit annoying.  Anyways….onto the breakdown.

**The Flaw**

An unauthenticated user can join to the guest WiFi network presented by the router and if the guest password has not been changed they can brute force passed the captive portal login using one of a handful default passwords that are combined with a 2 digit number.

![](https://cdn5.alienvault.com/blog-content/brute-force-apple-2.jpg)

The router seems to generally suffer from a series of issues related to unauthenticated access of its base lighttpd web server.  Specifically for this issue a .js file can be reached without authentication which seems to contain the scheme for which passwords are created on the guest network of the device.

As quoted in my official CVE publication…….

 ***“An issue was discovered on Linksys WRT1900ACS 1.0.3.187766 devices. An ability exists for an unauthenticated user to browse a confidential ui/1.0.99.187766/dynamic/js/setup.js.localized file on the router’s webserver, allowing for an attacker to identify possible passwords that the system uses to set the default guest network password. An attacker can use this list of 30 words along with a random 2 digit number to brute force their access onto a router’s guest network.”***

**BUG URL:** [http:/<guestwifiipofrouter>:10080/ui/1.0.99.187766/dynamic/js/setup.js.localized](http://192.168.3.1:10080/ui/1.0.99.187766/dynamic/js/setup.js.localized)

**Precanned password block**

“almond”,
“avocado”,
“basil”,

“blueberry”,

I guess someone at Linksys really likes fruit and veggies

I wrote a python proof of concept to automatically take this list of canned passwords and attempt to bruce for the login.

But in short it takes the above list of words and attempts to find a combination + a random 2 digit number(00-99) that provides a 200 OK response

I**mplications**

The implications for this flaw are mild. The LinkSys router makes use of an embedded linux distro combined with a software based router (zebra) and a few other tricks to isolate guest network onto its own vlan. This should provide some safety from a rouge hacker gaining access to this network. The biggest concern would be the unfettered use of your WiFi/Internet by someone who dont know and didn’t authorize to use your network.

**How Did I find It?**

By having too much time on my hands and scanning for accessible directories and files on the router prior to authentication (BURP, Dirbuster, GoBuster)

**The CVE Process**

* 2/1/19: Requested CVE
* 2/14/19 : Notified manufacturer of design flaw.
* 6/8/19: No Response- Published Flaw

On my way to studying from Offensive Security's OSCE exam I began to explore exploit-db.com for exploitable applications I could try to recreate. I found EasyFTP 1.0.7.11 and went about trying to own it. 1. Fuzzed using Boo-Fuzz that identified the LIST parameter as being exploitable. - I found a good Boo-Fuzz tutorial on youtube . - Note below, that i reviewed several different parameters including user, stor,retr, password and list.  Generally speaking you identify these parameters by reviewing the RFC associated with the application and reviewing a wireshark snippet while regularly interacting with the application.  (part of Boofuzz python script) (output of running BooFuzz python script) - You can see at 407 bytes the script fails to receive response from EasyFTP...i.e. it crashed .  At this point you'd want to confirm this crash by reviewing Immunity and confirm that you see the application crashed.  2. Replicated Boo-F...

So.....hell has frozen over and I've finally started a security blog.  My name Aaron aka T0b0rX0r and Robot Security is my home away from 127.0.0.1.  This blog was setup to host my tutorials, exploits, CTF walk throughs and generally my thoughts on security. I am technology professional based out of the Los Angeles region.  I've worked in information technology for 17 years and as of late been focusing on infosec.  I have a background that includes a bachlors in Computer Science from USC, a masters in technology as well as being certified as Offensive Security Certified Processional (OSCP), a Certified Information Security Professional(CISSP),  and a Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP). I'll be working to keep this site up to date with a new article once a week (atleast). I can be reached over twitter (@t0b0rx0r) and on linked-in.  I also host my code (generally exploits) on github  (http://www.github.com/t0b0rx0r) .
