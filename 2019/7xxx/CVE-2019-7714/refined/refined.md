Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Interpeak IPWEBS web server used in Green Hills Integrity RTOS 5.0.4. Specifically, a buffer overflow occurs when parsing HTTP authentication headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `t_webserver_basic_auth_check` function allocates a 60-byte buffer (`auth_outbuf`) to store and parse the HTTP authentication header. However, the code copies the header data into this buffer without checking the length of the incoming header (`auth_str`).
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `t_webserver_basic_auth_check` function does not validate the size of the input string before copying it into the fixed-size buffer, leading to a classic buffer overflow if the header is larger than 60 bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory locations on the stack, potentially including return addresses. This can lead to control flow hijacking, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the web server process, leading to complete compromise of the vulnerable device.
- **Denial of Service:** In less sophisticated attacks, the overflow can lead to the corruption of program data, which may cause the webserver process to crash and cause a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long `Authorization` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device running the vulnerable web server.
- **HTTP Request Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests, including the `Authorization` header, with a size greater than 60 bytes.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability in the `t_webserver_basic_auth_check` function.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerable function is `t_webserver_basic_auth_check`.
- A 60 byte buffer (`auth_outbuf`) is allocated on the stack.
- The input `auth_str` is copied to the buffer using `t_decode_base64_into`.
- There is no length check before the copy is performed.

The provided content includes a snippet of assembly code of the vulnerable function (`t_webserver_basic_auth_check`) which provides detailed information about how the overflow is achieved, by copying the decoded base64 string to the stack without any length checking.
