Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2019-7231:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The ABB IDAL FTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** Sending an FTP command string of 472 bytes or more overflows a buffer.
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The FTP server has default or hardcoded credentials ("exor/exor"), which allows unauthenticated attackers to gain access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow causes an exception that terminates the FTP server process. This makes the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted FTP commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system running the vulnerable FTP server.
- **Authentication (if not using default creds):** While the default credentials can be used, if those are changed, the attacker must be able to authenticate to the FTP server to trigger the buffer overflow using the crafted commands.
