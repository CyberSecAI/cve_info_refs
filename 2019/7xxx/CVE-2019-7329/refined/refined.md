The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7329.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the insecure use of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in the form action of multiple views within ZoneMinder. This allows arbitrary input appended to the webroot URL to be reflected back without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input sanitization/escaping of special characters in `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL, potentially leading to:
- Session hijacking
- Cookie theft
- Defacement of the web page
- Redirection to malicious sites
- Execution of arbitrary commands

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL containing an XSS payload.
- The attacker has to send this crafted URL to the victim and the victim needs to click it.
- The vulnerable page reflects the unsanitized input, executing the malicious script in the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with an XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click on the malicious link to trigger the XSS.
