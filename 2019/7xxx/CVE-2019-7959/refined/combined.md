### [Deliveroo watches you while you eat](https://davidjb.com/blog/2022/04/deliveroo-watches-you-while-you-eat/)

**tl;dr** Deliveroo sends your browser [movie titles with food puns](#movie-titles) as it tracks your activity.

---

The online food ordering platform [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.com.au), like many (most?) online
platforms, monitors you as you interact with their website. It’s not really a
secret that [behavioural analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_analytics) (or “big data analytics”) get gathered
from our time online, but is rather what we’ve come to expect of online
companies who seek to extract, leverage and monetise the data generated from
our interactions with their services.

It won’t surprise anyone to know that Amazon [actively uses](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/teams/customer-behavior-analytics) customer
behaviours in real-time to affect the …

### [﻿Updating the BIOS on a Supermicro Motherboard](https://davidjb.com/blog/2021/01/updating-the-bios-on-a-supermicro-motherboard/)

Supermicro provides BIOS upgrades for its motherboards and some particular
models’ upgrades require the use of a DOS-based environment to be applied. If
you’re reading this, you’ll already have noted that the README supplied with
the upgrade .zip file isn’t overly helpful on getting set up with a
suitable environment to *safely* run the BIOS upgrade. Likewise, if you’ve
tried to actually run the included FLASH.BAT file, you’ll probably have
found it doesn’t quite work. Hence, these instructions to guide you.

1. Before we get started, bear in mind that flashing your BIOS …

### [Travel Hack: Cheapest Australian Airport Transport Options](https://davidjb.com/blog/2018/12/travel-hack-cheapest-australian-airport-transport-options/)

Australia is an expensive place to travel - well, at least in terms of
services attached to *airports*. For some reason, Australia loves to jack up
the prices of everything at an airport like food, drinks and of course
*transport* when trying to get to the airport or escape it. Even though the
CBDs of our cities are fairly close to their respective airports (Melbourne is
one exception), the [privatisation](https://www.airportlink.com.au/company/)
of train links sees the costs stay high.

So how does one break the cycle of having to pay over AUD$18 to get from
somewhere like Brisbane Airport to the …

### [VDSL Modem in Bridge Mode: How does it work?](https://davidjb.com/blog/2018/09/vdsl-modem-in-bridge-mode-how-does-it-work/)

In networking terms, a *Bridge* is a way in which multiple networking
interfaces (physical or virtual) can be made to function as as if they were a
single network interface. In general terms, this is how clients associated
with a router on both wired Ethernet and wireless can communicate together.
In my specific case, I have a VDSL modem which is configured in *bridged mode*
and plugging into my Turris Omnia router to enable the Turris to connect to
the Internet.

With details scarce online about exactly *how* this black magic works to allow
my Ethernet-only router to connect to …

### [How to buy alcohol at Costco without a membership (in Hawaii)](https://davidjb.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-buy-alcohol-at-costco-without-a-membership-in-hawaii/)

There’s a variety of anecdotal information online about whether it’s possible
to purchase alcohol or liquor from membership-based stores (such as Costco) in
the United States if you don’t have a paid membership. Some sites quote
federal, state or local liquor licensing laws as to why it isn’t possible for
“alcohol clubs” to exist or similarly vague or unreferenced sources.

Having recently travelled to Hawaii, I wanted to test these ‘theories’ out for
myself and see whether I could get a good deal for something to take back home
as my duty-free allowance.

My research took …

### [Ordering a Turris Omnia in Australia (2018 pricing)](https://davidjb.com/blog/2018/01/ordering-a-turris-omnia-in-australia-2018-pricing/)

The [Turris Omnia](https://omnia.turris.cz/) is an amazing home router. Not
only did it start from humble beginnings from a crowd-funding campaign but
it’s open source, has a huge community and supported by CZ.nic, the
association responsible for domain names the Czech Republic.

I won’t wax lyrical about the benefits of the device as you can discover that
for yourself, but rather I’ll tell you how you can order one of these if you
happen to live in a country where the the resellers don’t ship to. The
devices are sold through Amazon.de and various [other …](https://omnia.turris.cz/en/#buy)

### [Can’t change Apple ID email address? Try waiting 30 days](https://davidjb.com/blog/2018/01/cant-change-apple-id-email-address-try-waiting-30-days/)

Like it or not, Apple plays a critical part in the app-based economy these
days. Part of this is having an Apple Developer account in order to release
apps to the App Store™️, and in order to get an Apple Developer account you
need an Apple ID. In order for the Apple ID to be able to become an Apple
Developer account, it needs to be considered to be “over 18”, even if it’s a
company account and a Date of Birth makes no sense whatsoever. This is where
I got stuck.

Let’s say you don’t realise …

### [Resolving an NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_CORRUPTED error in Mozilla Firefox](https://davidjb.com/blog/2017/11/resolving-an-ns_error_file_corrupted-error-in-mozilla-firefox/)

I use Mozilla Firefox as my browser and occasionally I’ve found that certain
resources (typically JavaScript or CSS files) may fail to load because of an
error NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_CORRUPTED, which is displayed in the console. For me,
this is rarely seen, though I’ve experienced the issue a few times on
Trello.com and another on our corporate website CMS. This has the effect of
preventing whatever that resource was from loading, so in the case of CSS it
won’t display and in the case of JS it won’t run. On Trello, this resulted in
a fully broken …

### [iMessage and Google Talk not working on macOS High Sierra (10.13)](https://davidjb.com/blog/2017/10/imessage-and-google-talk-not-working-on-macos-high-sierra-1013/)

I recently upgraded my computer to macOS 10.13 and found that my iMessage (in
Messages.app) wasn’t working entirely and that Google Talk in the same app
would only receive messages and not send.

Starting with the Google Talk issue, that’s an easy one. Apple has removed
“official” support for Google Talk from Messages.app but they’ve clearly left
the code in place that allows your old account to login, connect and actually
receive messages, but helpfully added a dialog that says “Your message could
not be sent. Support for the targeted service Google Talk has …

### [Static sites, continuous deployment and HTTPS with Netlify](https://davidjb.com/blog/2016/12/static-sites-continuous-deployment-and-https-with-netlify/)

I’ve been doing a variety of things pertaining to web security in recent weeks
and one thing that’s been gnawing at my brain is the fact that my blog could
*still* only use insecure http:// because of GitHub Pages. My blog’s
content was using GitHub Pages for its serving and gh-pages really hasn’t
been seeing a lot of love - that I know of - since its inception a few years
back, especially since the development of concepts like Let’s Encrypt with
free SSL certs for the web.

I felt I probably should have taken a more …
