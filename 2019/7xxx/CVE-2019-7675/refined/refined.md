**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cleartext transmission of credentials due to the use of HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- Use of Basic Authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Credentials can be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attacker monitoring network traffic.
- This would allow unauthorized access to the camera's management interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network traffic interception between the client and the camera.
- Man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the MOBOTIX camera.
- Network access to the device.
