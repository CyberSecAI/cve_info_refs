Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-7839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of JNBridge technology within Adobe ColdFusion. JNBridge allows the integration of Java and .NET application code. The JNBridge protocol directly exposes operations that allow for arbitrary Java code execution, including the ability to create Java objects, call methods, get/set object fields, and call static methods. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the JNBridge listener is publicly exposed on TCP ports 6093 or 6095 without proper authentication or access controls, allowing an attacker to interact with it remotely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Access to Java Runtime Environment:** The JNBridge protocol provides direct access to fundamental Java operations, enabling the execution of arbitrary Java code and system commands.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The JNBridge listener does not implement any authentication mechanism to verify the identity of the connecting client.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The JNBridge service runs with high privileges (SYSTEM), which further enables the attacker to execute system level commands if the connection is established.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary Java code on the server.
*   **Command Execution:** Through the Java runtime environment, an attacker can execute system commands with the privileges of the ColdFusion service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attacker sends specially crafted requests to the publicly accessible JNBridge listener on TCP ports 6093 or 6095.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the exposed JNBridge listener on the target server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory specifically mentions that this vulnerability does not affect ColdFusion 11. It impacts versions 2018 and 2016.
*   The advisory highlights that the JNBridge technology should not be used across privilege boundaries.
*   The provided Proof of Concept shows how an attacker can use the exposed protocol to execute commands, including whoami, to gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges.
*   The suggested solution includes applying the latest ColdFusion security patches and not exposing JNBridge listeners to untrusted parties, which indicates that the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by anyone that can reach the mentioned ports.
