Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `frame.php` view in ZoneMinder insecurely printing the `show` parameter's value onto the webpage without proper sanitization or escaping of special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`show` parameter) before rendering it in the HTML context, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
- This could lead to a variety of malicious activities including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Potentially gaining access to sensitive information or the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes a malicious script in the `show` parameter.
- The vulnerable URL is: `http://localhost/zm/index.php?view=frame&eid=2&fid=99&scale=test&show=<script>alert('1');</script>` or `http://localhost/zm/index.php?view=frame&eid=2&fid=99&scale=test&show="><img src=x onerror=prompt('1');>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with an XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to lure a user into clicking the malicious link or otherwise have the user access the malicious link in their browser.
- The user needs to be logged into the vulnerable ZoneMinder instance to make this vulnerability exploitable.

**Additional Details:**
- The report specifies the vulnerable ZoneMinder version: `v1.33.1`
- The payload `"><img src=x onerror=prompt('1');>` is also mentioned.
