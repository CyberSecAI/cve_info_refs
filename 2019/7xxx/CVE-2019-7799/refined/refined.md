Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of PostScript files. Specifically, the lack of proper checks leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can disclose sensitive information by reading data outside of the allocated buffer.
- The vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current user process, though this CVE itself only allows information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PostScript file.
- The target user must interact with the malicious file, such as opening it in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious PostScript file.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to open the malicious PostScript file in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- No special privileges or network access are needed; the attacker can be local to the machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is classified as "Important" by Adobe.
- The CVSS score is 3.3, indicating a low-severity vulnerability, specifically because the vulnerability only allows for information disclosure without code execution. However, other sources describe this as a starting point for further exploitation with other vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Source Incite via the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
