  "CVE-2019-7635": {
    "description": "SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) through 1.2.15 and 2.x through 2.0.9 has a heap-based buffer over-read in Blit1to4 in video/SDL_blit_1.c.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `Blit1to4` function within `SDL_blit_1.c`. It arises due to a heap-based buffer over-read when processing certain BMP images with indexed color palettes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer over-read"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by enticing a user to process a specially crafted BMP image.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "Maliciously crafted BMP image",
          "Network (if user accesses malicious content remotely)",
           "Local (if the malicious file is local to the user)"
        ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted BMP image. No user privileges are required, but user interaction to process the image is necessary."
