Why NetFlow Analyzer?

NetFlow Analyzer, a complete [traffic analytics tool](https://www.manageengine.com/products/netflow/network-traffic-analysis.html?nfa-index-whynfa "Traffic Analytics Tool"), that leverages [flow technologies](https://www.manageengine.com/products/netflow/what-is-netflow.html?nfa-index-whynfa "NetFlow") to provide real time visibility into the network bandwidth performance. NetFlow Analyzer, primarily a bandwidth monitoring tool, has been optimizing thousands of networks across the World by giving holistic view about their network bandwidth and traffic patterns. NetFlow Analyzer is a unified [network traffic monitor](https://www.manageengine.com/products/netflow/network-traffic-monitor.html?nfa-index-whynfa) that collects, analyzes and reports about what your network bandwidth is being used for and by [whom](https://www.manageengine.com/products/netflow/Department-wise-bandwidth-monitoring-using-netflow-analyzer.html?nfa-index-whynfa "IP groups"). NetFlow Analyzer is the trusted partner optimizing the bandwidth usage of over a million interfaces worldwide apart from performing [network forensics](https://www.manageengine.com/products/netflow/network-forensics.html?index), network traffic analysis and network flow monitoring.
