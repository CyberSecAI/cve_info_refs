CVE-2019-7722:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: XML parsing wasn't hardened, allowing for XXE attacks due to default Java parser settings.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
  - Impact of exploitation: Information disclosure on the developer's machine, CI servers, or other infrastructure running PMD, as well as denial of service attacks and request forgery.
  - Attack vectors: Rulesets can be either local files or accessed through the network over HTTP/HTTPS. Depending on the context, this attack could require physical access to the machine or be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Could require physical access or man-in-the-middle attack depending on ruleset location.
  - Affected versions: All PMD versions up to PMD 6.0.0 are vulnerable.
