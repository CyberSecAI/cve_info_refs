Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7809

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Use-After-Free issue within the parsing of field elements in AcroForms. The root cause is a lack of proper validation of the existence of an object before operations are performed on that object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Use-After-Free

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the Use-After-Free vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. According to ZDI, this vulnerability specifically leads to information disclosure. However, the Adobe advisory indicates that use-after-free vulnerabilities in general can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user, and also states this specific vulnerability is critical

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to induce a user to open a malicious PDF file.
*   Alternatively, an attacker could host a malicious page which, if visited, could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious PDF file that exploits the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the file to a user or host a malicious page.
* User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability resides within the parsing of field elements in AcroForms.
*   The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.
*   An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and macOS.
*  The advisory mentions that Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned ZDI-19-500 and ZDI-CAN-8180 to this CVE.
