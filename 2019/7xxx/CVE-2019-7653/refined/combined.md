Subject: python-rdflib-tools: Code injection from current working directory
Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2019 21:49:07 +0100
```
Package: python-rdflib-tools
Version: 4.2.2-1
Severity: normal
Tags: security

The CLI tools in python-rdflib-tools can from load python modules
found in the current directory. This happens because "python -m"
appends the current directory in the python path.

    $ echo 'print("Something")' > cgi.py
    $ rdf2dot
    INFO:rdflib:RDFLib Version: 4.2.2
    Something
    Reading from stdin as None...

The local cgi.py file is loaded instead of the system one.

There are probably other instances of this in the Debian
archive. Constructs such as:

  python -m "$some_module"
  python -c "$some_code"
  $some_command | python

can lead to code injection from current working directory

MITRE has assigned [CVE-2019-7653](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-7653) for this issue.

For those following the bug, this likely does not affect the upstream
project itself and is Debian specifc, as the Debian packaging AFAICS
replaces the respective scripts/tools by wrappers invoking python -m
as described by Gabriel (please correct me if I'm wrong).

Regards,
Salvatore

I've updated the package's source to avoid the issue by using the
wrappers that setup.py/easy_install provides rather than making our own
in Debian.

I can't directly push to the source right now (but have a PR pending at
[1]) and can't upload (as I don't have DMUA on that package).

Andreas or Ondřej, could you do pull that in and do a team upload on
this? (I can prepare a full DM upload to be sponsered, but it's my
impression that team uploads are the easier way to go about this now).

Best regards
Christian

Hmmm, I can not merge either.  What about moving that repository to
Debian Python Modules team?

I prefer to sponsor right from the Git repository but a repository where
neither the Maintainer nor its sponsor can write to is just insane and
DPMT seems the natural team that package belongs to.

Thanks for your work on this package anyway

      Andreas.

That's odd given you created the repo – but yes, I'm fine with it being
in DPMT as well, and will request it transferred (that'll only work via
the alioth admins).

I used to be member of the DPMT group back on Alioth[2], can you add me on
salsa? Then I can make the package ready for sponsor-upload-from-git
once moved.

Thanks
Christian

Yes, that's really odd.  I tried via Salsa web interface which does not
enable the "Merge" button.  When trying to do it manually the last step
fails:

  $ git push origin debian
GitLab: You are not allowed to push code to this project.
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

What is also strange: If I go to the original location on Salsa web
interface I see a hint:

  Project 'debian/rdflib' was moved to 'python-team/rdflib'. Please update any links and bookmarks that may still have the old path.

So it was somehow moved but definitely to a wrong location (that should
be rather python-team/modules/rdflib).

Sorry, I can't for DPMT but I think Ondřej (re-added to CC) can.

Kind regards

      Andreas.

yes, that was a mistake when moving the module and is now fixed.

I've incorporated the changes from the move and an update to
standards-version, and set the changelog to indicate release readiness.
Would you sponsor the latest version (81346975) of [1] to close this
issue?

Thanks

| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The Debian python-rdflib-tools 4.2.2-1 package for RDFLib 4.2.2 has CLI tools that can load Python modules from the current working directory, allowing code injection, because "python -m" looks in this directory, as demonstrated by rdf2dot. This issue is specific to use of the debian/scripts directory. |

## Packages

* [rdflib](/security/cves?package=rdflib) - Pure Python package for working with RDF

## Details

Gabriel Corona discovered that RDFLib did not properly load modules on the

command-line. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause RDFLib to

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-7653](/security/CVE-2019-7653))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [python-rdflib](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/rdflib)
  -
  [4.1.2-3+deb8u1build0.16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/rdflib/4.1.2-3%2Bdeb8u1build0.16.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that

make use of RDFLib to make all the necessary changes.

Package        : rdflib
Version        : 4.1.2-3+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-7653
Debian Bug     : #921751

The CLI tools in python-rdflib-tools can load python modules
found in the current directory. This happens because "python -m"
appends the current directory in the python path.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
4.1.2-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rdflib packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2861-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                          Adrian Bunk

Package        : rdflib
Version        : 4.2.1-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-7653
Debian Bug     : 921751

The python-rdflib-tools package (tools for converting to and from RDF)
had wrappers that could load Python modules from the current working
directory, allowing code injection.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
4.2.1-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rdflib packages.

For the detailed security status of rdflib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rdflib>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
