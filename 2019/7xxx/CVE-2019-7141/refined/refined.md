Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PostScript files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, it stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which leads to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from memory due to the out-of-bounds read.
- Possible code execution: The advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious page: An attacker could host a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when visited by a user.
- Malicious file: An attacker could create a malicious PostScript file that triggers the vulnerability when opened by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to deliver a malicious PostScript file or induce a user to visit a malicious webpage.
- User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The target user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
