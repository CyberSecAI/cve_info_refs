```
Several issues in elfutils, a collection of utilities to handle ELF
objects, have been found either by fuzzing or by using an
AddressSanitizer.
```

CVE-2019-7665
     Due to a heap-buffer-overflow problem in function elf32_xlatetom()
     a crafted ELF input can cause segmentation faults.

CVE-2019-7150
     Add sanity check for partial core file dynamic data read.

CVE-2019-7149
     Due to a heap-buffer-overflow problem in function read_srclines()
     a crafted ELF input can cause segmentation faults.

CVE-2018-18521
     By using a crafted ELF file, containing a zero sh_entsize, a
     divide-by-zero vulnerability could allow remote attackers to
     cause a denial of service (application crash).

CVE-2018-18520
     By fuzzing an Invalid Address Deference problem in function elf_end
     has been found.

CVE-2018-18310
     By fuzzing an Invalid Address Read problem in eu-stack has been
     found.

CVE-2018-16062
     By using an AddressSanitizer a heap-buffer-overflow has been found.

CVE-2017-7613
     By using fuzzing it was found that an allocation failure was not
     handled properly.

Replicated using valgrind on the reproducers.  We would assume the dir and file tables were properly terminated by a NUL byte. But if that wasn't actually there we could read one byte past the end of the data buffer. A similar issue was in readelf.c (although it is harder to trigger since readlelf has more sanity checks before it can get to this point).

For DWARF version < 5 the .debug_line directory and file tables consist     of a terminating NUL byte after all strings. The code used to just skip     this without checking it actually existed.

# USN-4012-1: elfutils vulnerabilities

10 June 2019

Several security issues were fixed in elfutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [elfutils](/security/cves?package=elfutils) - collection of utilities to handle ELF objects

## Details

It was discovered that elfutils incorrectly handled certain malformed

files. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted file, elfutils could be made to crash or consume

resources, resulting in a denial of service.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1671446#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-01-31 15:40:27 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in elfutils 0.175. A segmentation fault can occur in the function elf64_xlatetom in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c, due to dwfl_segment_report_module not checking whether the dyn data read from a core file is truncated. A crafted input can cause a program crash, leading to denial-of-service, as demonstrated by eu-stack.   References: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24103> <https://sourceware.org/ml/elfutils-devel/2019-q1/msg00070.html>  Upstream Patch: <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=elfutils.git;a=commit;h=da5c5336a1eaf519de246f7d9f0f5585e1d4ac59>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1671446#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-02-22 15:43:46 UTC  ``` Created elfutils tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1680044](show_bug.cgi?id=1680044 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-7150 elfutils: segmentation fault in elf64_xlatetom in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1671446#c4)  Mark Wielaard    2019-02-22 23:05:00 UTC  ``` The title and description are slightly unfortunate since the issue doesn't have anything to do with the elf64_xlatetom function. That function just happens to be the function that accesses some undefined memory (indirectly through a memmove call).  A better description would be "eu-stack can crash when reading a corrupt or partial core file".   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1671446#c5)  Dave Baker    2019-03-06 16:05:08 UTC  ``` Flagging openshift-online-3 as NOTAFFECTED since binaries ship as part of RHEL.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1671446#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:27:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2197 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2197](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2197)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1671446#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-06 13:21:40 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-7150>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1671446#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 21:13:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3575 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3575](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3575)   ``` |  |

# [PATCH] libdw: Check terminating NUL byte in dwarf\_getsrclines for dir/file table.

* *From*: Mark Wielaard <mark at klomp dot org>
* *To*: elfutils-devel at sourceware dot org
* *Cc*: Mark Wielaard <mark at klomp dot org>
* *Date*: Sun, 20 Jan 2019 22:16:03 +0100
* *Subject*: [PATCH] libdw: Check terminating NUL byte in dwarf\_getsrclines for dir/file table.

---

```
For DWARF version < 5 the .debug_line directory and file tables consist
of a terminating NUL byte after all strings. The code used to just skip
this without checking it actually existed. This could case a spurious
read past the end of data.

Fix the same issue in readelf.
