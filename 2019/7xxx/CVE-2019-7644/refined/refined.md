Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-7644:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT` NuGet package, in versions prior to 1.0.4, included the expected JWT signature in the error message when JWT signature validation failed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The library exposed the expected JWT signature in error messages.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By obtaining the valid signature, attackers could forge JWT tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could forge valid JWT tokens to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker would need access to the application's error messages. This could be through the user interface, application logs, or diagnostic messages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger a JWT validation failure (e.g., by providing an invalid token) and observe the resulting error message containing the expected signature.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft their own JWT with the disclosed signature.
