Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-7611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper permission issue in Elasticsearch when Field Level Security (FLS) and Document Level Security (DLS) are disabled. Specifically, when `xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled` is set to `false` in `elasticsearch.yml`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insufficient permission checks when using the `_aliases`, `_shrink`, or `_split` endpoints to create new aliases or indices based on existing ones.
-  Bypass of intended access controls due to the disabled FLS and DLS settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain unauthorized access to data in a restricted index by creating an alias or new index that bypasses permission checks. This results in privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker must have the ability to use the `_aliases`, `_shrink`, or `_split` endpoints.
-  The attacker needs to have access to the Elasticsearch API.
-  The `xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled` setting in `elasticsearch.yml` must be set to `false`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have some level of access to the Elasticsearch API.
- The attacker doesn't need high-level access to exploit this vulnerability. The permission checks are skipped due to the specific configuration `xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled` set to `false`, not because of a lack of general authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Elasticsearch versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1.
- The recommended fix is to upgrade to Elasticsearch version 5.6.15 or 6.6.1 or set `xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled` to `true`.
- The default setting for `xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled` is `true`.
