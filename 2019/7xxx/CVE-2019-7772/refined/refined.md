The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7772.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-After-Free

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A Use-After-Free vulnerability exists within Adobe Acrobat and Reader. This vulnerability arises from improper memory management, specifically when an object is freed but still referenced later.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the user's machine by executing malicious code with the privileges of the logged-in user.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the use-after-free condition when processed by vulnerable versions of Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF document and convince a user to open it with the vulnerable software. No special network access or privileged position is explicitly mentioned.
