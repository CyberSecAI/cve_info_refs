The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7347.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The system checks if a user is authenticated, but the user can be deleted from the database before the system actually uses that authentication status for subsequent operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- TOCTOU race condition: The system checks user authentication status at one point and uses it later, creating a window where the authentication status can change.
- Session persistence after user deletion: The user's session remains active even after the user is deleted from the database.
- Lack of proper session invalidation: The system doesn't invalidate a user's session upon deletion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: A deleted user can still access the system interface.
- Data modification: A deleted user can make unauthorized modifications to application data (add/delete monitors, users, etc).
- Privilege escalation: A non-existing user could continue to act with their original privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- User deletion followed by continued session use.
- A deleted user navigating to the application through an active session

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with an active session, and able to create and delete a user.
