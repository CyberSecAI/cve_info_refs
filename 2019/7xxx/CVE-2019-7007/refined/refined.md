- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A file directory traversal vulnerability exists in Avaya EquinoxÂ® Conferencing Management (iView).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse the file system to access files or directories outside of the restricted directory. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability, where the application does not properly sanitize user-provided input that is used to construct file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories. This could lead to the disclosure of confidential information or potentially allow for further malicious actions if executable files are accessed. The impact is primarily focused on confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network (AV:N) and does not require any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N), indicating a remote attack is possible without any prior authentication or action by another user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected Avaya Equinox Conferencing Management application. No special privileges or user interaction are required.
