- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of deserialized data, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via the deserialization of untrusted data. The specific attack vector is not specified in the document, further details might be available in the respective Tech Notes for each ColdFusion version
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted data that will be deserialized by the vulnerable server.
