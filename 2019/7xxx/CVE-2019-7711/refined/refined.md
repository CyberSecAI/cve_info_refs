Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2019-7711:

**CVE-2019-7711: Interpeak IPCOMShell Undocumented Prompt Command Format String Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of the user-controlled input provided to the "prompt" command as a format string in a `printf` function call within the Interpeak IPCOMShell. The "prompt" command is not documented within the shell's help information.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Format String Vulnerability:** The program is using user-controlled data directly as a format string in `printf`, which allows the attacker to control the format specifiers.
    *   **Undocumented Command:** The "prompt" command is not documented, which might make it less obvious to users that this is a potential attack vector.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Leak:** The primary impact is an information leak. An attacker can use format string specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%s`, `%p`) to read arbitrary memory locations, potentially exposing sensitive information such as stack data, heap data, or addresses of functions or data structures.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Shell Access:** An attacker needs to have access to the Interpeak IPCOMShell to input the "prompt" command.
    *   **Command Injection:** The attacker injects format string specifiers as part of the new prompt.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have access to the shell of the affected system.
    *   The attacker needs to know the command "prompt" which is not documented.

**Summary of all CVEs mentioned:**

The provided content also mentions other vulnerabilities in the same product:

*   **CVE-2019-7714:** Stack Overflow in IPWEBS during HTTP authentication header parsing.
*   **CVE-2019-7712:** Format String Vulnerability in IPCOMShell PWD command handler.
