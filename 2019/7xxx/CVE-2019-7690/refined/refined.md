{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "MobaXterm stores the SSH private key (password protected) and its password in the process memory after a user logs into a remote server using passwordless SSH authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Sensitive information stored in memory",
      "Lack of proper memory management for sensitive data"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can dump or steal the SSH private key and its password as long as the MobaXterm process is running, even after the user disconnects from the remote server. This allows the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the remote server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Memory dumping",
       "Process inspection"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to attach to the running MobaXterm process.",
       "Ability to read process memory"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The provided exploit code uses Frida to attach to the MobaXterm process, scan the memory for specific patterns (SSH private key and password), and then dump the found memory regions."
