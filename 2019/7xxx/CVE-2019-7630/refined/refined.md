Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7630:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient filtering of Model Specific Register (MSR) writes within the `gdrv.sys` driver. The driver exposes a `wrmsr` instruction via IOCTL `0xC3502580` without properly validating the target MSR, allowing an attacker to write to arbitrary MSRs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted MSR Write:** The core vulnerability lies in the driver's ability to write to MSRs without proper validation.
- **IOCTL Exposure:** The vulnerable functionality is exposed via a specific IOCTL, `0xC3502580`, making it accessible to user-mode applications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Ring-0 code execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite the system call handler through MSR writes and achieve arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
- **Escalation of privileges:** Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation, allowing a local attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:**  A local attacker, with access to the system, can interact with the driver via the vulnerable IOCTL.
- **User-Mode access:** The IOCTL interface allows user-mode applications to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to interact with the vulnerable driver:** The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL commands to the `gdrv.sys` driver, which is loaded by vulnerable Gigabyte applications.
- **Initial Access:**  Requires local access to the system, meaning they need to have a foothold already on the target machine.
- **Elevated Privileges (in some cases):** While older versions may not require elevated privileges, newer versions of the vulnerable software or driver may need admin privileges for the IOCTL calls to succeed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable `gdrv.sys` driver was included with multiple Gigabyte applications, including APP Center, AORUS GRAPHICS ENGINE, XTREME GAMING ENGINE, and OC GURU II.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `gdrv.sys` version 19.0227.1, released in May 2019.
- Specific MSRs mentioned, that can be exploited, are: `0xC0000081`, `0xC0000082`, `0xC0000083`, `0x174`, `0x175`, and `0x176`.
- The exploit is achieved by overwriting the system call handler through the uncontrolled MSR writes.
