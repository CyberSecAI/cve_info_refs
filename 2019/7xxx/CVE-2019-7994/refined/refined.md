- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** The document doesn't specify the attack vector. However, the context suggests that it involves processing a malicious file that triggers the out-of-bounds write during parsing or processing within Photoshop.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious file or data that, when processed by the vulnerable Photoshop version, will trigger the out-of-bounds write vulnerability. The attacker would need to trick the user into opening such a malicious file using a vulnerable version of Photoshop.
