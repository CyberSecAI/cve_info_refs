Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling PostScript files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC's Distiller component. This improper validation can lead to a type confusion condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Type Confusion: The core vulnerability is a type confusion issue arising from the inadequate validation of user-supplied data in PostScript files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the vulnerable application. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PostScript File: The primary attack vector is a malicious PostScript file.
- User Interaction Required: User interaction is a prerequisite for exploitation. The target must open a malicious file or visit a page containing a malicious PostScript file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Attacker: The attacker can be remote, indicating that physical access to the target system is not required.
- Ability to craft malicious PostScript files and deliver it to target user.
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to open a crafted file.
