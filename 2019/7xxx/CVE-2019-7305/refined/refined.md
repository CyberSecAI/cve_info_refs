The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7305.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A patch file in the Ubuntu "extplorer" package creates a symbolic link within the application directory pointing to the system's `/usr/` directory. This makes the entire `/usr/` directory accessible over HTTP. Additionally, the package is missing a `.htaccess` file that would prevent access to files in `/etc/extplorer/` over HTTP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  Exposing the `/usr/` directory over HTTP due to a symbolic link.
2.  Missing `.htaccess` file in `/etc/extplorer/` directory, making files in this directory accessible over HTTP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access and read files in `/usr/` and `/etc/extplorer/`, leading to the leakage of sensitive system information, installed software details, and potentially configuration files.
2.  **Potential Remote Code Execution:** If executable files are present in the exposed directories, attackers may be able to execute them, potentially leading to arbitrary remote code execution.
3.  **System Reconnaissance:** Attackers can use the exposed information to learn about the system, which can be utilized to perform further exploitation of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  By accessing the exposed `/usr/` directory through the web server using the URL `http://<host>/extplorer/usr/`.
2.  By accessing files within the `/etc/extplorer/` directory through the web server using the URL `http://<host>/extplorer/config/<filename>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
2.  No authentication is needed to access the vulnerable directories over HTTP.
3.  The web server should be configured to follow symbolic links (which is enabled by default in Apache 2.4).
