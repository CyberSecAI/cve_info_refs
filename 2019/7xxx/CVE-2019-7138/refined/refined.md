Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7138

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing MOV files within Adobe Bridge CC. Specifically, it involves an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-Bounds Read: The application reads data beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information due to the out-of-bounds read. This vulnerability alone does not lead to code execution, but can be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: An attacker can craft a malicious MOV file.
- Malicious Page: An attacker could host a malicious page that triggers the vulnerability when accessed by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: The attacker requires the victim to open a malicious MOV file or visit a malicious page.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Adobe Bridge CC version 9.0.2 on Windows and macOS.
- Adobe released an update (version 9.0.3) to address this issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by Francis Provencher working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSS score is 5.5, with vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N indicating a local attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, user interaction is required, no change to scope, high confidentiality impact, no integrity impact, and no availability impact.
