Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-7803:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JPEG images within PostScript files by Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
- The core issue is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during JPEG parsing.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds read: Due to insufficient input validation, the application attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer for processing the JPEG image. This leads to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The out-of-bounds read can expose sensitive information from the application's memory. This information could be valuable for an attacker in subsequent attacks or may lead to a more impactful exploit when combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious File: An attacker can craft a malicious PostScript file containing a specially crafted JPEG image to trigger the vulnerability.
- Malicious Page: The target could also be lured to visit a malicious web page that attempts to trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: The victim must open the malicious PostScript file or visit the malicious page for the vulnerability to be triggered.
- No elevated privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Important" severity by Adobe.
- This vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to potentially gain code execution within the context of the current process.
