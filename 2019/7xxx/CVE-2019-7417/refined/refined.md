The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7417.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the Ericsson Active Library Explorer Server Version 14.3. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in multiple parameters of the "/cgi-bin/alexserv" servlet.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present. The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser when they access a malicious crafted URL. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
* Session hijacking
* Defacement of the web page
* Redirecting users to malicious websites
* Stealing user credentials or other sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs containing XSS payloads within the following parameters of the "/cgi-bin/alexserv" servlet:
* `DB`
* `FN`
* `fn`
* `id`
* `ID`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with XSS payloads in the aforementioned parameters. The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link. This could be done through:
* Phishing attacks
* Social engineering
* Inserting malicious links on a website visited by users of the vulnerable application

The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the application.
