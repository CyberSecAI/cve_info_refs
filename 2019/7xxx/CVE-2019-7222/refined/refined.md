Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-7222:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handles page fault exceptions during the emulation of certain instructions like `VMXON`, `VMCLEAR`, `VMPTRLD`, and `VMWRITE` when a memory address is used as an operand.
*   Specifically, if the operand points to an MMIO (Memory-Mapped I/O) address, the returned exception object contains uninitialized stack memory contents.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability leads to the leakage of uninitialized stack memory from the host to the guest.
*   **Use of Uninitialized Memory:** The returned exception object contains uninitialized data from the kernel stack, which is then accessible to the guest.
*   **Improper Page Fault Handling:** The KVM hypervisor does not correctly abort the VM with a `KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR` when a page fault occurs with an MMIO address, allowing the leak to happen.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   A malicious guest user/process can leverage this vulnerability to read sensitive data from the host's kernel stack memory.
*   This could lead to further exploitation or compromise of the host system by gaining unauthorized information.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Guest Access:** A malicious guest VM user or process has the potential to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Specific Instructions:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific instructions (`VMXON`, `VMCLEAR`, `VMPTRLD`, `VMWRITE`, `INVEPT`, `INVVPID`) when used with an MMIO address as operand.
*   **Nested Virtualization:** The issue is primarily seen with nested virtualization enabled on Intel processors.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a guest VM.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the parameters of instructions like  `VMXON`, `VMCLEAR`, `VMPTRLD`, `VMWRITE`, `INVEPT`, and `INVVPID` or trigger a page fault using such instructions and memory addresses.
* Nested virtualization support on Intel processors is needed for exploitation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to 4.20.8.
*   A fix for the issue has been implemented in the Linux Kernel by zeroing out the error code and CR2 values in the exception object, preventing the leak.
*   The vulnerability does not affect versions of the kernel package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is impacted when the nested virtualization feature is enabled.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is affected.
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise products, SUSE Liberty Linux, and openSUSE are impacted and have issued fixes.
*   Ubuntu is impacted and has issued updates to address this vulnerability.
