- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `download.php` view in ZoneMinder does not properly filter or escape the `exportFile` parameter value before printing it on the webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted URL where the `exportFile` parameter contains the malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it.
