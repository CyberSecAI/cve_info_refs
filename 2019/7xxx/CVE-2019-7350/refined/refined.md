The provided content is related to the CVE-2019-7350.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper implementation of session management, specifically the use of multiple cookies being set upon successful user login, and the re-use of the last user's last cookie as the next user's first cookie. This leads to session fixation issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper session management
- Session fixation vulnerability
- Multiple cookies being set upon login
- Re-use of the last user's cookie for the next user
- Insufficient cookie handling and invalidation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking, where an attacker can use another user's session cookie to gain access to their account.
- Potential for unauthorized access to the system by using a known, previously valid session cookie.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user logs into the application and captures their cookies.
- Another user logs into the same application using the same browser.
- The malicious user then uses the captured session cookie to hijack the victim's session, either locally or remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log into the application
- The attacker needs to capture the cookies being set by the application upon their successful login.
- The attacker needs to have a means of reusing the captured cookie on a different user's session.
- No special privileges needed, just a valid account and the ability to interact with the application.
