Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7594:

**CVE-2019-7594**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded RC2 cryptographic key within Johnson Controls' Metasys ADS/ADX servers and NAE/NIE/NCE engines. This key is used for certain encryption operations related to the Site Management Portal (SMP).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)**: The primary weakness is the presence of a static, hardcoded RC2 key within the system. This makes the system vulnerable to decryption attacks if the key is compromised.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An attacker who gains access to the hardcoded RC2 key can decrypt network traffic between the Metasys servers (ADS/ADX) or engines (NAE/NIE/NCE) and the connecting SMP user client. This could expose sensitive data transmitted over the network.
    *   Compromise of integrity and confidentiality as the attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access and control over the building automation system
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Network Traffic Capture:** An attacker would likely need to capture network traffic between the Metasys system and the SMP client.
    *   **Key Discovery:** The attacker needs to discover the hardcoded RC2 key. This could be achieved through various means like reverse engineering the software or potentially through other vulnerabilities if they exist
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Network Access**: The attacker needs to have a position allowing them to capture network traffic between the Metasys system components and the SMP user client.
    *   **Technical Skill**: Exploitation requires a high level of technical skill, indicating the need to analyze network protocols and possibly reverse engineer software components to extract the hardcoded key.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Metasys system versions prior to 9.0
*  **CVSS Score:** A CVSS v3 base score of 6.8 with the vector string (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N) is assigned to this vulnerability. This indicates that the vulnerability is network-based, has a high impact on confidentiality and integrity, and requires some effort to exploit (high attack complexity and user interaction)
*   **Mitigation:** Johnson Controls recommends upgrading to Metasys Version 9.0 or later and configuring sites with trusted certificates.
*   **Researcher:** The vulnerability was reported by harpocrates.ghost@protonmail.com.
*   **No public exploits:** There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability at the time the advisory was released.
