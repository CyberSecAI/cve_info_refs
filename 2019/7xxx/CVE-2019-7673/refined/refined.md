The provided content relates to CVE-2019-7673.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of a weak hashing algorithm, specifically DES, to store administrator credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Weak hashing algorithm (DES) used for storing administrator credentials

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially crack the DES hash, gaining access to the administrator password.
- With administrator access, attackers could potentially gain full control of the camera, including viewing live feeds, changing settings, and possibly further network compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is by obtaining the administrator hash from the device. 
- Once the hash is obtained, it can be cracked using readily available tools and techniques due to the weakness of the DES hashing algorithm.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to either have direct access to the camera's configuration file or have the ability to intercept network traffic where the hash is being transmitted.
- Once the hash is obtained, the attacker would need to be able to run password cracking tools.
