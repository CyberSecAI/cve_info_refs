Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of PostScript files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The core issue stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during PostScript parsing, which can lead to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information by reading data from memory locations beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While this vulnerability alone leads to information disclosure, the advisory mentions that an attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PostScript Files:** The primary attack vector is through the use of specially crafted PostScript files.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, meaning the victim must open a malicious PostScript file or visit a malicious web page hosting such a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify PostScript files to contain malicious content.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file or visiting a malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   Adobe has released updates to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite.
