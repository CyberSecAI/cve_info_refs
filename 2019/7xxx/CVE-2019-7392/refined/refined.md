- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate access controls for the jk-manager and jk-status web service components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing or insufficient authentication checks on the mentioned web services.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can access the CA PAM Web-UI without authentication, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or configuration modification.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access through the network to the vulnerable jk-manager and jk-status web service components of the CA PAM application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to reach the affected CA PAM system on the network, no authentication is required for the vulnerable components.
