Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The "No Filtering" text filter option in Joomla's Global Configuration overrides child settings, which could be unexpected behavior for users. This is not a vulnerability in itself but could lead to misconfiguration.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The issue stems from the potential for users to unintentionally disable text filtering by choosing the "No Filtering" option at a higher level. This can then allow unfiltered text to be entered, which can lead to an XSS vulnerability. The content suggests the vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

*  **Impact of Exploitation**: If a user sets the text filter to "No Filtering", unfiltered user input can be displayed in the application. An attacker could inject malicious scripts via unfiltered user input, which are then executed in the browsers of other users. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the global text filter settings in Joomla's Global Configuration.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to have the ability to modify the global text filter settings in Joomla, which typically requires administrative or privileged access. The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in a different user's session.

*   **Affected Versions:** Joomla! CMS versions 2.5.0 through 3.9.2 are affected.

*   **Solution:** The solution is to upgrade to Joomla! version 3.9.3 or later, which displays an additional warning message in the configuration dialog about the consequences of selecting "No Filtering".
