Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `WasmBinaryBuilder::getFunctionIndexName(unsigned int)` function of the Binaryen library. This occurs during the processing of a crafted WebAssembly (Wasm) input file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The `getFunctionIndexName` function attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer on the heap. This is indicated by the AddressSanitizer (ASAN) report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a segmentation fault and application crash, which can result in a denial of service.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** While the provided report only shows a crash, heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if exploited more carefully (not demonstrated here).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted WASM Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious WebAssembly input file specifically crafted to exploit the weakness in `getFunctionIndexName` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted WebAssembly file to the vulnerable application. This could be through local file processing or, in more complex scenarios, via a web service that processes user-supplied Wasm.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The vulnerability does not appear to require any special privileges beyond the normal access of the application.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
* The vulnerability was discovered in version prior to commit `0e5e55053c171b138a0cf5aa8a08de8c7714048f`.
* The vulnerability was found using AddressSanitizer(ASAN) and the crash report includes a stack trace.
* A Proof of Concept (POC) is available to reproduce the issue.
* The vulnerable function is called during the `processFunctions` routine which is part of the `read` process during the binary loading.
