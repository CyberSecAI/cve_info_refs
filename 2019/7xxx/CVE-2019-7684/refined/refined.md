Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `com.inxedu.os.common.controller.VideoUploadController#gok4` method in the inxedu application.
*   The application checks the extension of the uploaded file on line 52 but relies on a user-controlled parameter `fileType` to determine allowed file extensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The application allows users to control the `fileType` parameter, which is used to validate the file extension.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `fileType` parameter before using it to check file extensions. This allows attackers to bypass file extension restrictions.
*   **Missing File Extension Whitelist:** Instead of using a server-side defined whitelist of allowed file extensions, it uses the user-supplied parameter `fileType` for validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload malicious files, such as JSP files, by manipulating the `fileType` parameter to include the desired extension.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** After uploading a malicious file (e.g., a JSP file), an attacker can access the file via a web request and execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to upload a file with a specific content and manipulates the `fileType` parameter to include the extension of the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to be able to control the `fileType` parameter during the file upload process.

**Additional Details**
*   The content provides a Proof of Concept (POC) that shows how to upload a JSP file by manipulating the `fileType` parameter. The POC outlines that by including the "jsp" extension in the `fileType` parameter, it is possible to upload the malicious file.
*   The fix suggested is to implement a whitelist of file extensions in the backend.
