## CVE-2019-7227

The provided content describes a path traversal vulnerability in the ABB IDAL FTP server.

- **Root Cause:** The IDAL FTP server doesn't properly validate directory change requests, allowing traversal outside the FTP server's root directory.
- **Vulnerability:** Path traversal due to insufficient validation of directory change requests.
- **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can traverse to arbitrary directories on the hard disk and use FTP functionality to download and upload files. An unauthenticated attacker can use default credentials ("exor/exor") to gain access.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker uses the "cd .." command to navigate outside the server's root directory.
- **Required Capabilities:**
  - An attacker needs network access to the FTP server.
  - Authentication is required, but default credentials ("exor/exor") may be used to bypass authentication.

Affected Systems:
- PB610 Panel Builder 600, order code: 1SAP500900R0101, versions 1.91 ... 2.8.0.367
