The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in cszcms.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection when adding a new user, allowing an attacker to forge a request on behalf of an authenticated administrator to add a new admin account.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability in the `/admin/users/new/add` endpoint.
- Lack of CSRF token validation on the user creation form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can add a new administrator account to the system without the current administrator's knowledge or consent.
- Complete compromise of the system is possible due to the added administrator account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (`one.html`) containing a JavaScript that sends a forged POST request to the vulnerable `/admin/users/new/add` endpoint.
- The victim (an authenticated admin) is tricked into visiting the attacker's page, which executes the malicious JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious web page controlled by the attacker.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft an appropriate POST request to add a user. The proof of concept shows an example of this request including the "csrf_csz" value which appears to be static.
