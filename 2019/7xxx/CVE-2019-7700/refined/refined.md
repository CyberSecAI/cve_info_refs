The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7700.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `wasm::WasmBinaryBuilder::visitCall(wasm::Call*)` function in `wasm-binary.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow. The code attempts to read beyond the allocated memory buffer during the processing of a call instruction in a WASM binary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault (crash) due to an out-of-bounds memory access. It could also potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks like arbitrary code execution, but that is not detailed in this report.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted WASM input file (`BOF.zip` is attached to the issue) can trigger the heap-buffer-overflow during processing by the `wasm-merge` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted WASM file as input to the `wasm-merge` tool, which uses the vulnerable code. This is usually achieved by convincing a user to process a malicious WASM file.
