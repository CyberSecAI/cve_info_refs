{
  "CVE-2019-7656": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Type": "Privilege Escalation",
      "Vendor": "Wowza Media Systems LLC",
      "Product": "Wowza Streaming Engine",
      "Version": "Version 4.8.0 and earlier (fixed in 4.8.5)",
      "Attack Type": "Local",
      "Impact Code Execution": "true",
       "Impact Denial of Service": "false",
      "Confirmed": "true"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The installer sets relaxed permissions on core program files.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insecure file permissions"
      ],
      "Impact": "Any unprivileged Linux user can escalate privileges to root.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Local exploitation by injecting a malicious payload into core program files with relaxed permissions. By doing this, it will run with the same privileges as the Wowza server which is root."
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
          "Ability to write to files in Wowza Streaming Engine directory"
      ]
    },
      "Additional Information": {
        "Details": "The vulnerability exists because the installer sets overly permissive permissions on core program files, allowing any local user to modify them. By injecting a malicious payload into one of these files, and then restarting the Wowza server (for the code to be executed), an attacker can gain root level access."
      }
  }
