# USN-4156-2: SDL vulnerabilities

16 October 2019

Several security issues were fixed in SDL.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libsdl1.2](/security/cves?package=libsdl1.2) - Simple DirectMedia Layer debug files

## Details

USN-4156-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in SDL. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that SDL incorrectly handled certain images. If a user

were tricked into opening a crafted image file, a remote attacker could

use this issue to cause SDL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitary code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libsdl1.2debian](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2)
  -
  [1.2.15-8ubuntu1.1+esm1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2/1.2.15-8ubuntu1.1%2Besm1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libsdl1.2debian](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2)
  -
  [1.2.14-6.4ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2/1.2.14-6.4ubuntu3.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# USN-4156-1: SDL vulnerabilities

15 October 2019

Several security issues were fixed in SDL.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [libsdl1.2](/security/cves?package=libsdl1.2) - Simple DirectMedia Layer

## Details

It was discovered that SDL incorrectly handled certain images. If a user

were tricked into opening a crafted image file, a remote attacker could

use this issue to cause SDL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [libsdl1.2debian](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2)
  -
  [1.2.15+dfsg2-0.1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2/1.2.15%2Bdfsg2-0.1ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [libsdl1.2debian](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2)
  -
  [1.2.15+dfsg1-3ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libsdl1.2/1.2.15%2Bdfsg1-3ubuntu0.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

Debian Bug     : 924610 1014577

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in SDL2, the Simple
DirectMedia Layer library. These vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to
cause a denial of service or result in the execution of arbitrary code if
malformed images or sound files are processed.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.9+dfsg1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libsdl2 packages.

For the detailed security status of libsdl2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/libsdl2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Package        : libsdl1.2
Version        : 1.2.15-10+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-7572 CVE-2019-7573 CVE-2019-7574 CVE-2019-7575
                 CVE-2019-7576 CVE-2019-7577 CVE-2019-7578 CVE-2019-7635
                 CVE-2019-7636 CVE-2019-7637 CVE-2019-7638

The update of libsdl1.2 released as DLA 1713-1 led to a regression, caused
by an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-7637. This issue was known upstream and
resulted, among others, in windows versions from libsdl1.2 failing to set
video mode.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.2.15-10+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libsdl1.2 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

                 CVE-2019-7636 CVE-2019-7637 CVE-2019-7638

The update of libsdl2 released as DLA 1714-1 led to several regressions, as
reported by Avital Ostromich.  These regressions are caused by libsdl1.2
patches for CVE-2019-7637, CVE-2019-7635, CVE-2019-7638 and CVE-2019-7636 being
applied to libsdl2 without adaptations.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2.0.2+dfsg1-6+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libsdl2 packages.
