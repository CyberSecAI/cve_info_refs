- **Vulnerability:** Guest users can add reactions to comments they are not authorized to view by guessing the comment ID.
- **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly validate if a guest user has permission to react to a specific comment before processing the reaction request.
- **Attack Vector:** A guest user crafts a POST request to `/Group1ww/NeNeW/notes/<CommentID>/toggle_award_emoji` with the ID of a comment they cannot see.
- **Impact:** A guest user can react to confidential or otherwise inaccessible comments, which is not intended behavior.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a guest user in a group and be able to guess/determine the ID of a comment that is not visible to them.
