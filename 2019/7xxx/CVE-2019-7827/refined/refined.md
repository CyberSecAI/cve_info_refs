Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the processing of PostScript files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   Specifically, when parsing `imageDistiller` data, the software fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-size, heap-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to provide data that exceeds the buffer's capacity, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (i.e., the user running Adobe Acrobat). This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Files:** An attacker can embed malicious `imageDistiller` data within a PostScript file.
*  **Malicious Pages:** An attacker can host a malicious page that, when visited, triggers the vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PostScript file or webpage containing malicious `imageDistiller` data to the victim.
*   The user must interact with the malicious content (open the file or visit the webpage) for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Steven Seeley (mr_me) of Source Incite.
*   Adobe has released an update to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability is rated as critical by Adobe.
