Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Acrobat Pro DC parses charstring definitions within PostScript files. Specifically, crafted data in the PostScript file can lead to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-Bounds Read: The software reads data from memory locations outside the allocated buffer. This can potentially lead to information disclosure or other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious PostScript File: An attacker can craft a malicious PostScript file that, when opened in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
- Malicious Web Page: A user could be lured to a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability when the user interacts with the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PostScript file or a web page that can trigger the vulnerability. User interaction is required, in the sense that the user needs to open the crafted file or visit the malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, Acrobat Reader DC, Acrobat 2017, and Acrobat Reader 2017, including both Continuous and Classic tracks and across both Windows and macOS platforms
- Adobe released updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Important" in terms of severity, while successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, making it a critical issue for affected users.
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Source Incite.
