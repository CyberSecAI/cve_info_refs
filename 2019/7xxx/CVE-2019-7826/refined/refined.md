  "CVE-2019-7826": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of XFA Template objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when handling XFA Template objects, leading to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a malicious file",
      "Visiting a malicious page"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF or webpage that contains specially crafted XFA Template objects.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered due to the lack of input validation when processing XFA templates, which causes a read beyond the allocated buffer. The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, as detailed in the APSB19-18 bulletin. This bulletin also notes the update and priority rating for this vulnerability as 2 which is considered important. It is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could lead to information disclosure."
