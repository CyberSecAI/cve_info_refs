Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-7312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Prim'X Zed! handles small files within its encrypted containers. By analyzing a Zed container, it is possible to disclose the plaintext content of very small files (a few bytes) stored inside.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of plaintext data from small files within the encrypted container. The encryption mechanism is not effective for very small files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in small files within the Zed! container. This is especially critical if the files contain passwords, tokens, or other confidential data.
*   The impact is rated as low, indicating that the amount of data exposed is small, but the nature of that data could still have significant consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Analysis of Zed! Containers:** An attacker needs to gain access to a Zed! container file and perform analysis techniques to extract the plaintext data. The specifics of how this analysis is conducted is not detailed.
*   **Network (N):** The attack vector is considered "Network," suggesting that the attacker could obtain the container file through network means, but not necessarily require network access to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Zed! Container Files:** The attacker must first possess or gain access to a Zed! container file. This might be through theft, exfiltration from a compromised system, or other means.
*   **Analysis Capability:** The attacker needs to have the technical expertise and tools to analyze the Zed! container and uncover the plaintext data.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Encryption Keys Not Compromised:** The security bulletin explicitly states that the encryption keys and user access keys are not compromised by this vulnerability. The vulnerability is in the encryption implementation for very small files.
*   **Vendor Discovery:** The flaw was discovered internally by Prim'X Labs.
*   **Affected Products:** A wide range of Zed! products and versions are affected including: ZoneCentral, ZedMail, Zed! Enterprise, Zed! Pro, and Zed! Free for Windows, Mac and Linux.
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor has released updates to address the vulnerability, and users are advised to update their software.
