The content discusses two time-based SQL injection vulnerabilities in baijiacmsV4.

- **Vulnerability:** Time-based SQL injection
- **Location:**
  - `index.php` with the `cate` parameter.
  - `index.php` with the `order` parameter.
- **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `cate` and `order` parameters in the URL with a `sleep()` function, an attacker can cause a time delay on the server, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by exploiting these SQL injection points.
- **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `cate` and `order` parameters before using it in a SQL query.

The provided Proof of Concept (POC) URLs demonstrate how to inject malicious SQL code that includes a `sleep()` function. By observing the delay in the server's response, the vulnerability can be confirmed.
