Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the reflected XSS vulnerability in ZoneMinder's `download.php` script (CVE-2019-7332):

*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The `download.php` script prints the `eid` (Event ID) parameter on the webpage without proper sanitization or escaping.

*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the victim's browser, leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement
    *   Other client-side attacks.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload and entice a user to click on it.
*   **Example Payload:** `<script>alert('1');</script>`
