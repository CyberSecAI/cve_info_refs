The provided content relates to CVE-2019-7346.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a weak implementation of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in ZoneMinder v1.33.1. When a CSRF check fails, a callback function displays a failure message along with a "Try again" button. This button allows resending the failed request without proper CSRF token validation, effectively bypassing the intended protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate CSRF protection: The system attempts to implement CSRF protection, but it fails because the "Try again" button effectively bypasses the CSRF check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- CSRF Attack: An attacker can craft a malicious request targeting a user, exploiting the weak CSRF protection.
- Actions on Behalf of User: If a user clicks the "Try again" button after a failed CSRF attempt, their action can be re-sent and executed, enabling an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious Link/Website: An attacker can embed a malicious request in a link or on a webpage that, when accessed by a logged-in ZoneMinder user, triggers the CSRF attack by initiating a request to the ZoneMinder server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Logged-in victim: The attacker requires that the victim be logged into their ZoneMinder account.
- Attacker must convince the victim to click the malicious link/access a malicious webpage and then click the "Try Again" button on the error page.
