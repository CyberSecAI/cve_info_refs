The provided content describes a vulnerability in Boolector, specifically an out-of-bounds write in the `pusht_bfr` function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a specific input file containing the line "2147483649 sort". This input leads to an out-of-bounds write in the `pusht_bfr` function when parsing the input file. The issue is related to how Boolector handles large numbers when parsing the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The `pusht_bfr` function writes data outside of the allocated memory buffer.
- Improper input validation: The code doesn't properly validate the large integer input, causing an incorrect memory allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The out-of-bounds write can lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in a crash, denial of service, or other unexpected behavior. In this case, the provided logs show a crash due to the memory corruption detected by Valgrind.
- While ASAN failed to detect the write, likely due to memory mapping issues, Valgrind clearly identifies an invalid write of size 8 at the `pusht_bfr` function

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a crafted input file containing a large integer value for the "sort" keyword to the `boolector` command-line tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious input file to the Boolector application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified through fuzzing and confirmed with both ASAN and Valgrind.
- The provided crash logs indicate an attempt to write to an invalid memory address.
- Minimal reproducing input was provided: `2147483649 sort`
- A fix was not found within the issue.
- The vulnerable code was in `pusht_bfr`, called by `new_line_bfr`, and `btor2parser_read_lines`.
