A vulnerability in FireOS, the Amazon Fire Tablet’s operating system, has been patched.

A vulnerability in the operating system of Amazon’s Fire Tablets could allow a hacker to inject malicious content into Settings, Legal and Compliance, Terms of Use and Privacy sections of the device. The bug could also allow an adversary to capture the serial number of the tablet.

The Fire Tablet (formerly known as the Kindle Fire) is Amazon’s budget slate that runs on Amazon’s FireOS operating system. Researchers with Nightwatch Cybersecurity on Thursday said that the FireOS operating system is open to a limited context man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker could secretly relay and possibly alter communications to inject malicious content.

The issue was discovered in FireOS v5.3.6.3 in September and fixed by the vendor in v5.3.6.4, which was released in November 2018. Public disclosure of the vulnerability was Thursday Feb. 7.

The root cause of the vulnerability, CVE-2019-7399, is in the setting section of FireOS, which lacks HTTPS for some content, researchers said. “While monitoring network traffic on a test device, we observed that several calls from the settings section are done without HTTPS and can be injected with malicious content by an MitM attacker,” according to a [post outlining the flaw](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/02/07/content-injection-in-amazon-kindles-fireos-cve-2019-7399/).

Exposed Traffic

Specifically, the lack of HTTPS support impacts HTML-based content identified as Settings, Legal and Compliance, Terms of Use and the Privacy sections, a Nightwatch Cybersecurity spokesperson told Threatpost.

These settings lack HTTPS, which encrypts data between the browser and website. That in turn leaves traffic and the serial number of the device wide open for remote attackers to observe and tamper with.

MitM attacks can be used not only to manipulate content, but have been used to inject malicious code into targeted devices or used to coax victims into following rogue links and downloading booby-trapped files.

“Customer trust is important to us and we take security seriously,” an Amazon spokesperson told Threatpost. “Customers do not need to take any action as their devices have been automatically updated with security fixes for this issue.”

Thursday’s notice is the first public disclosure of the flaw in accordance with Nightwatch Cybersecurity’s vulnerability disclosure guidelines.

“Most Kindle devices will automatically update to the latest version but users who disabled updates should update to the latest version,” researchers said.

Security researcher Yakov Shafranovich is credited with discovering the vulnerability.

**Proof-of-Concept Attack**

Researchers outlined the proof of concept for the attack in their post.

The attacker would not need physical access to the vulnerable Fire Tablet. However targets would need to be tricked to join a malicious WiFi network or be on the same public WiFi network as a victim.

Once the victim is  on the same local network, an attacker would need to install on a close proximity Linux host the small lightweight DNS server called Dnsmasq along with the Nginx web server software.

From there an attacker could modify the host’s “/etc/hosts” file to add an entry (192.168.1.x www.kindle.com, 192.168.1.x kindle.com) that in turn lets them map the Fire Tablet domain name to the Linux host -and track the unencrypted traffic from the vulnerable “Settings” sections. Then they can take it a step further by adding a file with malicious content to the domain.

“At this point – the [FireOS] device will resolve DNS against the Linux computer and serve the large servers file,” researchers said. From there, they could tap through any of the vulnerable settings sections and observe the injected content.

In other words, if the user were to look at the vulnerable Settings, or related sections of their device, they would see the injected content.

“The user needs to click terms of use or privacy policy links, those normally render web content that Amazon serves, instead the attacker’s web page would be served,” a spokesperson told Threatpost. “When the user taps those links, there is an embedded WebView which renders HTML content… instead it will render the attacker’s content.”

While the malicious content would be injected into the “Settings” sections of the Fire Tablet, it is “unknown if the attacker can pivot from there into other parts of the device,” researchers told Threatpost.

It’s not the first security issue that the popular e-readers have faced. In 2014, a researcher found that [a security flaw](http://b.fl7.de/2014/09/amazon-stored-xss-book-metadata.html) in Amazon’s website could allow malicious links to be added to Kindle e-books – which could ultimately be used to compromise a person’s Amazon.com account.

# Content Injection in Amazon Kindle’s FireOS [CVE-2019-7399]

[February 7, 2019February 7, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/02/07/content-injection-in-amazon-kindles-fireos-cve-2019-7399/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[amazon](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/amazon/), [Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [fireos](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/fireos/), [kindle](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/kindle/)

## Summary

The **FireOS** operating system provided by **Amazon** for **Fire** tablet devices can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. An attacker can also capture the serial number of the device. The root cause is lack of HTTPS for legal content (terms of use and privacy policy) within the settings section.

The issue was discovered in FireOS **v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. **CVE-2019-7399** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

FireOS is an operating system provided by Amazon for the Fire tablet devices.  It is a customized fork of Android. While monitoring network traffic on a test device, we observed that several calls from the settings section (terms of use and privacy policy) are done without HTTPS and can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. It is also possible for the attacker to observe this traffic and capture the serial number (DSN) of the device.

Screenshots of the captured traffic:

![Screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-20](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-20.png?w=300&h=281) ![Screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-26](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-26-1.png?w=300&h=295)

## **Steps To Replicate (on Ubuntu 18.04)**

1. Install the application on the Android device but do not start it.

2. Install **dnsmasq** and **NGINX** on the Linux host:

```
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq nginx

```

3. Modify the **/etc/hosts** file to add the following entry to map the domain name to the Linux host:

```
192.168.1.x www.kindle.com
192.168.1.x kindle.com
```

4. Configure **/etc/dnsmasq.conf** file to listen on the IP and restart DNSMASQ

```
listen-address=192.168.1.x
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```

5. Add a file with malicious content (you may need to use sudo):

```
cd /var/www/html
mkdir support
echo powned >support/privacy
echo powned >support/terms

```

6. Modify the settings on the Kindle device to static, set DNS to point to “192.168.1.x”. AT THIS POINT – the Kindle device will resolve DNS against the Linux computer and serve the large servers file

7. Tap “Settings”, “Legal and Compliance”, and tap either “Terms of Use” or “Privacy”. Observe injected content.

## Vendor Response and Mitigation

The issue was discovered in **FireOS v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. MITRE assigned **CVE-2019-7399** to track this issue.

# Third Party Android App Storing Facebook Data Insecurely (Facebook Data Abuse Program)

[February 14, 2019February 15, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/02/14/third-party-android-app-storing-facebook-data-insecurely/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)[Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [facebook](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/facebook/)

## Summary

A third-party Android application with Facebook API access was found to be copying user data into storage outside of Facebook, and storing it insecurely in two separate locations. This issue was reported to Facebook via their Data Abuse Bounty program and the insecure storage locations have been secured on November 12th, 2018. The Facebook app associated with this application has been removed from the Facebook platform but the Android application remains available in Google’s Play Store. The number of affected users is unknown. **[ADDED: 02/15/2019 – Google has been notified].**

## Background

In April 2018, FaceBook announced [a new Data Abuse Bounty program](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-abuse-bounty/) that rewards “*people with first-hand knowledge and proof of cases where a Facebook platform app collects and transfers people’s data to another party to be sold, stolen or used for scams or political influence*“.

In September 2018, we found an Android application in the Google Play store that purports to provide additional functionality to Facebook users that is not available through the platform. At the time of writing, the application had more than 1,000,000 downloads. After downloading the application, and examining it using [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx), we found that the application was using Facebook APIs to access data for the logged in user and copying to several storage locations outside of Facebook. Upon further examination, it was clear that at least two of such locations (a Firebase database and an API server) were making this data available without any authentication and without HTTPS. This would allow an attacker to mass download the user data accumulated by the application from its users.

We do not know for sure how many users have been impacted or exposed, but one of the databases accessed contained over 1,000,000 records. **[ADDED: 02/15/2019 – The application purported to provide additional statistical information about the logged-in user’s Facebook account. There is a privacy policy within the application but it is ambiguous about the transfer of data].**

### Issue #1 – Storing user data in an public Firebase database

During our examination of the application, we located a Firebase database that the application was communicating with. The database was configured in test mode, which allowed anonymous public access by visiting the URL of “**<https://DATABASE.firebaseio.com/.json>**“. As seen in the attached screenshot, the database contained data obtained from Facebook. Aside from confirming the initial permission issue, we did not access or explore this database any further.

### Issue #2 – Storing user data in a non-SSL server without authentication

During our examination of application, it become clear that the server that the application was communicating with, did not use SSL and was being accessed without authentication. As seen below, this would allow an attacker to download the data collected by the application from Facebook via a regular browser as well as spy on any connections between the application and the server. Aside from confirming the initial permission issue, we did not access or explore this database any further.

## Vendor Response and Mitigation

We contacted the Facebook Data Abuse Bounty program but did not contact the vendor directly. After Facebook completed its review, the two insecure locations have been secured on November 12th, 2018. The Facebook app associated with this application has been removed from the Facebook platform but the Android application remains available in Google’s Play Store. **[ADDED: 02/15/2019 – Google has been notified]**.

This discovery qualified under the terms of the Facebook Data Abuse Bounty Program and a bounty payment has been received.

# Content Injection in Amazon Kindle’s FireOS [CVE-2019-7399]

[February 7, 2019February 7, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/02/07/content-injection-in-amazon-kindles-fireos-cve-2019-7399/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[amazon](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/amazon/), [Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [fireos](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/fireos/), [kindle](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/kindle/)

## Summary

The **FireOS** operating system provided by **Amazon** for **Fire** tablet devices can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. An attacker can also capture the serial number of the device. The root cause is lack of HTTPS for legal content (terms of use and privacy policy) within the settings section.

The issue was discovered in FireOS **v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. **CVE-2019-7399** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

FireOS is an operating system provided by Amazon for the Fire tablet devices.  It is a customized fork of Android. While monitoring network traffic on a test device, we observed that several calls from the settings section (terms of use and privacy policy) are done without HTTPS and can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. It is also possible for the attacker to observe this traffic and capture the serial number (DSN) of the device.

Screenshots of the captured traffic:

![Screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-20](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-20.png?w=300&h=281) ![Screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-26](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-26-1.png?w=300&h=295)

## **Steps To Replicate (on Ubuntu 18.04)**

1. Install the application on the Android device but do not start it.

2. Install **dnsmasq** and **NGINX** on the Linux host:

```
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq nginx

```

3. Modify the **/etc/hosts** file to add the following entry to map the domain name to the Linux host:

```
192.168.1.x www.kindle.com
192.168.1.x kindle.com
```

4. Configure **/etc/dnsmasq.conf** file to listen on the IP and restart DNSMASQ

```
listen-address=192.168.1.x
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```

5. Add a file with malicious content (you may need to use sudo):

```
cd /var/www/html
mkdir support
echo powned >support/privacy
echo powned >support/terms

```

6. Modify the settings on the Kindle device to static, set DNS to point to “192.168.1.x”. AT THIS POINT – the Kindle device will resolve DNS against the Linux computer and serve the large servers file

7. Tap “Settings”, “Legal and Compliance”, and tap either “Terms of Use” or “Privacy”. Observe injected content.

## Vendor Response and Mitigation

The issue was discovered in **FireOS v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. MITRE assigned **CVE-2019-7399** to track this issue.

# Content Injection in Amazon Kindle’s FireOS [CVE-2019-7399]

[February 7, 2019February 7, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/02/07/content-injection-in-amazon-kindles-fireos-cve-2019-7399/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Advisories](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/advisories/)[amazon](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/amazon/), [Android](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/android/), [fireos](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/fireos/), [kindle](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/kindle/)

## Summary

The **FireOS** operating system provided by **Amazon** for **Fire** tablet devices can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. An attacker can also capture the serial number of the device. The root cause is lack of HTTPS for legal content (terms of use and privacy policy) within the settings section.

The issue was discovered in FireOS **v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. **CVE-2019-7399** has been assigned by MITRE to track this issue.

## Vulnerability Details

FireOS is an operating system provided by Amazon for the Fire tablet devices.  It is a customized fork of Android. While monitoring network traffic on a test device, we observed that several calls from the settings section (terms of use and privacy policy) are done without HTTPS and can be injected with malicious content by an MITM attacker. It is also possible for the attacker to observe this traffic and capture the serial number (DSN) of the device.

Screenshots of the captured traffic:

![Screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-20](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-20.png?w=300&h=281) ![Screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-26](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/screenshot_2018-09-03-13-11-26-1.png?w=300&h=295)

## **Steps To Replicate (on Ubuntu 18.04)**

1. Install the application on the Android device but do not start it.

2. Install **dnsmasq** and **NGINX** on the Linux host:

```
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq nginx

```

3. Modify the **/etc/hosts** file to add the following entry to map the domain name to the Linux host:

```
192.168.1.x www.kindle.com
192.168.1.x kindle.com
```

4. Configure **/etc/dnsmasq.conf** file to listen on the IP and restart DNSMASQ

```
listen-address=192.168.1.x
sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```

5. Add a file with malicious content (you may need to use sudo):

```
cd /var/www/html
mkdir support
echo powned >support/privacy
echo powned >support/terms

```

6. Modify the settings on the Kindle device to static, set DNS to point to “192.168.1.x”. AT THIS POINT – the Kindle device will resolve DNS against the Linux computer and serve the large servers file

7. Tap “Settings”, “Legal and Compliance”, and tap either “Terms of Use” or “Privacy”. Observe injected content.

## Vendor Response and Mitigation

The issue was discovered in **FireOS v5.3.6.3** and fixed by the vendor in **v5.3.6.4** that was released in **November 2018.** Devices will automatically update to the latest version. MITRE assigned **CVE-2019-7399** to track this issue.
