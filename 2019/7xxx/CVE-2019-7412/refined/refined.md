{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The PS PHPCaptcha WP plugin before v1.2.0 for WordPress mishandles sanitization of input values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Lack of checking the number of characters"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (preventing the creation of CAPTCHA)",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote authenticated users can set the `$stringlength` parameter with a large integer."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Remote authenticated user with access to the plugin settings"
    ],
    "details": "The plugin does not define or check `$MinStringLength` and `$MaxStringLength` allowing an attacker to set the `$stringlength` variable with an extremely large number which results in a denial of service because the CAPTCHA cannot be created."
