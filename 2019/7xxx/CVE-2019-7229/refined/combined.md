XL-19-005 - ABB HMI Absence of Signature Verification Vulnerability
========================================================================

Identifiers
-----------
XL-19-005
CVE-2019-7229
ABBVU-IAMF-1902003
ABBVU-IAMF-1902012

CVSS Score
----------
8.3 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Affected vendor
---------------
ABB (new.abb.com)

Credit
------
xen1thLabs - Software Labs

Vulnerability summary
---------------------
ABB HMI uses two different transmission methods to upgrade its software components:

-   Utilization of USB/SD Card to flash the device
-   Remote provisioning process via ABB Panel Builder 600 over FTP

Neither of these transmission methods implement any form of encryption or authenticity checks against the new HMI
software binary files.

Technical details
-----------------
Neither of the update mechanisms implement encryption or authentication checks on the new binaries of the HMI Software
components. An attacker could therefore take over the HMI by manipulating these .dll or .exe files to execute arbitrary
code on the system.

The following Windows CE ARM executable was pushed to the HMI target via FTP and replaced an already existing binary
resulting in remote code execution.

Proof of concept
----------------
```
// Code Snippet

#pragma comment(linker, "/ENTRY:ChangedEntry /NODEFAULTLIB /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWSCE")

void ChangedEntry()

{

printf("Remote Code Execution!");

LPCWSTR buff = L"Software Labs Remote Code Execution Proof of Concept";

LPCWSTR a = L"RCE Vuln";

MessageBox(0, buff, a, MB_OK | MB_ICONQUESTION);

}
```
