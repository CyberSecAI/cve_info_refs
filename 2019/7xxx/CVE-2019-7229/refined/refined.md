  "vulnerability_information": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-7229",
    "root_cause": "The ABB HMI software update mechanisms (USB/SD card flashing and remote provisioning via ABB Panel Builder 600 over FTP) lack encryption and authentication checks for new HMI software binaries.",
    "vulnerability": "Absence of signature verification.",
    "impact": "An attacker could take over the HMI by manipulating .dll or .exe files to execute arbitrary code on the system, leading to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can replace existing binaries on the HMI by exploiting the lack of authentication during software updates.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to either write to the USB/SD card used for flashing the device, or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the FTP connection used for remote provisioning.",
