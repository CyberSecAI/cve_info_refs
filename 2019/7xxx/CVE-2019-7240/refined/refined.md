{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The WinRing0x64.sys driver, part of the Moo0 System Monitor application, exposes the `wrmsr` instruction to user-mode callers without properly validating the target Model Specific Register (MSR).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of target MSR in IOCTL 0x9C402088 leading to arbitrary ring 0 code execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary unsigned code execution in Ring 0.",
  "Attack vectors": "User-mode application calling the driver's IOCTL 0x9C402088.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to load the vulnerable driver, or have admin rights, and the ability to call the driver's IOCTL."
