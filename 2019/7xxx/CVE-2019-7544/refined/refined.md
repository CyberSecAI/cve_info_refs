The provided content describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MyWebSQL version 3.7 and earlier.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Add User` function within the `User Manager` page. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `User Name` field, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Lack of input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, such as mining scripts or other payloads, which executes when a user interacts with the vulnerable page.
- The XSS payload executes when a user logs in with the injected user.
- The injected scripts could potentially allow attackers to perform malicious actions, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users, or modifying page content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `User Name` field of the `Add User` form within the `User Manager` pages of the application.
- The attacker needs to access the user manager functionality and have privileges to add a new user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have database access credentials to access the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to add a user through the `User Manager` interface.
