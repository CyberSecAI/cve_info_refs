The provided content pertains to CVE-2019-7306.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `byobu` package for Ubuntu included a file `debian/source_byobu.py` which is an Apport hook. This hook attached the user's `~/.screenrc` file to crash reports. This file may contain sensitive information, such as passwords, usernames, and hostnames.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of the `~/.screenrc` file, a user's private dot file, which may contain sensitive information, in crash reports generated by the `byobu` package. This information could be exposed in public bug reports.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive user information, such as passwords, usernames, and hostnames, if the user includes such information in their `~/.screenrc` file. This could lead to unauthorized access to systems or accounts. The vulnerability is considered a privacy breach even if the file does not include sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when the `byobu` application crashes or when the user manually generates a bug report file. The included sensitive data from `~/.screenrc` could then be uploaded to external bug report databases if automatic crash reporting is enabled or if the user manually uploads it. A local or remote attacker could maliciously cause Byobu to crash, triggering the Apport hook and potentially leaking the information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the byobu package installed on a system where the user has set sensitive data in their `~/.screenrc` file. The attacker must cause byobu to crash or trick the user into creating a bug report for the vulnerability to occur. If the connection to bug databases is unencrypted, the information could be intercepted through network traffic as well.
