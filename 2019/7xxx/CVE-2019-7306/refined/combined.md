### Bug Description

OVERVIEW

--------

Author: Sander Bos

Author's e-mail address: sbos \_at\_ sbosnet \_dot\_ nl

Author's website: <<https://www.sbosnet.nl/>>

CVE identifier: requested

Date: 2019-04-19

Report version: 2

SUMMARY

-------

The Ubuntu "byobu" package contains a security vulnerability which may

lead to disclosure of private as well as sensitive information in case

a bug or crash report file gets created by the user or in case the

application crashes, with this report file then being uploaded to an

external crash report database, all through the Ubuntu "Apport" crash

report framework.

The vulnerability is specific to the Ubuntu (and Debian) byobu package

(and potentially derivate OS packages, for example Linux Mint), and not

present in the upstream application itself (although it is in fact part

of the upstream source code repository).

DESCRIPTION

-----------

"Byobu" [1, 2] is a text-based window manager, terminal multiplexer,

and integrated DevOps environment which can act as an enhancement to

the GNU Screen and tmux applications. It was initially developed for

Ubuntu, and is nowadays available in many GNU/Linux distributions as

well as macOS and some BSD operating systems.

The Ubuntu "byobu" package adds a file "debian/source\_byobu.py" [3] to

the program. This file acts as a so-called "package hook" for the Ubuntu

"Apport" crash report framework [4]. When a Byobu process crashes,

or when the user manually creates a bug report file for the program,

a local crash or bug report file gets created. This report file may be

amended with additional information, as defined by the package hook file.

The resulting report file may then be uploaded to an external bug report

database like Launchpad [5] or the Ubuntu Error Tracker [6].

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the debian/source\_byobu.py package

hook file includes the user's ~/.screenrc file (line numbers prepended):

10 def add\_info(report):

    [...]

 13 attach\_file\_if\_exists(report, path.expanduser('~/.screenrc'), 'ScreenRC')

This file however is a user's private dot file, which should therefore

probably not be attached to the report at all to begin with. Specifically

though the file may contain actual sensitive information, including but

not limited to passwords, user names, and host names.

Thus, private and / or sensitive user information may end up in external

bug databases and (potentially public) bug reports. This applies

specifically in case the system on which the application crashed is

configured to automatically upload Apport crash reports without asking

the user's permission or requiring any user intervention at all.

The vulnerability is specific to the Ubuntu (and Debian) byobu package

(and potentially derivate OS packages, for example Linux Mint), and not

present in the upstream application itself.

VULNERABILITY IMPACT

--------------------

The general vulnerability impact type of this vulnerability is disclosure

of sensitive information potentially including but not limited to

passwords, user names, and host names.

The leakage of such sensitive information from the ~/.screenrc file is

the core of this security vulnerability. However, even when the file

does not (or would never) include sensitive information like passwords,

sending out a user dot file like ~/.screenrc could still be considered

a privacy infringement on itself.

The following are examples of GNU Screen commands which may be included

in ~/.screenrc files [7] and contain sensitive (or at least private)

information (this list should not be considered exhaustive):

- "password" (may contain passwords);

- "su" (may include user names and passwords);

- all "\*acl\*" options and "umask" (involve ACLs, contain user names,

  and may contain passwords);

- "screen" (may contain host name and connection information regarding

  TELNET connections to, for example, (administrative interfaces of)

  internal-only hosts on an internal network);

- "at", "command", "eval", "exec", "shell", "source", and other commands

  concerned with to be executed (shell) commands.

Even though Byobu can be used on many different GNU/Linux distributions

and other operating systems, the vulnerability only applies to the Ubuntu

and Debian packages (and potentially derivative package versions, for

example Linux Mint). In addition, for the vulnerability to be exploitable

the system needs to have the Apport framework installed and enabled.

This is the case by default on Ubuntu, and may be the case on at least

SUSE based systems as well as the Debian "experimental" distribution.

As additional requirement factors Byobu needs to crash for the

vulnerability to occur (or the user needs to manually create a bug

report), and the crash report needs to be uploaded to an external bug

database, either manually by the user or automatically by the Apport

framework. A crash could happen as a result of regular application usage,

but it may also be maliciously caused by a (local or remote) attacker

by means of additional exploitative factors (e.g., Byobu application or

terminal related bugs). If the connection to the external bug databases

is unencrypted, the information may also leak by means of captured

network traffic.

PROOF OF CONCEPT (PoC)

----------------------

The following example demonstrates the vulnerability on a default

installation of Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, showing the contents of the

user's ~/.screenrc file being included in the bug report file:

$ echo "secret" > ~/.screenrc

   $ apport-cli --save /tmp/reportfile /usr/bin/byobu

\*\*\* Collecting problem information

The collected information can be sent to the developers to improve the

   application. This might take a few minutes.

   [...]

   $ grep "ScreenRC" /tmp/reportfile

   ScreenRC: secret

The above example manually creates a bug report file by directly calling

apport-cli(1) [8] on the Byobu binary. The bug report file may then get

uploaded to a remote bug reporting database, making the contents of the

~/.screenrc file end up in a (potentially public) bug report.

As an alternative PoC example an actual crash report could be generated

by manually crashing a Byobu process (using for example "kill -11")

and then running apport-cli(1) on the, initially limited, crash report

file in /var/crash/. The end result would however be equal.

VULNERABLE UBUNTU RELEASES / PACKAGE VERSIONS

---------------------------------------------

The vulnerability was introduced in the upstream Byobu source code

repository on 2009-07-09 as part of adding the Apport package hook file,

in Bazaar revision 648 [9].

The first Ubuntu package version containing the vulnerability was

2.20-0ubuntu1, released 2009-07-12 [10]. Assumably all Ubuntu and Debian

package versions from that version on have been vulnerable.

Currently, the following supported Ubuntu versions with their respective

byobu package versions are vulnerable [11]:

Ubuntu 19.04: 5.127-0ubuntu1

Ubuntu 18.10: 5.127-0ubuntu1

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS: 5.125-0ubuntu1

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS: 5.106-0ubuntu1

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: 5.77-0ubuntu1.2

Ubuntu 12.04 ESM: 5.17-0ubuntu1

(Note: the package version listed for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM is actually the

version from Ubuntu 12.04 LTS; an unchecked assumption is made here that

the version in Ubuntu 12.04 ESM did not change after Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

transitioned to Ubuntu 12.04 ESM.)

It should be noted that the byobu package gets installed by default in

the Ubuntu Server editions of several Ubuntu releases.

Byobu is also available on many other GNU/Linux distributions as well as

macOS and some BSD systems, but the Apport hook will only get executed

on systems which have Apport installed and running. Aside from Ubuntu,

this might include SUSE based systems as well as the Debian "experimental"

distribution.

PROPOSED FIXES / WORKAROUNDS

----------------------------

An immediate workaround for Ubuntu users and administrators would be

to remove the byobu package Apport package hook file from the system,

being /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/source\_byobu.py.

As a proposed source code / package fix, the byobu package Apport

hook should not include the complete user's ~/.screenrc file, but at

least filter out all sensitive information that the file may contain.

This includes for example the "password" option line and other commands

mentioned in the "VULNERABILITY IMPACT" section above.

As this may not be sufficient and still include information which should

not be sent out, a better approach might be to use a whitelist of lines

to include instead of a filter of lines to exclude.

Aside from actual sensitive information contained in the user's

~/.screenrc file however, which could be considered the core vulnerability

of this report, the file simply is a user's private dot file which

should probably not be uploaded to remote sites by Apport hooks at all.

This applies specifically since uploading of Apport reports could even

happen without the user's consent or even knowledge, for example when

automatic crash report uploads are configured on the system.

It should also be (re)considered whether or not any contents from a

~/.screenrc file could be responsible for a Byobu application crash to

begin with, or why this information would be helpful to developers in

resolving a crash (or allowed to be known by developers via this route

at all).

Thus, probably the safest and best solution would be to not include the

~/.screenrc file in crash reports at all.

If filtering out specific contents or using a while list approach while

still including the ~/.screenrc file on itself in reports is chosen as a

fix instead of not including the file at all, then an additional measure

of explicitly asking the user whether or not to include the file should

be implemented. This may be done by for example using the "ui.yesno()"

interactive user interface function from Apport [12] as also implemented

in Apport package hooks from several other packages, for example the

Apport package hook from the Ubuntu "openssh-client" package [13].

In addition, and generally speaking, Apport hooks from packages should

probably never attach private files from users (either dot files or

differently named files, either from user's home directories or other

private directories) since / in case this poses a (potential) privacy

infringement. At the least, such package hooks should always ask the

user's explicit permission. It should also always be investigated if

any potential security impact is involved, for example by potentially

including passwords or other sensitive information.

REPORT REVISION HISTORY

-----------------------

2019-04-10: Version 1: initial version sent to Ubuntu Security Team.

2019-04-19: Version 2: added Ubuntu 19.04 to vulnerable Ubuntu versions list,

                       added workaround information, added "ui.yesno()"

                       information to fix proposal, various minor improvements.

The .screenrc file format description does indicate that a password can be set in it (<https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#Detach>) so it does appear that in theory this could be a privacy problem.

There are not many bugs filed against Ubuntu's byobu package (just 10 currently) and it doesn't look like any of them have the .screenrc anyway. Dropping the inclusion of .screenrc in the apport hook looks like it wouldn't adversely affect bug collection for this package; the rare cases where it might be needed could just be handled manually.

The apport hook also includes some general information about the installed screen binaries. It looks like there have been some situations in the past where extraneous screen bits could cause confusion (e.g. lp #390808 comments #6-9) that may be the reason for that. This may be of limited usefulness, but seems of minimal risk.

So, dropping the inclusion of the .screenrc seems like a sensible path for resolving this issue.

Sander Bos, thank you for your research and report. I agree that this is a potential privacy leak and it should be fixed, and I appreciate the work you've done in identifying it. However, while your work does identify a worthwhile improvement, I think that calling this a security vulnerability is a stretch, given the following. Please do correct me if I'm factually wrong. The following points are believe objective and not a matter of opinion:

1. The PoC is incomplete since it misses an essential piece. An attacker cannot use it. It doesn't show how an attacker could make the apport hook fire, which is essential for the privacy leak to happen.

2. Apport and whoopsie were designed with privacy leak risks in mind, and always give the user the opportunity to view a report before sending it, in part to ensure that no sensitive information is present. The exception is if automatic crash reporting is enabled, but this is an explicit user opt-in.

3. The user must have had to have placed sensitive data in ~/.screenrc. I understand that users may do this, but it does have to be an explicit user action and is not the default case.

In my opinion, the above three factors make it questionable that this is a security vulnerability at all. If it is, it certainly has an exceeding low severity. We don't currently see any reports where these three things have come together.

Nevertheless, I agree that it makes sense to adjust the apport hook to avoid attaching ~/.screenrc. Certainly if one of the factors above turned out to be less of a barrier, making this change now would mitigate that future vulnerability. Thank you again for bringing this to our attention.

CVE classified as low, and Paride talked with Amurray and SRUs are not needed on this.

If security wants to push it still the patch is in the repo of byobu.
