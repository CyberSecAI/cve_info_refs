CVE-2019-7425:
  - Root cause: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Administration zone "/netflow/jspui/linkdownalertConfig.jsp" file due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
  - Weakness: The application fails to properly sanitize the 'task' parameter before including it in the generated HTML.
  - Impact: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or the redirection of the user to a malicious website.
  - Attack vector: By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the 'task' parameter.
  - Required attacker capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click on the malicious link.
