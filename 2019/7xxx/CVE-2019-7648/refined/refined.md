The provided content relates to CVE-2019-7648, specifically the issue of using Base64 encoding for password storage.

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses Base64 encoding to store passwords, which is a reversible encoding, not an encryption or hashing method.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Inadequate password protection. Base64 encoding is easily reversible and does not provide any real security for sensitive data like passwords.
    - The system fails to protect passwords against exposure.
* **Impact of exploitation:** If the database or password storage is compromised, attackers can easily decode the passwords and gain unauthorized access to user accounts and the application.
* **Attack vectors:** Access to the database or password storage mechanism.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to gain access to the system where the Base64-encoded passwords are stored.
