```
CVE-2019-7397
```
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a memory leak in the `WritePDFImage` function located in `coders/pdf.c`. Specifically, the memory allocated for `xref` is not properly released when the function returns `MagickFalse` at certain points within the code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a memory leak. The `xref` variable, which is dynamically allocated using `AcquireQuantumMemory` or `ResizeQuantumMemory`, is not freed when the function returns `MagickFalse` in specific cases. This leads to an unreferenced memory block.
Multiple locations are affected by this same memory leak pattern within the function: L1902, L1912, L1965, L2011, L2021, L2082, L2179, L2427, L2437, L2488, L2529, L2539, L2594, L2682, and L2894.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a memory leak. Repeated exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to the exhaustion of available memory, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
While the SUSE information categorizes the vulnerability as low, the NVD score gives it a high availability impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the processing of a crafted PDF image by ImageMagick, which triggers the memory leak within the vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PDF image to an application utilizing ImageMagick. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attacker can be local or remote and doesn't need any privileges.

The provided content provides details on the specific locations and conditions of the memory leak within `WritePDFImage`, which is more granular than the general description typically given in a CVE.
