{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of input validation in the buildbot redirection code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CRLF injection",
    "Cross domain cookie injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Compromise other sites hosted on the same domain as Buildbot. This includes cookie injection on a master domain, potentially impacting other websites. HTTP response splitting and cache poisoning are also possible, though potentially impractical to exploit.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting CRLF characters (%0d%0a) into the 'redirect' parameter of the /auth/login and /auth/logout endpoints.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the Buildbot server, manipulating the 'redirect' parameter."
