# CVE ID

* [CVE-2019-7313](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7313)

# Type

* CRLF injection
* Cross domain cookie injection

# Schedule

* **Reported**: 29 Jan 2019
* **Fix merged into master**: 01 feb 2019
* **Fix in a release**: 02 feb 2019

# Description

A CRLF can be injected in Location header of /auth/login and /auth/logout

curl -v <https://buildbot.example.com/auth/logout?redirect=/%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20TEST=TEST>

In the server reply you should see:
set-cookie: TEST=TEST

This is due to lack of input validation in the buildbot redirection code.

# Impact analysis

It was not found a way to impact Buildbot product own security through this vulnerability, but it could be used to compromise other sites hosted on the same domain as Buildbot.

* cookie injection a master domain (ie if your buildbot is on buildbot.buildbot.net, one can inject a cookie on \*.buildbot.net, which could impact another website hosted in your domain)
* HTTP response splitting and cache poisoning (browser or proxy) are also typical impact of this vulnerability class, but might be impractical to exploit.

# Versions vulnerable

Buildbot 0.9.0 to 1.8.0 (included)

# Fixed versions

Buildbot 2.0.0 and 1.8.1

# Mitigations and patches

If Buildbot is hosted behind a reverse proxy, one could use request rewriting in order to filter out `%0d` and `%0a` from requests urls. For NGINX server, add this at the top of your `server` block:

```
if ( $request_uri ~* "%0A|%0D" ) { return 404; }

```

Patch can be applied:

<https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/pull/4584/files#diff-a2e7e3ee5f6a1d3cd9c6abf0328c21e0>

Or install version 2.0.0 or 1.8.1
