# snap - seccomp BBlacklist for TIOCSTI can be Circumvented

#### EDB-ID:

###### 46594

#### CVE:

###### [2019-7303](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-7303)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Google Security Research](/?author=7725)

#### Type:

###### [dos](/?type=dos)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Linux](/?platform=linux)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
snap uses a seccomp filter to prevent the use of the TIOCSTI ioctl; in the
source code, this filter is expressed as follows:

  # TIOCSTI allows for faking input (man tty_ioctl)
  # TODO: this should be scaled back even more
  ioctl - !TIOCSTI

In the X86-64 version of the compiled seccomp filter, this results in the
following BPF bytecode:

  [...]
  0139 if nr == 0x00000010: [true +0, false +3]
  013b   if args[1].high != 0x00000000: [true +205, false +0] -> ret ALLOW (syscalls: ioctl)
  0299   if args[1].low == 0x00005412: [true +111, false +112] -> ret ERRNO
  030a   ret ALLOW (syscalls: ioctl)
  [...]

This bytecode performs a 64-bit comparison; however, the syscall entry point for
ioctl() is defined with a 32-bit command argument in the kernel:

SYSCALL_DEFINE3(ioctl, unsigned int, fd, unsigned int, cmd, unsigned long, arg)
{
  return ksys_ioctl(fd, cmd, arg);
}

This means that setting a bit in the high half of the command parameter will
circumvent the seccomp filter while being ignored by the kernel.

This can be tested as follows on Ubuntu 18.04. You might have to launch the
GNOME calculator once first to create the snap directory hierarchy, I'm not
sure.

  return syscall(__NR_ioctl, fd, nr, arg);
}

  int res;
  char pushmeback = '#';
  res = ioctl64(0, TIOCSTI, &pushmeback);
  printf("normal TIOCSTI: %d (%m)\n", res);
  res = ioctl64(0, TIOCSTI | (1UL<<32), &pushmeback);
  printf("high-bit-set TIOCSTI: %d (%m)\n", res);
}

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-3917-1: snapd vulnerability

21 March 2019

An intended access restriction in snapd could be bypassed by strict mode
snaps on 64 bit architectures.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [snapd](/security/cves?package=snapd) - Daemon and tooling that enable snap packages

## Details

The snapd default seccomp filter for strict mode snaps blocks the use of

the ioctl() system call when used with TIOCSTI as the second argument to

the system call. Jann Horn discovered that this restriction could be

circumvented on 64 bit architectures. A malicious snap could exploit this

to bypass intended access restrictions to insert characters into the

terminal's input queue. On Ubuntu, snapd typically will have already

automatically refreshed itself to snapd 2.37.4 which is unaffected.

### Reduce your security exposure

  [2.37.4+18.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.37.4%2B18.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.37.4+18.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.37.4%2B18.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.37.4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.37.4ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [snapd](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd)
  -
  [2.37.4~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/snapd/2.37.4~14.04.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

### Bug Description

snap uses a seccomp filter to prevent the use of the TIOCSTI ioctl; in the

source code, this filter is expressed as follows:

# TIOCSTI allows for faking input (man tty\_ioctl)

  # TODO: this should be scaled back even more

  ioctl - !TIOCSTI

In the X86-64 version of the compiled seccomp filter, this results in the

following BPF bytecode:

[...]

  0139 if nr == 0x00000010: [true +0, false +3]

  013b if args[1].high != 0x00000000: [true +205, false +0] -> ret ALLOW (syscalls: ioctl)

  0299 if args[1].low == 0x00005412: [true +111, false +112] -> ret ERRNO

  030a ret ALLOW (syscalls: ioctl)

  [...]

This bytecode performs a 64-bit comparison; however, the syscall entry point for

ioctl() is defined with a 32-bit command argument in the kernel:

SYSCALL\_DEFINE3(ioctl, unsigned int, fd, unsigned int, cmd, unsigned long, arg)

{

  return ksys\_ioctl(fd, cmd, arg);

}

This means that setting a bit in the high half of the command parameter will

circumvent the seccomp filter while being ignored by the kernel.

This can be tested as follows on Ubuntu 18.04. You might have to launch the

GNOME calculator once first to create the snap directory hierarchy, I'm not

sure.

  errno = 0;

  return syscall(\_\_NR\_ioctl, fd, nr, arg);

}

int main(void) {

  int res;

  char pushmeback = '#';

  res = ioctl64(0, TIOCSTI, &pushmeback);

  printf("normal TIOCSTI: %d (%m)\n", res);

  res = ioctl64(0, TIOCSTI | (1UL<<32), &pushmeback);

  printf("high-bit-set TIOCSTI: %d (%m)\n", res);

}

This is fixed in 2.37.4, once it is published everywhere (pending on Ubuntu at this time) the bug can become public.

To expand on Zygmunt's comment:

The default seccomp filter in is configured to block ioctl(..., TIOCSTI, ...) but in snapd < 2.37.4 this could be circumvented on 64 bit architectures by setting any high bits in the 2nd argument to ioctl. This was caused in part because the Linux kernel ignores the high bits when processing the ioctl but considers them when evaluating the seccomp filter. This is arguably a kernel bug in that the kernel is not performing the seccomp filter check on the value that it is ultimately going to process.

This was further complicated by the fact that the tty\_ioctl man page (which is the one that documents TIOCSTI) lists the ioctl second argument as an int while the ioctl man page lists it as unsigned long.

In terms of Ubuntu and making this bug public, due to miscoordination, 2.37.4 is going to -updates in Ubuntu first as part of the regular SRU cycle. Once that passes, we'll rebuild and publish to the security pocket, issue a USN and mark this bug public.

Other distros already have 2.37.4 except Debian. Debian buster (testing) has 2.37.2, but 2.37.4 should migrate. Debian stretch (stable) has 2.21 but it doesn't use an enforcing seccomp. Debian does have reexec so it will get an updated core/snapd snap regardless.

Regarding "This is arguably a kernel bug in that the kernel is not performing the seccomp filter check on the value that it is ultimately going to process." it should be pointed out that the seccomp man page has this to say:

"When checking values from args against a blacklist, keep in mind that arguments are often silently truncated before being processed, but after the seccomp check".

It goes on to give specific examples about syscalls with an int arg and how the full 64bits are in the seccomp data whereas the kernel will only look at the lowest 32bits, which is this bug (note, TIOCSTI is the only blacklist rule we have in snapd). The problem is that glibc and the kernel disagree on the function prototype (glibc man page says unsigned long and the kernel is considering it an int) and snapd got caught up in the discrepancy.

So, there is a known kernel limitation for when the time of check of the seccomp data is done and the ignored high bits are sent off to ioctl(), the kernel treats the 2nd arg of ioctl() as an int, the int limitation is documented in the libseccomp man page and there is a man page for ioctl that says the 2nd arg is an unsigned long. Ideally the kernel and glibc would align on this point, the kernel would lift this limitation or at least libseccomp would provide more assistance for dealing with this limitation.

All distributions but Ubuntu are now on 2.37.4, once that one is migrated to stable / updates we can make this issue public.
