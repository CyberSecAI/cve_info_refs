{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The seccomp filter used by snapd to prevent the use of the TIOCSTI ioctl used a 64-bit comparison while the syscall entry point for ioctl() in the kernel uses a 32-bit command argument. Setting a bit in the high half of the command parameter would bypass the seccomp filter while being ignored by the kernel.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper seccomp filter implementation",
    "Mismatch between seccomp filter comparison and kernel ioctl command argument size"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious snap could bypass intended access restrictions and inject characters into the terminal's input queue.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious snap application can call the ioctl syscall with the TIOCSTI command with a high bit set in the command argument.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious snap application on a vulnerable system."
