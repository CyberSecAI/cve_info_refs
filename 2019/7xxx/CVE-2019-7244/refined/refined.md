```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `kerneld.sys` driver in AIDA64 exposes the `wrmsr` instruction to user-mode callers without properly validating the target Model Specific Register (MSR).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper access control to MSRs",
    "Lack of validation of the target MSR before allowing modification via `wrmsr` instruction",
    "Exposure of privileged instruction (`wrmsr`) to user mode callers."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary Ring 0 code execution, leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "User-mode application interacting with the vulnerable driver via IOCTL 0x80112084.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to either load the vulnerable driver or have administrator rights to interact with the driver. Newer versions require admin callers."
