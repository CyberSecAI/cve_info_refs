Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Affected Product:** MyWebSQL

**Affected Version:** 3.7

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization when backing up a database. A malicious user can inject PHP code into a database table, then use the "Backup Database" function to export that table data to a PHP file with an arbitrary file name, resulting in remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - **Lack of input sanitization:**  The application does not properly sanitize the data within the database table before exporting it.
   - **Arbitrary file creation:**  The "Backup Database" function allows the user to specify the filename for the backup. Combined with lack of sanitization, this allows the user to create arbitrary PHP files in a publicly accessible location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting a malicious database entry and exporting it as a PHP file. This allows them to perform unauthorized actions, potentially gaining full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
    -  **Database injection:** Injecting malicious PHP code into a database table using SQL injection or through direct database access.
    - **Database Backup:**  Using the vulnerable "Backup Database" function to export a file with PHP code.
    - **Web access:** Accessing the created PHP file with a web browser to trigger the injected code

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Access to the database:** The attacker needs access to the target database, which may be achieved through SQL Injection or direct database access using stolen credentials.
    - **Access to the vulnerable MyWebSQL application:** The attacker must have access to the MyWebSQL web application interface to use the backup functionality.
    - **Knowledge of the path to the generated backup files:**  The attacker needs to know or guess the path to where the PHP file is saved to trigger the injected command.

**Detailed Steps:**
1.  Create a table in the database.
2.  Insert a PHP shell into that table, e.g. `<?php system($_GET[cmd]); ?>`
3. Use the "Backup Database" feature to back up the database into a file with a .php extension e.g. `shell.php`.
4.  Access the generated PHP file with the desired command through the `cmd` parameter in the url to execute code on the server, e.g., `http://<domain>/mywebsql/backups/shell.php?cmd=ipconfig`
