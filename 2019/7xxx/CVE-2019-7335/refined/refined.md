  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `log.php` view in ZoneMinder insecurely prints the `Log Message` value on the webpage without applying proper filtration, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can entice a victim to visit a non-existing view (using an XSS payload instead of a valid view). The non-existing view will be reflected back in the logs, thereby triggering the XSS payload.",
    "attack_vector": "By crafting a URL with a malicious XSS payload in the `view` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the logs page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and entice a victim to visit it. The victim must be a user of the ZoneMinder application who has access to view the logs."
