- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect access control in the `/bin/goahead` binary of the D-Link DIR-823G router. Specifically, the HNAP API `SetWanSettings` does not require authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for the `SetWanSettings` API endpoint which allows unauthorized remote access to modify DNS settings of the router.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can hijack DNS settings of the router, potentially redirecting all clients connected to the WLAN to malicious servers. This allows for various attacks such as phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacker sends an HTTP POST request to the `SetWanSettings` HNAP API with the desired DNS server IP address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request to the router's web interface. No authentication is required for this request to be successful.
