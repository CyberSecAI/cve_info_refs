- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure library loading (DLL hijacking).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software loads libraries in an insecure manner, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could place a malicious DLL with the same name as a legitimate one in a location where the vulnerable application searches for libraries. When the application attempts to load the legitimate DLL, it could load the malicious one instead.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have write access to a location where the vulnerable application searches for libraries or be able to influence where the application searches for libraries.
