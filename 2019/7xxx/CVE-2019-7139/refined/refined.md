- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of SQL conditions, specifically when using 'from' and 'to' conditions in conjunction, within the `prepareSqlCondition` method of `Magento\Framework\DB\Adapter\Pdo\Mysql`. The code reuses the query generated for the 'from' condition when formatting the 'to' condition, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: SQL Injection. The `_prepareQuotedSqlCondition` method replaces every `?` character in the SQL query with the quoted value, leading to unexpected behavior when the 'from' value contains a `?` character.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, enabling them to read sensitive data from the database, such as admin sessions and password hashes. This can lead to complete compromise of the Magento instance.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting specific requests to the `/catalog/product_frontend_action/synchronize` endpoint with malicious values in the `ids` parameter, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Magento instance. The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no prior access is required.
