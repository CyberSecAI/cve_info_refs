```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of logged-in users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions they did not intend, such as deleting a database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker creates a malicious HTML page (MyWebSQL_CSRF_PoC.html) that, when visited by a logged-in user, sends a forged request to the MyWebSQL server to delete a database. This is often facilitated by an iframe (MyWebSQL_PoC_iframe.html).",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create a webpage that a logged in user will visit. The attacker also needs to know the necessary parameters to forge the request, such as the database name."
