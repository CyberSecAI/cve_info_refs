- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure library loading (DLL hijacking).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application loads libraries in an insecure manner, making it susceptible to DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could place a malicious DLL with the same name as one that the application attempts to load, in a location where the application will find it first.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to write files to a location that the application searches for DLLs.
