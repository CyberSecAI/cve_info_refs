Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input when rendering mathematical formulas inline within the Typora application. The application fails to sanitize the input, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application through the inline math formula rendering.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected JavaScript code can be leveraged to achieve Remote Code Execution by spawning a new process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by injecting malicious JavaScript.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system, allowing the attacker to gain control, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Markdown:** The attacker crafts a markdown document containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within an inline mathematical formula.
*   **Opening the Malicious Document:** The victim opens the malicious markdown document using the vulnerable Typora application, triggering the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create and distribute markdown documents:** The attacker needs the ability to create a markdown document with the malicious code injected within the math formula.
*   **Social Engineering (Optional):**  The attacker could also employ social engineering techniques to trick the user into opening the malicious markdown document with the vulnerable application

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability using an `<iframe>` tag with a `javascript:` URI, which bypasses the security measures that were implemented for math formula block rendering.
*   The JavaScript code uses `eval(atob(...))` to decode a base64 encoded string.
*   The decoded string contains code that spawns a new process using `window.parent.top.process.binding('process_wrap').Process`, and executes `cmd.exe /k calc` on Windows systems.

**Additional Information:**

*   This issue is a bypass of a previous fix, which addressed the vulnerability when rendering mathematical formula in block, not inline.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Typora version 0.9.64.
