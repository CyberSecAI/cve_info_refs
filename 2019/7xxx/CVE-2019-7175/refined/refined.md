Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7175:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided information from multiple sources, including SUSE, Debian, and GitHub, clearly indicates that the content is related to CVE-2019-7175. The official description from MITRE is a heap-based buffer overflow in the function `WriteXWDImage` of coders/xwd.c, which aligns with the Suse vulnerability report and the GitHub commit description regarding the issue.

**2. Extracted vulnerability information:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in `WriteXWDImage` function within the `coders/xwd.c` file of ImageMagick. Additionally there are memory leaks in `DecodeImage` function in `coders/pcd.c`.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Heap-based buffer overflow: A buffer is allocated on the heap, and an attempt to write beyond the allocated size causes the overflow.
    *   Memory leaks: Memory is allocated but not properly freed, resulting in memory leaks. 
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting the buffer overflow or memory leaks can lead to application crashes and resource exhaustion, causing a denial of service.
    *   Information disclosure: In the case of buffer over-read, sensitive information could be disclosed.
    *   Possible code execution: Although not explicitly confirmed in the given content, the possibility of arbitrary code execution through the buffer overflow exists.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Network: Attackers can send crafted image files over the network to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   Local: A malicious file on the local system could be used to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to provide a crafted image file: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path in ImageMagick.
    *   User interaction (likely): Exploiting the vulnerability likely requires a user to open or process the malicious image file.

**3. Additional details:**

*   The SUSE information provides CVSS v2 and v3 scores from both NVD and SUSE, along with links to SUSE advisories and Bugzilla entries related to the fix.
*   The Debian security FAQ explains how they handle security issues and why they backport fixes rather than upgrading to new major versions.
*   The GitHub commit message highlights a memory leak issue in `coders/pcd.c` in the DecodeImage function, specifically when the allocated memory is not freed on an exception. 
*   The openSUSE mailing list provides security updates related to the vulnerability.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice provides a high-level explanation of the vulnerability and its potential impact.

**4. Summary**

CVE-2019-7175 is a vulnerability in ImageMagick which is present in the  `WriteXWDImage` function in `coders/xwd.c` and memory leak issue with the `DecodeImage` function in `coders/pcd.c`. Attackers can trigger the vulnerabilities via crafted images, potentially leading to DoS, information disclosure and possibly code execution. The vulnerability is rated as having moderate severity, but the impact is considered local in some security reports and there is a requirement of user interaction.
