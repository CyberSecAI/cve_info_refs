Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing JOBOPTIONS files in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, the program does not check the size of the input before copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* Stack-based buffer overflow: Due to the insufficient validation of user-provided data, an attacker can provide an oversized input, causing the program to write beyond the boundaries of the stack-based buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This allows the attacker to potentially take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The primary attack vector is through a malicious JOBOPTIONS file.
* User interaction is required: the user must either open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JOBOPTIONS file with an oversized input designed to overflow the buffer.
* The attacker needs to entice the user to open the malicious file or visit a webpage that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerability affects Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
* Adobe has released updates to address this issue.
* The vulnerability is classified as critical and has a CVSS score of 7.0 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
