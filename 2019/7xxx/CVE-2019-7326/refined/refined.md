CVE-2019-7326: Self - Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in console.php in ZoneMinder v1.33.1

- Root cause: The application insecurely prints the `Host` value on the webpage, without proper filtration/escaping.
- Weakness: Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of proper output sanitization.
- Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vector:
  1. Inject the XSS payload into the `Host Name` field via the monitor source configuration page.
  2. Navigate to the affected URL (console.php) to trigger the payload.
- Required attacker capabilities: Ability to modify the `Host Name` field (likely requires authentication and authorization to modify monitor settings).
