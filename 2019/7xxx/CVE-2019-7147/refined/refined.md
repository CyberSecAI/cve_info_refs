- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A global-buffer-overflow in the `crc64ib` function within `crc64.c` due to incorrect type casting. Specifically, the `nasm_tolower` function, which is used to modify input for CRC calculation, had a `char` return type when it should have been `unsigned char`. This caused sign extension issues when used to index the `crc64_tab` array, leading to out-of-bounds access.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Global buffer overflow. The use of `char` instead of `unsigned char` in `nasm_tolower` leads to out-of-bounds reads.

- **Impact of exploitation:** A crafted input can cause segment faults, resulting in a crash.

- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted input provided to the NASM assembler via the command line using the `-f bin` option. E.g. `./nasm -f bin $POC -o /dev/null`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input to the NASM assembler.
