Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the handling of TIF files in Adobe Bridge CC. This lack of validation allows for a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write, meaning the software attempts to write data to a memory location that is not part of the allocated buffer. This can corrupt memory and lead to other issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker can gain control of the user's machine and perform actions with the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIF File:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted TIF file. If a user opens this malicious file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Bridge CC, the out-of-bounds write is triggered.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** The vulnerability can also be exploited via a malicious page that somehow causes the vulnerable application to parse a crafted TIF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The victim must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious TIF file.
*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered by parsing a malicious file, which can be delivered through various means.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   Adobe has released an update (version 9.0.3) to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Critical" due to the remote code execution impact.
*   The vulnerability exists in Adobe Bridge CC versions 9.0.2 and earlier.

In summary, CVE-2019-7132 is a critical vulnerability in Adobe Bridge CC caused by improper handling of TIF files, allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution via a crafted TIF file or malicious web page. User interaction is needed to trigger this vulnerability.
