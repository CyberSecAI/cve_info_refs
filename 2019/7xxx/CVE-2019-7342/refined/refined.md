Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7342
*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Location:** `filter.php` in ZoneMinder
*   **Root Cause:** The `filter` view insecurely displays the `filter[AutoExecuteCmd]` parameter value without proper output filtering/escaping.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker crafts a malicious URL with a JavaScript payload in the `filter[AutoExecuteCmd]` parameter.
    *   The victim visits the URL, the server reflects the payload back in the response.
    *   The victim's browser executes the malicious script.
*   **Payload Example:** `"><img src=x onerror=prompt('1');>`
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement
    *   Other malicious actions
*   **Affected Version:** ZoneMinder v1.33.1
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that will be visited by a user of the ZoneMinder application. This could be achieved through social engineering or other means of URL distribution.
*   **Mitigation:** Proper escaping of special characters in the `filter[AutoExecuteCmd]` parameter when displaying it in the `filter` view.
