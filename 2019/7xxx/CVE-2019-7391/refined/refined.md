Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Zyxel VMG3312-B10B and DSL-491HNU-B1B v2 modems are vulnerable to CSRF.
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) shows a form that can be submitted from a different origin (than the target modem), and which the modem will process, as if submitted from its own webpage.
-  The form includes hardcoded credentials ("admin" and "1234"), which are likely default credentials for the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially execute actions on the vulnerable modem without the user's consent.
- The provided PoC targets the login page, but other actions, such as changing settings, are possibly exploitable.
- If default credentials are used, an attacker could gain full control of the device by logging in.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious webpage or link.
- An attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a crafted webpage containing the malicious form.
- When the user visits the webpage and the form is automatically submitted, the modem executes the action specified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious webpage.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into visiting the malicious webpage while being logged into the modem.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses hardcoded credentials, which suggests that this particular PoC is only exploitable on devices which have not changed default admin password.
- The provided information gives more detail than a basic CVE description. It contains a full PoC of the CSRF vulnerability, including the necessary HTML code.
