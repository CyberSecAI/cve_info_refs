Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-7639:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `gsi-openssh` handles the `PermitPAMUserChange` option in the `sshd_config` file. Specifically, when `PermitPAMUserChange` is enabled, the `sshpam_check_userchanged()` function incorrectly overwrites the result of the initial PAM authentication with a success value. This happens even if the initial authentication using `pam_authenticate()` failed due to an incorrect password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect PAM Result Handling:** The primary vulnerability is that the `sshpam_check_userchanged()` function modifies the `sshpam_err` variable, which was previously set by `pam_authenticate()`, effectively masking the authentication failure.
*   **Bypass of Authentication:** By enabling `PermitPAMUserChange`, an attacker can bypass password authentication, leading to unauthorized access if they provide the correct username along with an incorrect password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a system by logging in with a valid username but an incorrect password.
*   **System Compromise:** Once logged in, an attacker can potentially execute malicious commands, escalate privileges, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the SSH service running on the target system.
*   **SSH Login:** The attack is carried out through the standard SSH login process, but providing an incorrect password for a valid user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the target system via SSH.
*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs to know a valid username on the target system.
*   **`PermitPAMUserChange` Enabled:**  The vulnerable system must have the `PermitPAMUserChange` option set to `yes` in the `/etc/gsissh/sshd_config` file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in `gsi-openssh` versions 7.8p1 and 7.9p1 (specifically versions prior to `gsi-openssh-7.9p1-5.fc30`, `gsi-openssh-7.8p1-3.fc28` and  `gsi-openssh-7.9p1-5.fc29`).
*   The issue was resolved by correcting the logic in the `sshpam_check_userchanged()` function.
*   The bug report indicates that this vulnerability was introduced between version 7.7p1 and 7.8p1 of `gsi-openssh`.
