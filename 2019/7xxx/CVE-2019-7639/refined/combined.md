| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1673802#c0)  viraniac    2019-02-08 07:52:43 UTC  ``` Description of problem: If PermitPAMUserChange is set to yes in the sshd_config for gsi-openssh-server, anyone is allowed to login to the system with existing user even if they provide incorrect password  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 7.9p1-3.fc29   How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install gsi-openssh-server 2. Initialize rsa, ecdsa, ed25519 keys for gsi-openssh server using gsissh-keygen 2. Set PermitPAMUserChange to yes in /etc/gsissh/sshd_config 3. Run /usr/sbin/gsisshd 4. Try to connect to the system using Putty with user "root" and some incorrect password like "test1234" (The actual password for root on the test system was root1234)  Actual results: User gets logged in even though there is a failure entry in /var/log/messages for user authentication   Expected results: User should not be able to login unless he provides the correct password  Additional info: This use to work fine on 7.7p1. I haven't tested the 7.8p1 but its possible that earlier versions might also be vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1673802#c1)  viraniac    2019-02-08 12:43:51 UTC  ``` I have posted a request for CVE and have got the following id for the same. [CVE-2019-7639](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-7639)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1673802#c2)  viraniac    2019-02-08 14:23:18 UTC  ``` I went through the code of openssh-7.9p1-gsissh.patch  I found the following code at line 511   	sshpam_err = pam_authenticate(sshpam_handle, flags); +	if (options.permit_pam_user_change) { +		sshpam_check_userchanged(); +	}  and then I saw the definition of sshpam_check_userchanged() function and I noticed that its also using the same variable "sshpam_err" to check if the user that we want to map to exists.  But because of that, it changes sshpam_err to say that the operation was a success. The code present on line 515 onward interpret it as authentication was successful and user ends up logging into the system with incorrect password.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1673802#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-02-08 21:39:55 UTC  ``` gsi-openssh-7.9p1-5.fc29 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-af3d726d38>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1673802#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-02-08 21:41:07 UTC  ``` gsi-openssh-7.8p1-3.fc28 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 28. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-710afd062a>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1673802#c5)  Mattias Ellert    2019-02-08 23:02:05 UTC  ``` + not affected - affected  + gsi-openssh-7.7p1-5.fc28 - gsi-openssh-7.8p1-1.fc28 - gsi-openssh-7.8p1-2.fc28 + gsi-openssh-7.8p1-3.fc28  + gsi-openssh-7.7p1-5.fc29 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-1.fc29 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-2.fc29 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-3.fc29 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-4.fc29 + gsi-openssh-7.9p1-5.fc29  + gsi-openssh-7.7p1-5.fc30 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-1.fc30 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-2.fc30 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-2.fc30.1 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-3.fc30-  - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-3.fc30.1 - gsi-openssh-7.9p1-4.fc30 + gsi-openssh-7.9p1-5.fc30   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1673802#c6)  Fedora Update System    2019-02-10 01:50:55 UTC  ``` gsi-openssh-7.8p1-3.fc28 has been pushed to the Fedora 28 testing repository.
