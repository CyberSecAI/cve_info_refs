- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the "Title" field of the Main Menu before rendering it in the HTML output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores the malicious payload in the database and executes it when the page is rendered.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application that will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can inject malicious code through the "Title" field in the Main Menu editing page, accessible via the admin interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable menu edit functionality.
