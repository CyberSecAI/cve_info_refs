| Bulletin ID | Date Published | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| APSB19-10 | February 12, 2019 | 2 |

### Summary

Adobe has released security updates for ColdFusion versions 2018, 2016 and 11. These updates resolve [critical](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) and [important](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Affected Versions

| --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion 2018 | Update 1 and earlier versions | All |
| ColdFusion 2016 | Update 7 and earlier versions | All |
| ColdFusion 11 | Update 15 and earlier versions | All |

### Solution

Adobe categorizes these updates with the following [priority rating](/security/severity-ratings.html) and recommends users update their installations to the newest versions:

| **Product** | **Updated Version** | **Platform** | **Priority rating** | **Availability** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion 2018 | Update 2 | All | 2 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2018-update-2.html) |
| ColdFusion 2016 | Update 8 | All | 2 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2016-update-8.html) |
| ColdFusion 11 | Update 16 | All | 2 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-11-update-16.html) |

Note:

The security updates referenced in the above Tech Notes require JDK 8u121 or higher (for ColdFusion 2016) and JDK 7u131 or JDK 8u121 (for ColdFusion 11). Adobe recommends updating your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. Applying the ColdFusion update without a corresponding JDK update will NOT secure the server.  See the relevant Tech Notes for more details.

Adobe also recommends customers apply the security configuration settings as outlined on the ColdFusion Security page as well as review the respective Lockdown guides.

### ColdFusion JDK Requirement

**COLDFUSION 2018 HF1**

**For Application Servers**

On JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

Apache Tomcat Application Server: edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

WebLogic Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

WildFly/EAP Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation.

**COLDFUSION 2016 HF7**

This security update requires ColdFusion to be on JDK 8u121 or higher.   Adobe recommends that you must manually update your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. In case you do not update the JDK/JRE, simply applying the update would NOT secure the server.

**For Application Servers**

Additionally, on JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

On Apache Tomcat Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

On WebLogic Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

On a WildFly/EAP Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation

**COLDFUSION 11 HF15**

This security update requires ColdFusion to be on JDK 7u131 or JDK 8u121 or higher.   Adobe recommends that you must manually update your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. In case you do not update the JDK/JRE, simply applying the update would NOT secure the server.

**For Application Servers**

Additionally, on J2EE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

On Apache Tomcat Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

On WebLogic Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

On a WildFly/EAP Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation
