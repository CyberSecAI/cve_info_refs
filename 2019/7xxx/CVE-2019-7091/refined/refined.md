Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the **deserialization of untrusted data** within Adobe ColdFusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The application processes serialized data from an untrusted source without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through a specially crafted serialized object.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The ColdFusion application does not adequately validate the incoming serialized data before deserializing it, leading to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable ColdFusion instance. This could lead to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the submission of a crafted serialized data stream to the vulnerable ColdFusion server. The specific method of delivery isn't specified in detail but it would likely involve sending this data via network requests.
- The content mentions that a JVM flag needs to be set for application server installations, which would mean that this vulnerability is likely present in a Java based component of ColdFusion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send data to a network accessible ColdFusion server.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized object that when deserialized would trigger arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information indicates that this vulnerability is considered **critical**.
- The vulnerability affects ColdFusion versions 2018 (Update 1 and earlier), 2016 (Update 7 and earlier), and 11 (Update 15 and earlier).
- The fix for this vulnerability involves updating to the latest version of ColdFusion, along with updating the JDK/JRE to specific versions (8u121 or higher for 2016, and 7u131 or 8u121 or higher for 11). It also requires setting a JVM flag `-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.*;!com.sun.syndication.*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.*` on J2EE application servers.
