- **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability in the "Title" field of Blocks in Croogo version v3.0.5.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of proper escaping of the "Title" field value before printing it on the Blocks page.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src=xss onerror=alert("search")>`) into the "Title" field when editing a Block.
- **Impact:** When an administrator visits the Blocks page, the injected XSS payload will be executed in their browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the administrator, such as stealing cookies or injecting malicious content into the page.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit Blocks, which typically requires administrative privileges or the ability to trick an administrator into editing a block with a malicious title.
