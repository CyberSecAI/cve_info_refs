{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `dogetsql` function in `/app/system/databack/admin/index.class.php`. The function processes user-provided input (`tables`) without proper sanitization and uses it to generate content for a PHP file via the `docache_write` function. Although the created file is deleted, a race condition can be exploited to execute the code before deletion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unsanitized user input used to create a PHP file.",
    "Race condition vulnerability during file creation and deletion."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to a web shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `dogetsql` endpoint and exploiting a race condition.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make authenticated requests to the MetInfo admin panel and send a specially crafted request to the `dogetsql` function, while also being able to access the generated file path."
