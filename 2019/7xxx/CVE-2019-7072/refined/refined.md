*   **Malicious Page:** The vulnerability can also be exploited if the user visits a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file or lure the user to a malicious web page.
*   User interaction is required, meaning the user must open the malicious file or visit the malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is rated as a **Critical** severity by Adobe
*   Adobe has released updates to address this vulnerability.
