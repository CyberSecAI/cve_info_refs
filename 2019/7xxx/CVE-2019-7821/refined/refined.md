Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2019-7821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to a use-after-free error within the parsing of images within PostScript files in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. The vulnerability occurs because of a lack of validation of the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free vulnerability. Specifically related to how Adobe Acrobat Pro DC processes PostScript files. The software attempts to use an object in memory after it has been freed, which can cause a crash or enable arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability can be exploited to potentially disclose sensitive information.
-  Arbitrary Code Execution (in conjunction with other vulnerabilities): It can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by getting the target user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
-The specific attack vector is within the parsing of images within PostScript files

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious PostScript file that contains a specifically formatted image that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC or redirect the user to a malicious website containing the file.
- User interaction is required.
