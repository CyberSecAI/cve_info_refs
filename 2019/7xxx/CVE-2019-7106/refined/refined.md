Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-7106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal: The software is susceptible to path traversal attacks. This means an attacker could potentially manipulate file paths to access or modify files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This would give the attacker significant control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but it implies the vulnerability is triggered by manipulating file paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to manipulate the file paths used by the application to exploit this vulnerability. The specific method of manipulation is not detailed.
- The attacker would need to target a system running a vulnerable version of Adobe XD.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical."
- The affected versions are Adobe XD version 16.0 and earlier on macOS.
- The vulnerability was reported by Zhongcheng Li(CK01) of Topsec Alpha Team.
- The fix is to update to version 17.0.12 or later.
- This bulletin also mentions CVE-2019-7105 which is also a path traversal leading to arbitrary code execution.
