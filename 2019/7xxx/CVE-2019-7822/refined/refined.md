Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-7822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the parsing of charstring definitions in PostScript files by Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. Specifically, crafted data within a PostScript file can trigger a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Write:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, where the software attempts to write data to a memory location outside the designated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, allowing the attacker to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by tricking a user into opening a malicious file, or visiting a malicious page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker can embed the crafted PostScript data within a malicious file, such as a PDF document, which, when opened by a user, triggers the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Page:** The vulnerability can also be triggered by a user visiting a malicious webpage that utilizes the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The target user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page that contains the exploit.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious PostScript Data:** The attacker needs the capability to create a PostScript file with the specific crafted data to trigger the out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Esteban Ruiz (mr_me) of Source Incite, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.8.
