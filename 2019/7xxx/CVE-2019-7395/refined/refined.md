{
  "CVE-2019-7395": {
    "Description": "In ImageMagick before 7.0.8-25, a memory leak exists in WritePSDChannel in coders/psd.c.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory leak exists in the `WritePSDChannel` function within the `coders/psd.c` file of ImageMagick. The function allocates memory for `compressed_pixels` at line 2770, but if the `deflateInit` at line 2782 fails, the allocated memory is not freed when the function returns at line 2785, leading to a memory leak.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could cause a denial of service by repeatedly triggering the memory leak, eventually exhausting available memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted PSD image file that when processed by ImageMagick will result in memory allocation without releasing it, causing a memory leak.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PSD file to a user or system which uses the vulnerable ImageMagick version to process image files. The attacker does not need local access or any special privileges."
