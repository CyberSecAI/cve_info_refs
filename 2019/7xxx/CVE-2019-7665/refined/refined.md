Guideline 1:

The content contains information about CVE-2019-7665 and other CVEs, specifically detailing a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in elfutils.

Guideline 4:

- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - A heap-based buffer over-read in the `elf32_xlatetom` function within `elf32_xlatetom.c` in libelf. This function is used for cross-endian conversion of ELF data structures. The vulnerability occurs when a malformed ELF note header (specifically NT_PLATFORM notes with a non-zero terminated string) is not correctly handled.
    - In `check_symtab_shndx` function in `elflint.c`, a crafted ELF file leads to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash.
    - In `ebl_object_note_type_name` function in `eblobjnotetypename.c`, a crafted ELF file leads to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Heap-based buffer over-read: Reading beyond the allocated memory region on the heap.
    - Denial of Service (DoS): Caused by application crashes due to the buffer over-read.
    - Improper input validation of note headers, specifically `NT_PLATFORM` notes.

- Impact of exploitation:
    - Application crash, leading to a denial of service.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution if the over-read can be further exploited.

- Attack vectors:
    - By providing a crafted ELF file, especially a malformed core file.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to provide the crafted ELF file as input to elfutils tools (e.g., eu-readelf, eu-elflint). This is usually a local attacker scenario, although remote attack is listed as possible in some sources.
    - No special privileges are needed.

Additional Details:
- The vulnerability is in elfutils, a library/utilities package used to manipulate ELF objects.
- The vulnerability is specifically triggered in functions responsible for processing ELF files, specifically note headers and symbol tables
- The `elf32_xlatetom` function is used for cross-endian conversion
- Patches for the vulnerability include checking for null termination in string data within ELF headers and checking boundary conditions.
- SUSE considers elfutils a developer tool and recommends against processing untrusted ELF files with it.
