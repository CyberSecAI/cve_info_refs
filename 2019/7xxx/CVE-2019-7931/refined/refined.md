- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure library loading (DLL hijacking).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to DLL hijacking, which allows an attacker to load a malicious DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application loads a DLL, allowing an attacker to replace legitimate DLLs with malicious ones.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will load it instead of the legitimate one.
