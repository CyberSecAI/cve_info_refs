Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `adamrob-parallax-scroll` plugin before version 2.1 for WordPress was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of the post title.
*   The plugin used `get_the_title()` directly without proper escaping when generating the output for the parallax effect shortcode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code injected into the post title is executed within the context of the user's browser when the page containing the parallax effect is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a post title.
*   When a user views a page or post that uses the vulnerable shortcode, this JavaScript would execute in their browser.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Admin account takeover

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the WordPress post title field in the plugin's custom post type.
*   An attacker, with the ability to create or edit posts, injects malicious JavaScript code within the post title.
*   This malicious payload is stored in the database.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a page that uses the plugin's shortcode, and the title is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit WordPress posts (e.g., Contributor or higher role), or have access to an account that can do so.
*   No special network position is required; the attack is performed through the WordPress backend.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**

*   The vulnerability was present in the `includes/adamrob-parralax-shortcode.php` file.
*   The fix involved adding filters to title text so it is escaped correctly preventing XSS attacks, using `esc_html` and `wp_strip_all_tags`.
*   The vulnerable code used `get_the_title()` directly, while the corrected code uses `$TheTitle = esc_html(wp_strip_all_tags(get_the_title(),true))` to sanitize the output.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1 of the plugin.
*   The Metamorfosec advisory provides a proof of concept showing exactly how to exploit the vulnerability.
