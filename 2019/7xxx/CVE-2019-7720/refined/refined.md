- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of user-supplied input during the installation process when writing to the configuration file (`config.php`). Specifically, the `$_POST['db_name']` parameter is used to modify the `DB_NAME` constant within the `config.php` file using string replacement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Code injection vulnerability in the `install.php` file. The script uses `str_replace` to modify the configuration file based on user input without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into the `config.php` file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can grant the attacker a web shell, allowing for complete control over the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited during the installation process via a crafted POST request to `/install.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to make HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application, meaning they should be able to access the server on which the application is being installed. They must be able to submit crafted POST parameters during the installation.
