- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Markdown rendering of release notes and commit messages displays confidential issue titles, MR titles, and milestone titles as tooltips to guest users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure through tooltips. Guest users should not be able to view confidential titles.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information (issue titles, MR titles, and milestone titles) to guest users.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the releases section of a GitLab project as a guest user. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by hovering over the markdown-rendered text, revealing the confidential information in tooltips.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a guest user of the GitLab project.
