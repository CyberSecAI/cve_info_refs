Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PostScript files within Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary weakness is the ability to read memory beyond the allocated buffer due to improper input validation during PostScript file parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to disclose sensitive information by reading from memory outside of the intended buffer.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although this vulnerability by itself is rated for information disclosure, the advisory states it could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted malicious PostScript file.
*  **Malicious Page:** A user could also be exploited by visiting a malicious page that contains malicious PostScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered by a file or malicious page opened by the target.
*   **User Interaction:** The exploit requires user interaction, specifically by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious web page.
