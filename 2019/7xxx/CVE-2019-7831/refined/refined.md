## Analysis of CVE-2019-7831

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7831:

**CVE Description:** A use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC that can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the undocumented `FormWorkflow.setFormFolderForMultipleForms` function with an `app.thermometer` GUI element within a PDF's embedded JavaScript.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** A specific sequence of JavaScript code triggers the allocation, freeing, and subsequent reuse of a freed object. The `FormWorkflow.setFormFolderForMultipleForms` function, when called with `app.thermometer`, allocates an object. A subsequent action (specifically, `getField('txt1').signatureGetModifications(app.media.windowType)`) frees this object. Accessing `app.thermometer` after the object has been freed results in a use-after-free condition.

**Attack Vector:**
1.  **Malicious PDF:** An attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within a PDF file.
2.  **User Interaction:** The victim opens the malicious PDF file in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.
3.  **Code Execution:** The JavaScript code executes, triggering the use-after-free vulnerability. Through memory manipulation, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.
4.  **Malicious Web Page:** A user could also be tricked into visiting a malicious web page hosting the specially crafted PDF.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This could lead to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The use-after-free vulnerability can corrupt memory, potentially leading to application crashes or unpredictable behavior.

**Required Capabilities:**
*   **Crafting a Malicious PDF:** The attacker needs the ability to create a PDF file with embedded JavaScript code that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious webpage hosting the PDF.
