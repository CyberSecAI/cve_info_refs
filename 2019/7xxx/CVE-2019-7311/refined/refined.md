Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7311:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Linksys WRT 1300 ACS router's administrative interface does not enforce HTTPS by default, meaning communication between the user and the router during administrative tasks is unencrypted.
*   The router uses Base64 encoding, instead of proper encryption, to "hash" the username and password. Base64 is easily reversible and does not provide any real security.
*   The router sends the Base64 encoded username and password within a cookie with almost every transaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Encryption:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of HTTPS, leaving credentials exposed.
*   **Weak Hashing:**  Using Base64 as a form of hashing is a severe weakness as it is easily reversible. This means an attacker can easily decode the credentials.
*   **Credential Exposure:** The username and password are sent with almost every request in an easily decoded format, increasing exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who can sniff network traffic or gains access to a user's computer after the user logs in to the router's admin interface can obtain the administrative password.
*   With admin access, the attacker can take complete control of the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** Attackers on the same network can use tools like Wireshark to capture network traffic and extract the Base64 encoded credentials.
*   **Compromised Client:** An attacker who gains access to a user's computer after the user logs into the router's interface can extract the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable router or have access to the user's computer.
*   The attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic or have the ability to extract cookies from the user's computer (if accessed after login).
*   Basic understanding of network packet analysis and Base64 decoding is required.

**Additional Notes:**
* The blog post details the process of discovering and reporting the vulnerability, including the lack of response from the vendor prior to publication.
* The vulnerability is found in Linksys WRT 1300 ACS router.
* The discovered vulnerability does not require any sophisticated methods, just basic network analysis and Base64 decoding.
