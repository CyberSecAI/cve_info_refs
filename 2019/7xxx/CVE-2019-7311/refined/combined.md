On my way to studying from Offensive Security's OSCE exam I began to explore exploit-db.com for exploitable applications I could try to recreate. I found EasyFTP 1.0.7.11 and went about trying to own it. 1. Fuzzed using Boo-Fuzz that identified the LIST parameter as being exploitable. - I found a good Boo-Fuzz tutorial on youtube . - Note below, that i reviewed several different parameters including user, stor,retr, password and list.  Generally speaking you identify these parameters by reviewing the RFC associated with the application and reviewing a wireshark snippet while regularly interacting with the application.  (part of Boofuzz python script) (output of running BooFuzz python script) - You can see at 407 bytes the script fails to receive response from EasyFTP...i.e. it crashed .  At this point you'd want to confirm this crash by reviewing Immunity and confirm that you see the application crashed.  2. Replicated Boo-F...

So.....hell has frozen over and I've finally started a security blog.  My name Aaron aka T0b0rX0r and Robot Security is my home away from 127.0.0.1.  This blog was setup to host my tutorials, exploits, CTF walk throughs and generally my thoughts on security. I am technology professional based out of the Los Angeles region.  I've worked in information technology for 17 years and as of late been focusing on infosec.  I have a background that includes a bachlors in Computer Science from USC, a masters in technology as well as being certified as Offensive Security Certified Processional (OSCP), a Certified Information Security Professional(CISSP),  and a Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP). I'll be working to keep this site up to date with a new article once a week (atleast). I can be reached over twitter (@t0b0rx0r) and on linked-in.  I also host my code (generally exploits) on github  (http://www.github.com/t0b0rx0r) .

# My First CVE- Linksys WRT 1300 ACS- CVE-2019-7311

May 3, 2019

So having completed my OSCP this summer and studying for OSCE I wanted to begin the process of trying to find security bugs in the real world.  Obtaining a CVE and listing in the exploitdb seemed like a good start.  I decided to begin with those things in proximity to me….like my router.  Several months ago i had recently listened to a podcast (i’ll try to find the link) to a security flaw within a netgear router of similar vintage (2014?) to my own linksys.  The podcast described a crazy lack of best practices when it came to this particular netgear router.  Things like….a plain text password being located on the router, FTP being opened to the public internet, and all manner of bad things.  Things that shouldnt be a thing in the 21st century for a $200+ device that functions as the gateway of internet access for millions of internet users.  As I listed to the podcast I didn’t hear anything described too exotic from those security basics that I learned.  I thought to myself I know how to MITM, use nmap, fuzz and use burp…i should give it a shot!

![Image result for I can do that](https://editions.lib.umn.edu/electionacademy/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2012/06/I.Can_.Do_.That_.jpg)

With two weeks worth of review under the way i’ve already found a series of issues with my several hundred dollar linksys router.  Some specific areas of concerns that will become future blog entries (like unauthenticated access to router)! and some that should provide more fodder for future research (diagnostic report anyone).  For now and the topic of this blog entry is how my LinkSys WRT 1300 ACS seems to manage authentication ….or doesnt….otherwise known as CVE-2019-7311.

**The Flaw**

The flaw is basic and can be broken into 3 parts.

![](https://www.clearswift.com/sites/default/files/images/blog/blog_encryption_image.jpg)

1. The router does not default-ly use HTTPS for logging into its admin interface.  This fact means that communication between it and the user during administrative tasks are not encrypted.
3. The router uses base64 to hash the username password.  For those of you still new to security research, base64 is not encryption its simply an alternatively way to represent text.  It might as well be plain text!
5. The router seems to send the username and password (in base64) in the form of a cookie with almost every transaction.

![Image result for OMG](https://d2v9y0dukr6mq2.cloudfront.net/video/thumbnail/P3IPDsA/omg-letters-scribble-animation-doodle-4k_sb8vmstul_thumbnail-full01.png)

The design flaw can be seen by capturing the packets from your web browser to your router using something like Burp.

As can seen below, the line JNAP Authorization contains what appears to be random text (its not its base64).

![](http://54.245.20.79/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-myfirstcve-builders-1024x611.jpg)

When base64 decoded you can see the password.

***EQUALS***

***admin:notmyrealpassword***

![](http://54.245.20.79/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/blog-myfirstcve-code.jpg)

**Implications**

The implications are that if anyone is sniffing your network while you log in administratively to your router or gains immediate access to your computer after log in they will be able to acquire your admin password.

**How Did I find It?**

By having too much time on my hands and examining the login process between my computer and the router.

**The CVE Process**

* 2/1/19:Requested CVE
* 2/4/19 : Notified manufacturer of design flaw.
* 4/28/19: No Response- Published Flaw
