- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate checks on the Global Configuration helpurl settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the help URL configuration, which would then be executed when a user accesses the help functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the Global Configuration help URL setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to modify the Global Configuration settings within the Joomla! CMS. This typically means having administrator or super administrator level access.
