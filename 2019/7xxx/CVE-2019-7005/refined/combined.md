## 1. Overview:

Avaya products provide Unified, Contact Center, VoIP, Cloud and Edge communications for customers.

IP Office Platform provides a single, stackable, scalable small business communications system that grows with your business easily and cost-effectively.

A vulnerability was discovered in the web interface component of IP Office that could potentially allow an unauthenticated user to gain access to sensitive information. This issue has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (cve.mitre.org) identifier [CVE-2019-7005](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7005).

## 2. Avaya Products affected:

For assessment and severity classification details refer to Section 3 of [Avaya's Product Vulnerability Response Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100045520).
The "Resolution" column will be updated as fixes are made available. Please reference the "Information" column for any additional information regarding the affected product.

| Product: | Version(s): | Resolution: | Information: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya IP Office | 10.0 through 10.1.0.7, 11.0 through 11.0.4.2 | For 10.x, upgrade to [10.1 Service Pack 8](https://support.avaya.com/downloads/download-details.action?contentId=C20205181443595760_7&productId=P0160&releaseId=10.1.x) or later. For 11.x, upgrade to [11.0 Feature Pack 4 Service Pack 3](https://support.avaya.com/downloads/download-details.action?contentId=C20204171312282310_0&productId=P0160&releaseId=11.0.x) or later. |  |

**Recommended Actions for Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends following networking and
security best practices by implementing firewalls, ACLs,
physical security or other appropriate access restrictions.
Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in
place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network
from this potential vulnerability may be mitigated by
ensuring these practices are implemented until such time as
an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya
action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but the System Product operating system or
application should not be modified unless the change is
approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved may
void the Avaya product service contract.

### CVSS 3.0 Scoring and Metrics:

Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3
(CVSSv3) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSSv3 base score and metrics. Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSSv3 scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment. For more information on CVSS and how the score is calculated, see
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.0: Specification Document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).

| Vulnerability | CVSSv3 Base Score | CVSSv3 Metrics |
