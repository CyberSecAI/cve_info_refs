 *“A browser extension that blocks bad websites without compromising your privacy?”*

What sounds like an attempt to square the circle, actually can be done. Almost all browser extensions that aim to block harmful websites send each visited website to cloud servers that match the exact URL/address with a large database of known bad sites. That comes with the advantage of being able to filter sites very thoroughly on the URL level (different from DNS- or host-based filtering such as available in Emsisoft’s Web Protection feature), but the big downside of that approach is that the creators of such extensions can basically see all the websites you’re visiting and track you throughout all your online activities.

Our development team proves that things can be done in a better, more privacy-conscious way. Emsisoft Browser Security is a brand new extension, currently available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers that not only blocks access to websites that distribute malware, but also prevents phishing attacks that try to steal your passwords.

**How it works:**

Instead of sending each full website URL to a cloud server for matching, it only sends a calculated hash value of the domain name of each newly visited site to our servers once and then receives a list of matching patterns that are applied locally on your computer. Those patterns are then kept for successive visits of pages on the same host/domain, which not only speeds up the matching significantly, but also means that **Emsisoft doesn’t know any of the details of your browsing activity**.

**Installation of Emsisoft Browser Security**

Emsisoft Browser Security works independently of Emsisoft Anti-Malware and can be obtained free of charge from the extension stores:

[Get Emsisoft Browser Security for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emsisoft-browser-security/jfofijpkapingknllefalncmbiienkab)

[Get Emsisoft Browser Security for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/emsisoft-browser-security/)

[Get Emsisoft Browser Security for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/jlpdpddffjddlfdbllimedpemaodbjgn)

Users of alternative browsers please refer to our extended [Emsisoft Browser Security User Guide](https://www.emsisoft.com/en/help/1974/emsisoft-browser-security/) for further information.

Emsisoft Anti-Malware asks you to install the extension if it’s missing.

*Note*: If Emsisoft Browser Security is installed and active in the browser for the profile you are currently using, and you attempt to access a website or webpage that Emsisoft Browser Security thinks is bad, a notification webpage will appear and the connection will be blocked.

If both Emsisoft Browser Security and Emsisoft Anti-Malware’s Web Protection are present and enabled, Web Protection will block the connection attempt first, and show a slide-out notification on the screen. In this case, the web browser will show an error indicating the website could not be reached.

## All 2018.12 improvements in a nutshell

### [Emsisoft Anti-Malware](https://www.emsisoft.com/en/anti-malware-home/)

* Emsisoft Browser Security extension.
* Improved stability and compatibility.
* Improved vulnerability resilience.
* Improved product activation.
* Several minor tweaks and fixes.

### How to obtain the new version

As always, so long as you have auto-updates enabled in the software, you will receive the latest version automatically during your regularly scheduled updates, which are hourly by default. New users, please download the full installer from our [product pages](https://www.emsisoft.com/en/anti-malware-home/).

*Note to Enterprise users:* If you have chosen to receive “Delayed” updates in the Update settings for your clients, they will receive the new software version no earlier than 30 days after the regular “Stable” availability. This gives you time to perform internal compatibility tests before a new version gets rolled out to your clients automatically.

### Emsisoft Enterprise Security + EDR

Robust and proven endpoint security solution for organizations of all sizes. [Start free trial](https://www.emsisoft.com/en/business-security/#enterprise-security)

Have a great and well-protected day!

# Vulnerability report

* April 1, 2019
* 3 min read

Emsisoft would like to thank independent security researchers that help us to improve our products. If you have found a new vulnerability in our products that can be used to threaten the security of a computer, please immediately let us know via [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#daa9bfb9afa8b3aea39abfb7a9b3a9b5bcaef4b9b5b7).

The following vulnerabilities have been disclosed:

## 2019-01-02: ACL bypass in Emsisoft Protection Platform driver

***Description:***

EPP.sys in Emsisoft Anti-Malware versions prior to version 2018.12 allows a local attacker to bypass its ACLs because Interpreted Device Characteristics lacks FILE\_DEVICE\_SECURE\_OPEN and therefore files and directories “inside” the \\.\EPP device are not properly protected. As a result, a local attacker may be able to use functionality exposed by the driver to enumerate and read process details, they would normally not have access to.

***Affected products:***

All Emsisoft Anti-Malware versions prior to version 2018.12.

***Fix:***

The issue has been fixed in version 2018.12 and later, which was released January 2nd, 2019. Due to our rolling release model, all users received the fix automatically via their online updates and no manual intervention is required.

***Acknowledgements:***

Emsisoft would like to thank Nafiez for bringing this issue to our attention.

## 2016-01-08: Code execution and privilege escalation in installers

***Description:***

Installer packages of Emsisoft products have been found to be vulnerable to so-called carpet poisoning attacks. These allow for execution of third party code with elevated rights, in the event that the malicious code is already planted in DLL files using specific file names in the same folder where the installer packages are saved to and executed from.

***Background:***

The root cause of this issue is essentially the way in which Windows loads DLL files. While developers expect that system components are loaded from the Windows folder, Windows looks for an equally named file in the same folder of an executable (EXE) first. This allows an attacker to plant a malicious version of a DLL in the same folder (e.g. via drive-by download) to get their malicious code executed with higher rights when the installer for the legitimate software is executed. Since installers require elevated rights, they pass on these rights to any other code they load, such as code in DLL files, allowing them to gain higher rights than they would get when executed on their own.

***Affected products:***

The issue affects all Emsisoft installation packages (setups) that were compiled before 2016-01-08, in particular, EmsisoftAntiMalwareSetup.exe, EmsisoftInternetSecuritySetup.exe, and EmsisoftEmergencyKit.exe. You can verify the timestamp of signing in file properties under “Digital Signatures” (right-click on the file, select “Properties”, and click on the “Digital Signatures” tab to view this information).

Emsisoft code was never affected by this issue. The problem is limited to the installers (setup programs) that install our products on your computer, which are based on third-party installer technology.

***Fix:***

All installers were re-compiled with a fixed version of the installer technology on 2016-01-08.
 Older installers may still be safely executed from any new folder that does not contain any other DLL files.

***Security advise:***

Since this generic problem affects a high number of installers from various vendors, it is recommended to never execute downloaded programs directly from unsafe folders like “Downloads” or “Temp”. You may want to set the permissions of those folders to deny execution and/or always move downloaded programs into new and empty folders before executing or running them.

***Acknowledgements:***

Emsisoft would like to thank Stefan Kanthak for bringing this issue to our attention.
