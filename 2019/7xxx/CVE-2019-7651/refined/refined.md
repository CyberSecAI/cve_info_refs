The provided content includes a vulnerability report from Emsisoft, which details an ACL bypass vulnerability in their EPP.sys driver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The EPP.sys driver in Emsisoft Anti-Malware versions prior to 2018.12 lacks the `FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN` characteristic. This allows a local attacker to bypass Access Control Lists (ACLs) protecting the `\\.\EPP` device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing `FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN` flag in the driver's device characteristics.
- Improper protection of files and directories within the `\\.\EPP` device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker can use the exposed functionality of the driver to enumerate and read process details.
- Attackers gain access to process information they normally wouldn't have access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attacker leverages the driver's functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system where the vulnerable driver is installed.
- Ability to interact with the `\\.\EPP` device.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2018.12 of Emsisoft Anti-Malware, which was released on January 2nd, 2019.
- The fix was automatically applied to all users via online updates.
- The vulnerability was reported by Nafiez.
