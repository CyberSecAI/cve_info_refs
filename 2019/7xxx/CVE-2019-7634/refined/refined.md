- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization when updating user data in the SUAP v2 application. Specifically, the application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The injected malicious script is stored in the application's database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This allows the attacker to potentially perform actions such as:
    - Stealing cookies/session tokens
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites
    - Modifying page content
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Using tools like BeEF for further remote exploitation
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects the malicious script through a form field when updating user data. The injected script is then stored in the database, and is executed when the page containing that data is accessed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a valid user of the application with the capability to update their user data.
