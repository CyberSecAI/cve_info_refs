- **Root cause of vulnerability:** DLL preloading vulnerability in the Autodesk Desktop Application (ADA).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is susceptible to a DLL preloading attack. It loads DLL files from its working directory, allowing a malicious DLL to be loaded if placed there.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the ADA. This constitutes a privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must trick a user into downloading a malicious DLL file into the working directory of the Autodesk Desktop Application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to download a malicious DLL and place it in the correct location. This could be achieved through social engineering, drive-by download or other methods.
