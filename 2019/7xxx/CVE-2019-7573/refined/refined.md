{
  "CVE-2019-7573": {
    "vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer over-read in `InitMS_ADPCM` function in `audio/SDL_wave.c`.",
    "root_cause": "The `InitMS_ADPCM` function in SDL does not properly validate the length of the MS ADPCM format chunk, leading to out-of-bounds reads when processing crafted or truncated audio files. Specifically, the `wNumCoef` loop could read past the end of the chunk data if the chunk is too short.",
     "weaknesses": [
       "Buffer over-read",
       "Improper Input Validation"
     ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to open a specially crafted audio file that triggers the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a crafted audio file containing an improperly sized MS ADPCM chunk, thus an attacker needs to entice a user to open such a file.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted audio file and somehow convince a victim to open that file with an application that utilizes the vulnerable SDL library."
