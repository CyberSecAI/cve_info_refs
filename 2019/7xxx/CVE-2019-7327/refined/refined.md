The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2019-7327.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `frame.php` view in ZoneMinder insecurely prints the `scale` parameter value on the webpage without proper filtration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the webpage, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks such as:
    - Cookie theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Phishing
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Further compromise of the victim's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL that contains a JavaScript payload within the `scale` parameter. The victim has to visit the malicious link for the attack to be successful.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with an XSS payload and trick the victim into visiting it. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server, and the attack can be launched remotely.
