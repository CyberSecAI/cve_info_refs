Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) handler within Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is a critical authentication bypass. This means an attacker can potentially circumvent the normal authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to the AEM environment.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability is classified as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability which is a major security concern.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is specifically related to the SAML handler in AEM. This suggests that the attack vector involves manipulating or exploiting SAML authentication processes.
- This is a remote attack vector, meaning an attacker does not need local access to the AEM server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the AEM system's SAML authentication process. No special privileges are mentioned, so an unauthenticated attacker is likely able to exploit this issue.
- The attacker must have a way to send malicious requests to the affected system.
