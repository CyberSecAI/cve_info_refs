Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7663:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- An invalid address dereference occurs within the `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction` function in `libtiff/tif_dirwrite.c`. This function is used when writing the transfer function tag to a TIFF directory.
- Specifically, a crash occurs in `cpSeparateBufToContigBuf` function in `tiffcp.c` due to a missing check for NULL pointers in `td_transferfunction` array, leading to dereferencing of these NULL pointers
- A multiplication overflow is triggered in `readSeparateTilesIntoBuffer` causing the segfault
- The vulnerability is triggered by specific crafted TIFF files containing a non-standard tile width (e.g., 65534).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Invalid Address Dereference:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper validation of pointers before they are dereferenced, specifically when using the `_TIFFmemcmp` function within `TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction`.
- **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of `tilew` and `spp` in function `readSeparateTilesIntoBuffer` can overflow a 32-bit signed int if large values are passed, causing a crash.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The libtiff library does not properly validate certain aspects of the TIFF file format, including the tile width, leading to unexpected behavior when processing the file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to a segmentation fault, causing a crash in applications using libtiff, making them unavailable.
- **Potential Remote Code Execution:** Though not explicitly stated, some sources note that the vulnerability *could possibly* allow arbitrary code execution. However, most references only state DoS.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Crafted TIFF file:** The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted TIFF image file.
- **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when libtiff attempts to process a malformed TIFF file using tools like tiffcp and tiffset.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to deliver a crafted TIFF file:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed TIFF file to a target system or application. This might be through email, a web page, or another mechanism.
- **User interaction:** The user needs to open the malicious TIFF file using a vulnerable application, making this a user-assisted exploit.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue stems from how libtiff handles the `transferfunction` tag. It can sometimes fail to initialize all pointers within the `td_transferfunction` array.
- Patches involve checking for NULL pointers before dereferencing and adding checks to prevent integer overflow
- Several bug reports, commits and security advisories link CVE-2019-7663 to CVE-2018-17000 and CVE-2018-19210, suggesting these are all related to similar code handling issues in libtiff
- Some fixes also include hardening against further issues triggered by malformed TIFF images
