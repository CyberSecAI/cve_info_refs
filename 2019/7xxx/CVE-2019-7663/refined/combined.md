Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via a crafted tiff file. This is different from CVE-2018-12900.

However, <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/merge_requests/60> is meant as a fix for CVE-2018-17000 in the first place, as far as I understand, as known as [bug 1108606](show_bug.cgi?id=1108606 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-1: CVE-2018-17000: tiff: NULL pointer dereference in the function _TIFFmemcmp at tif_unix.c (called from TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction)"), as known as  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2811>  See tiff-CVE-2018-17000,19210.patch  I have created the fix before <https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/merge_requests/60> was known.  I hope I explained enough, if not, please ask. So if I were you, I would move tiff_dir.c part of *CVE-2019-7663* to *CVE-2018-17000,19210* (replacing the current one there).  Note. You may find patch naming *CVE-20xx-xxxx* as a drawback in this case. It comes from hundreds of patches I have created for php* and *Magick. There was a *lot* of such situations like this here, especially for magicks. I believe I would be lost in changelog entries, especially because of policies we have for them. While keeping correct, the patch names are the only quick hint what is actually patch doing. It works for me so quite well When you find another system, please do share it with me. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1125113#c10)  Petr Gajdos   2019-02-14 09:25:16 UTC  ``` I guess libldap2_r is used, for example in 15, because of:  $ ls -l /usr/lib64/libldap.so lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Aug 29 15:00 /usr/lib64/libldap.so -> libldap_r.so $ ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1125113#c11)  Petr Gajdos   2019-02-14 10:52:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Petr Gajdos from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1125113#c10)) > I guess libldap2_r is used, for example in 15, because of: >  > $ ls -l /usr/lib64/libldap.so > lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Aug 29 15:00 /usr/lib64/libldap.so -> libldap_r.so > $  Sorry, bad window. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1125113#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-28 17:20:24 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:0786-1: An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202003-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibTIFF, the worst of
which could result in a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.1.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.1.0** |

### Background

The TIFF library contains encoding and decoding routines for the Tag
Image File Format. It is called by numerous programs, including GNOME and
KDE applications, to interpret TIFF images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing the user to process a specially crafted
TIFF file, could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.1.0"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1108606#c0)  Karol Babioch   2018-09-17 07:24:29 UTC  ``` CVE-2018-17000  A NULL pointer dereference in the function _TIFFmemcmp at tif_unix.c (called from TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction) in LibTIFF 4.0.9 allows an attacker to cause a denial-of-service through a crafted tiff file. This vulnerability can be triggered by the executable tiffcp.  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-17000> <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-17000.html> <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2811> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1108606#c1)  Karol Babioch   2018-09-21 12:14:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 783874](attachment.cgi?id=783874 "QA reproducer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=783874&action=edit "QA reproducer") QA reproducer ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1108606#c2)  Karol Babioch   2018-09-21 12:28:18 UTC  ``` At least I wasn't able to reproduce this on SLE12/15.

I can reproduce segfault for 12,15,TW/tiff both with -i or without it:  $ tiffcp poc out TIFFReadDirectoryCheckOrder: Warning, Invalid TIFF directory; tags are not sorted in ascending order.

Defining non-color channels as ExtraSamples.. poc: Error, cannot handle BitsPerSample that is not a multiple of 8. Segmentation fault (core dumped) $  At least we know that this issue introduced by patch for CVE-2017-9935. On the first guess, error handling is not sufficient now? ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1108606#c7)  Petr Gajdos   2018-10-17 09:41:20 UTC  ``` I have updated upstream bug with my findings, let us see how upstream fixes it. One of possibilities to work this around would be to add sanity check to  TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction() and do not run _TIFFmemcmp() when tif->tif_dir.td_transferfunction[2] or tif->tif_dir.td_transferfunction[1] respectively are NULL.  Perhaps better would be to have tif_dir.td_extrasamples value correct. I tried to poke around for a while with no success.  I would wait rather for upstream patch for now. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1108606#c8)  Petr Gajdos   2018-10-19 08:41:11 UTC  ``` I believe all fixed. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1108606#c10)  Petr Gajdos   2019-01-14 12:37:53 UTC  ``` Correct.

# USN-3906-1: LibTIFF vulnerabilities

12 March 2019

LibTIFF could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [tiff](/security/cves?package=tiff) - Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library

## Details

It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed

images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially

crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

Debian Bug     : 902718 908778 909038 913675 934780

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the TIFF library, which may
result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if
malformed image files are processed.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.8-2+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

For the detailed security status of tiff please refer to its security
tracker page at:

Package        : tiff
Version        : 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-17000 CVE-2018-19210 CVE-2019-7663

Brief introduction

CVE-2018-17000

    A NULL pointer dereference in the function _TIFFmemcmp at tif_unix.c
    (called from TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction) allows an
    attacker to cause a denial-of-service through a crafted tiff file. This
    vulnerability can be triggered by the executable tiffcp.

CVE-2018-19210

    There is a NULL pointer dereference in the TIFFWriteDirectorySec function
    in tif_dirwrite.c that will lead to a denial of service attack, as
    demonstrated by tiffset.

CVE-2019-7663

    An Invalid Address dereference was discovered in
    TIFFWriteDirectoryTagTransferfunction in libtiff/tif_dirwrite.c,
    affecting the cpSeparateBufToContigBuf function in tiffcp.c. Remote
    attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service
    via a crafted tiff file.

    We believe this is the same as CVE-2018-17000 (above).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.0.3-12.3+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
