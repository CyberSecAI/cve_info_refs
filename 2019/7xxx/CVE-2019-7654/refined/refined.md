    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Wowza Streaming Engine Manager application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to craft malicious requests that, when triggered by an authenticated user, perform unauthorized actions.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist within the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager application. Specifically, the application does not properly validate requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick an authenticated administrator into performing actions they did not intend, such as adding a new administrator account. This could lead to full compromise of the application, including full control over the Wowza Streaming Engine.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to a vulnerable endpoint within Wowza Streaming Engine Manager. The attacker then tricks the administrator into accessing this page while the administrator is authenticated.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create malicious web pages and lure an authenticated administrator user to visit that page. The targeted user must have an active session with Wowza Streaming Engine Manager."
