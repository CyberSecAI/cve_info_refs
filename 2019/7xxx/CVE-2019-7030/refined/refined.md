Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-7030:

**Root Cause:** Integer Overflow

**Vulnerability:** The software is vulnerable to an integer overflow, which can occur when a calculation results in a value that is too large to be stored in the allocated memory space.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure. While not leading to arbitrary code execution like some other vulnerabilities listed, an integer overflow can lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory locations they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:** The document does not specify the exact attack vector. However, the vulnerability lies in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, meaning that an attacker would likely need to provide a maliciously crafted PDF document that triggers this integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need the ability to create or modify PDF documents and to have a victim open the malicious document using a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
