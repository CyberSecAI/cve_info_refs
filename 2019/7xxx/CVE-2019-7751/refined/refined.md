## CVE-2019-7751

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Directory Traversal

**Vulnerability:**

*   A directory traversal and local file inclusion vulnerability exists in the `FPProducerInternetServer.exe` service/utility within MarcomCentral FusionPro VDP Creator.
*   The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on accessing folders through the service.
*   The exploit doesn't require "slash-dot-dots" (`/../..`) to traverse directories, though they can be added.

**Impact:**

*   Remote attackers can list or enumerate sensitive contents of files on the affected system.
*   Potential for privilege escalation by dumping the local machine's SAM and SYSTEM database files.
*   Access to common files that contain plaintext credentials.
*   Possible remote code execution.

**Attack Vector:**

*   A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the affected service, specifying the path to the file they wish to access.
*   The service, by default, listens on port 8080.
*   Example: `<http://><host.domain.tld>:<port#>/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the affected host and port (default 8080).
*   No authentication is required.

**Affected Software:**

*   MarcomCentral FusionPro VDP Creator versions prior to 10.0 (version 9.3 was tested).
*   The vendor suggests that versions 10.0 and 10.1 might also be affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Disable the "FusionPro Internet Request Handler" service.
*   Delete the `FPProducerInternetServer.exe` executable (C:\Windows\SysWOW64\FPProducerInternetServer.exe), but the impact on the software's functionality is unknown.
*   Upgrade to the latest version of FusionPro VDP Creator.
