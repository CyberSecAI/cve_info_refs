**Summary:**
Adobe has released security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and macOS. These updates address multiple vulnerabilities, including a Use-After-Free vulnerability identified as CVE-2019-7050. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

**Vulnerability Details:**
*   **Vulnerability Category:** Use After Free
*   **Vulnerability Impact:** Arbitrary Code Execution
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **CVE Number:** CVE-2019-7050

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a Use-After-Free issue. This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to corruption or code execution if the memory has been reallocated.

**Attack vectors:**
The document does not specify the exact attack vector. However, it can be inferred that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF document that triggers the Use-After-Free condition in Adobe Acrobat or Reader during processing. The attacker would need to get the victim to open the malicious PDF file using a vulnerable version of Acrobat or Reader.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would require the ability to create a malicious PDF file and convince a user to open it with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the Use-After-Free vulnerability (CVE-2019-7050) could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This could allow an attacker to install malware, steal sensitive information, or take control of the affected system.
