Based on the provided texts, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7761:

**CVE Description:** Use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC that can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Root Cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the way pages with interactive fields and optional content groups (OCGs) are handled in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. Specifically, changing the state of an OCG layer causes an object to be freed prematurely. When focus returns to the first page, the freed memory is reused, leading to memory corruption.

**Vulnerability:** Use-after-free.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious PDF file.
*   Visiting a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerability.
*   Specially crafted email attachment.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Ability to craft a malicious PDF file with embedded JavaScript code.
*   Ability to trick a user into opening the malicious PDF or visiting a malicious webpage.

**Technical Details (from Talos report):**

*   The malicious PDF requires multiple pages.
*   JavaScript code is used to manipulate interactive fields and OCGs.
*   The `app.activeDocs[0].selectPageNthWord(0)` function call is used to switch focus between pages, triggering the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability occurs when the state of an OCG layer is changed (`this.getOCGs()[0].state = false;`) causing an object to be freed.
*   The freed memory is then reused when focus returns to the first page, leading to memory corruption.
