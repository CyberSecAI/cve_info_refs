Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-7410:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause was the improper handling of the `$page_title` variable in the `show.html.ep` template of the Galileo CMS. Specifically, the `$page_title` was directly outputted into the HTML banner without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript or HTML code could be injected into the `page_title` field of a page through the CMS interface. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when the page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into the page title, leading to a variety of malicious actions when the page is rendered. This could include:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Modifying the content or behavior of the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user.
*  The XSS payload will be triggered when a user visits the page, or even upon logging in or logging out.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector was through the CMS's web interface, specifically via the "PAGE TITLE" field while editing a page.
*   **Authenticated Users:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Galileo CMS to inject the malicious code into the page title field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the ability to edit pages within the Galileo CMS.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code was located in `/lib/Galileo/files/templates/page/show.html.ep`.
*   The vulnerable line was:
    ```
    % content_for banner => $page_title;
    ```
    This line directly outputted the `$page_title` variable to the banner without escaping.
*   The fix implemented in version 0.043 was to escape the `$page_title` by changing the line to:
    ```
    % content_for banner => <%= $page_title %>;
    ```
    The `<%= ... %>` syntax in Mojolicious templates provides XML escaping by default.
