Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database. Specifically, the `username`, `password`, and `repassword` fields in the `adminaddsave` action are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized user input containing JavaScript code into the database. This stored malicious payload is later executed when the data is retrieved and displayed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application, potentially allowing them to:
    - Steal session cookies and other sensitive information.
    - Deface the website.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    - Gain unauthorized access to administrative functions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/waimai/admin.php?m=Member&a=adminaddsave` with malicious JavaScript in the `username`, `password`, and `repassword` fields.
- When an administrator or a user with access views the page displaying the injected data, the JavaScript code executes within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to submit a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/waimai/admin.php?m=Member&a=adminaddsave`.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the request parameters to inject malicious scripts.
- No authentication is mentioned, so it's unclear if an attacker needs to be logged in, but the target page is for adding administrators, suggesting an admin account may be needed.

**Additional Details**
- The provided content is a GitHub issue that reports and details the stored XSS vulnerability.
- It includes the vulnerable endpoint, the HTTP request parameters, and a screenshot to verify the attack.
- The issue was reported by user `wxdigo8`.
- The vulnerability is present in the `waimai` project.
- The specific payload used is `'><script>alert(1)</script>`.
