```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in Video Station, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can inject and execute malicious scripts within the administrator's management console. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes such as session hijacking, defacement of the UI or redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the Video Station application, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are then executed in the context of the administrator's browser session.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script through the Video Station application. This suggests the attacker could be an authenticated user or someone exploiting a separate vulnerability to get their malicious code injected."
