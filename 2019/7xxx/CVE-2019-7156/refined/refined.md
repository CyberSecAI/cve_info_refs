Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7156:

*   **Vulnerability:** Division by zero error.
*   **Root Cause:** A crafted input file can cause a division by zero error in `ole.c:390` within the `calcFileBlockOffset` function of the `libdoc` library. Specifically, the `sbdPerSector` variable can be zero, leading to the error when calculating `sbdSecNum`.
*   **Weakness:** The code lacks proper input validation or error handling to prevent division by zero.
*   **Impact:** The division by zero error causes the program to crash (Arithmetic exception - SIGFPE). This can lead to a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can provide a specially crafted document file (e.g., a malformed `.doc` file) to a program using the `libdoc` library.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious input file to a program that utilizes the vulnerable `libdoc` library.
*   **Affected Component:** `libdoc.a` (the `libdoc` library).
*   **File and Line Number:** `ole.c:390`.
*   **Function:** `calcFileBlockOffset`
*   **PoC:** A PoC file named `libdoc_poc3.zip` is provided, which likely triggers the vulnerability.
