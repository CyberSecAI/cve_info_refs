## Description

![@dcianciulli](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6922805?u=ca074a023886256f550b264e164a4b9b85f95568&v=4&size=48)[dcianciulli](https://github.com/dcianciulli)opened [on Jan 30, 2019](https://github.com/davidrthorn/cross_reference/issues/32#issue-404842377)
### Overall description

A stored XSS vulnerability in the preview boxes in the configuration panel may allow a malicious user to use both label text and references text to inject arbitrary javascript code (via script tags, event handlers, etc.).

Since the code is stored by the plugin, the attacker may be able to target anyone that open the configuration panel of the plugin.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new document with the plugin enabled;
2. Either leave selected the current category, or create a new one;
3. In either the label text box or the references text box (or both if you prefer) insert one of the following codes:
   * `<script>alert(1);</script>`
   * `<img src=x onerror='alert(1)'/>`
4. Press "Save and apply"
5. Now, when the victim open the configuration panel and select the category of the step 2, a popup will appear. Categories are shown in alphabetical order, so if the chosen one in step 2 is the first to be shown, the victim does not even need to select it to be affected.

Please note that examples proposed are only for demonstration. An attacker may inject arbitrary harmful javascript code.

### Resolution

You need to escape any html tag from within the preview box in the configuration panel.

## Description

An issue was discovered in the Cross Reference Add-on 36 for Google Docs. Stored XSS in the preview boxes in the configuration panel may allow a malicious user to use both label text and references text to inject arbitrary JavaScript code (via SCRIPT elements, event handlers, etc.). Since this code is stored by the plugin, the attacker may be able to target anyone who opens the configuration panel of the plugin.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
