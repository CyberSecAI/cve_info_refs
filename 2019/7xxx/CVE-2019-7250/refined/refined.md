Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the "Cross Reference Add-on 36" for Google Docs. The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input in the configuration panel's preview boxes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored within the plugin's settings.
- Improper Input Handling: The application does not sanitize or encode user-provided data entered into the "label text" and "references text" fields within the plugin's configuration panel before rendering it in preview boxes.
- Lack of Output Encoding: The application fails to encode the stored input before outputting it, allowing the execution of injected JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the plugin's configuration panel.
- User Compromise: Any user who opens the configuration panel of the plugin and views a category with injected JavaScript will have that code executed in their browser.
- Potential for Malicious Actions: The attacker could potentially use the injected JavaScript to perform malicious actions like stealing cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, or performing other actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The attacker injects the malicious script into the "label text" or "references text" fields in the plugin's configuration panel.
- When a victim opens the plugin's configuration panel and views categories, the injected script gets executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to modify/store data within the plugin's configuration settings, or to have someone else to do it.
- The attacker does not need privileges, but needs user interaction from the victim to trigger the vulnerability.
- No special user permissions are required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in the preview boxes within the configuration panel.
- The injected code is stored by the plugin and will be executed whenever the configuration panel is opened.
- The issue is assigned CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The severity is considered moderate with a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1.
