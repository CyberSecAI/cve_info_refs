Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2019-7308:

**CVE-2019-7308**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insufficient hardening against Spectre V1 attacks in the eBPF implementation of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the kernel performed undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, including cases of different branches with different states or limits to sanitize.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   The eBPF verifier did not adequately prevent out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic.
    *   The verifier was not sanitizing ALU operations correctly when the same operation was used on a pointer and a scalar from different branches.
    *   Missing checks and sanitization of pointer operations in verifier code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A local attacker could expose sensitive information (kernel memory) through side-channel attacks leveraging Spectre V1.
    *   Denial of service via system crash.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local access is required.
    *   An attacker can leverage a crafted eBPF program.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local attacker with the ability to load eBPF bytecode.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Ubuntu:**
    *   Ubuntu Security Notices USN-3930-1, USN-3930-2, and USN-3931-1, and USN-3931-2, all mention the fix for CVE-2019-7308 in the Linux kernel, indicating it's a vulnerability affecting multiple Ubuntu releases and kernel versions.
    *   The fixes are provided for various kernel flavors like `linux`, `linux-aws`, `linux-azure`, `linux-gcp`, `linux-kvm`, `linux-raspi2`, `linux-oem`, and `linux-oracle`. This demonstrates the fix covers a wide range of Ubuntu setups.
*   **openSUSE:**
    *   openSUSE-SU-2019:1193-1 also references CVE-2019-7308.
    *   The description states: "kernel/bpf/verifier.c performed undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including cases of different branches with different state or limits to sanitize, leading to side-channel attacks". This is in agreement with the CVE description.
*   **SUSE:**
    *   SUSE documents the vulnerability in their CVE entry for CVE-2019-7308, and also states "kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.20.6 performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including cases of different branches with different state or limits to sanitize, leading to side-channel attacks."
    *   SUSE rates this as an "important" security issue.
    *   SUSE includes a variety of related advisories, including:
        *   SUSE-SU-2019:0765-1
        *   SUSE-SU-2019:0767-1
        *   SUSE-SU-2019:0784-1
        *   SUSE-SU-2019:0785-1
        *  openSUSE-SU-2019:1193-1
*   **Kernel Commit:**
    *   Commit `d3bd7413e0ca40b60cf60d4003246d067cafdeda` from the Linux kernel Git repository directly addresses CVE-2019-7308 by fixing sanitation of ALU operations with pointer/scalar types from different paths.
        *   The commit message specifically mentions that the previous fix, `979d63d50c0c`, did not handle a case where the same ALU operation was used on pointer and numeric registers from different branches with different state or limits to sanitize.
        *   It also states that out-of-bounds speculation occurs because the kernel incorrectly tries to sanitize based on the pointer's limit.
        *  The commit adds code to reject the program if this condition occurs.
    *   Commit `979d63d50c0c0f7bc537bf821e056cc9fe5abd38` ("bpf: prevent out of bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic") is related to this vulnerability, but it wasn't sufficient to prevent it completely. The later patch, `d3bd7413e0ca`, addresses this.
        *   The commit message explains that previous mitigation was not sufficient to prevent out of bounds memory access during speculation.
        *   It indicates a generic BPF attack pattern where a map pointer is loaded into a register, an index is loaded, a slow computation loads a limit into another register (which is masked to please the verifier), and then a conditional jump is used which is mistrained to cause a speculative load, leading to OOB access.
        *   The patch focuses on sanitizing pointer arithmetic on the offset, masking out-of-bounds speculation and introducing a form of simulation to find potential out-of-bounds access under speculative execution.

In summary, the information suggests that CVE-2019-7308 is a Spectre V1 vulnerability affecting the Linux kernel's eBPF implementation due to inadequate pointer arithmetic sanitization. Patches for this vulnerability have been made available for Ubuntu, openSUSE, and SUSE, and the relevant commits are visible in the mainline kernel repository. It should be fixed with: `d3bd7413e0ca40b60cf60d4003246d067cafdeda`
