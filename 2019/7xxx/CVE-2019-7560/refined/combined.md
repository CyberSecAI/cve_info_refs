## Description

![@bugs-syssec](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42843740?v=4&size=48)[bugs-syssec](https://github.com/bugs-syssec)opened [on Jan 15, 2019](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector/issues/28#issue-399446611)

While fuzzing boolector,

this input file
```
(assert(bvcomp#xe#x5))
(check-sat)
(get-unsat-assumptions)

```

was found, which leads to a use after free in btor\_delete.

The attached file contains more lines leading to the same crash, the above file contains the minimal version.

## Description

![@bugs-syssec](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42843740?v=4&size=48)[bugs-syssec](https://github.com/bugs-syssec)opened [on Jan 15, 2019](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector/issues/29#issue-399453810)

While fuzzing boolector,

this input file
```
(assert#b0)
(check-sat)
(get-unsat-assumptions)
(get-unsat-assumptions)

```

was found, which leads to a use after free in get\_failed\_assumptions.

The input file looks like this is related to [#28](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector/issues/28), but the backtrace produced by ASAN is different, which is why this is filed as a separate issue.

The attached file contains more lines leading to the same crash, the above file contains the minimal version.
