The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7560. It describes two Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerabilities discovered in the Boolector SMT solver.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free in the `btor_delete` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of a specific input file, leading to a read operation on a memory location that has already been freed.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The vulnerability causes the program to crash. The ASAN trace indicates a heap-use-after-free error.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific input file that exploits the logic of the `btor_delete` function. The attacker needs to supply this crafted input to the Boolector SMT solver.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to supply input to the Boolector SMT solver.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free in the `boolector_get_failed_assumptions` function.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A crafted input causes a use after free vulnerability in `boolector_get_failed_assumptions`. The issue is related to how memory is handled when retrieving failed assumptions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** This vulnerability also leads to a program crash, indicated by the ASAN trace as a heap-use-after-free error and by Valgrind as an invalid read of size 8 from freed memory.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a specific input file to the Boolector SMT solver. The input file contains commands that will exercise the vulnerable code path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to provide input to the Boolector SMT solver.

**Additional Details:**

*   Both vulnerabilities were discovered during fuzzing.
*   The provided ASAN and Valgrind traces pinpoint the exact locations and call stacks leading to the UAF errors.
*   Both issues have been reported on the Boolector GitHub repository, with the input files and crash logs attached.
*   The issue report #29 states that the issue might be related to issue #28, but the backtraces are different, therefore they were filed separately.
*   The affected version is Boolector 3.0.1-pre.

These vulnerabilities can be triggered by providing a malicious input file, which results in a crash due to the use-after-free.
