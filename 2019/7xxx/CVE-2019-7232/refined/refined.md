- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ABB IDAL HTTP server has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when a large Host header is sent in an HTTP request. The large header overwrites a buffer, including the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) address.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can overwrite the SEH address and execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request with a Host header value of 2047 bytes or more.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed.
