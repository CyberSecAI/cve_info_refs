- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before writing it to log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Log injection vulnerability. Untrusted data is written to log files without validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary log entries, potentially misleading log audits, covering attack traces, or performing other malicious actions. This leads to failure in accountability, non-repudiation and incident forensics capability.
- **Attack vectors**: By enticing the victim to visit a specially crafted link, an attacker can inject a custom log message into the application's logs through a POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to a vulnerable endpoint (index.php) on the application server. They do not need prior authentication.
