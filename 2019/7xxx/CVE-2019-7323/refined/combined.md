6, 2020)  **New Features:** •  Can now force a specific Log Parser to be used when loading some logs (also available for bookmarks and workspace elements) •  Can now use %e{...} for Alerts (mail, app)

connections •  Parsers can now provide a description for their user-defined fields (with basic HTML formatting supported), to be displayed in log entries table column tooltip, through new optional API method [LogFileParser.getUserDefinedFieldDesription()](https://logmx.com/dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/mgr/LogFileParser.html#getUserDefinedFieldDesription-java.lang.String-) •  In "Entries details"

multiple files were opened in a merged view in AutoRefresh with a substantial throughput (on rare occasion the UI could become unresponsive) •  When a merged view of multiple logs was opened in

silently ignored by macOS native app launcher) •  The "Report bug" feature was not able to upload files •  Could not open SocketManager logs (and custom Managers of type "LiveStream") through Bookmarks in AutoRefresh mode •  In some cases, the default value of LogManager parameters was not honored (e.g. "false" value used if param was missing, instead of using the default value "true")

default, now using softer colors for log levels (using the new "Soft" color theme) •  Now supporting the characters "Y", "L", and "u" in Date Formats (were introduced in Java 8, but are rarely used) •  Now displaying the Java version+arch in "About" window (more convenient for investigation, compared to the System properties window)  **Bugfixes:** •  [**SECURITY**] Fix a vulnerability (man-in-the-middle attack) during in-app updates (now properly checking downloaded updates integrity+authenticity) •  Console mode process didn't end in some cases, once all the tasks were completed  v7.3.0 (October 8, 2018)  **Changes:** •  In Parser creation dialog, when browsing for a test file to load, now also displaying hidden files •  Slightly reduced memory footprint thanks to lazy image loading •  Now displaying the "Export" menu item in the "File" menu as well •  When using Socket Manager, made it more clear when a third-party JAR is missing  **Bugfixes:** •  On Windows, fixed a case where the log file currently monitored in Tail mode could not be rotated by the process writing to this log file. •  Fixed a UI bug that occurred when the "Open logs wizard" was used and its option "Custom log format" was picked: in the Parser creation dialog that was opened, the Date format field could not be used because it could never keep the focus (for all kind of Parsers)  v7.2.0 (August 6, 2018)  **New Features:** •  Can now organize bookmarks in a tree instead of a flat list (now using hierarchical structure with folders)  **Changes:** •  Improved start time, and reduced

https://logmx.com) •  Now using HTTPS instead of HTTP to connect to LogMX website (check for updates, bug reports, ...) •  [Windows installer] Now including Java 8 update 181 (instead of 8 update 60), to allow, amongst other things, the use of LogMX website SSL certificate to check for new versions •  Added missing App Version in macOS native app metadata (only "short version" was set, not "version")  **Bugfixes:** •  Fixed the "Search online" feature that didn't work properly if the searched text contained special characters •  When a Java Class Parser was exported by a Windows machine, it couldn't be successfully be imported on a macOS/Linux machine (source and class files couldn't be extracted from the export file)  v7.1.0 (May 28, 2018)  **New Features:** •  Can now search online (Google, Stack Overflow, ...) the text selected in the log entry details panel (can also add/edit/remove search engines)  **Changes:** •  Now providing a DMG package to install LogMX on macOS more easily (TGZ/ZIP archives still contain macOS binaries in case you prefer that)  **Bugfixes:** •  When the option "Sort emitters by name" was toggled in the Emitters tree, the previously hidden emitters appeared as displayed, but their entries were actually still hidden •  When opening some logs in AutoRefresh mode with the log level slider set on a log level more critical than all current log entries (i.e. all entries filtered out), new incoming log entries were lost until the user closed the dialog explaining why no log entries were displayed  v7.0.0 (April 16, 2018)  **New Features:** •  For each text field used to enter a date format, an interactive tooltip is now displayed with quick examples of date patterns and the current date using the entered date format  **Changes:** •  **Java 8+ is now required to run LogMX, support of Java 7 has been dropped** (Java 7 doesn't receive security updates anymore since Apr 2015, and Oracle is working on Java 11). By the way, since Oracle adopted a new, faster release schedule (a major version released every 6 months), be prepared to see Java 8 dropped for LogMX shortly (sorry, we have to keep track of Java versions support to provide you with better software) •  Adopted new versioning scheme: all public releases will now be vX.Y.0 (last digit now only used for internal builds and custom builds/patches for a single user) •  Windows native launchers (LogMX.exe/LogMX-64.exe) can now start LogMX properly using Java 10 •  When an URL is entered in the main toolbar, now ignoring extra whitespace character(s) at the beginning/end of the URL •  When the "Open logs" window is opened while no file is opened, now setting it up by default in the directory of the last opened file (if no "Default open directory" is set in Options) •  When adding a Java Class LogParser or a LogManager, the class path hierarchical explorer now also handles Java 9 and Java 10, and the content of the JDK/JRE is not displayed anymore to improve performances •  Added the HTTPServer and HTTPPServer Managers in the "Open logs wizard" •  By default, LogMX will now use up to 1 GB of RAM (instead of 800 MB) if MAX\_MEMORY is not set in "startup.conf" •  Updated LogMX API documentation so that it uses links to Java 8 instead of Java 7 •  New logo design •  Started to work on Java 9 compliance (fixed some code that couldn't compile against Java 9)  **Bugfixes:** •  When an existing "Bookmark" or "URL" was edited, the "login" field was replaced with a previously used login starting with the Bookmark/URL login (if any) as soon as the editor was opened •  [macOS] The macOS menu bar items didn't work anymore with Java 10 (so when ⌘+Q was used to quit LogMX, macOS killed the app without notifying LogMX, so the user preferences were not saved) •  [macOS] LogMX couldn't start in some cases on High Sierra, if install package was downloaded from the internet, because of macOS "$ecurity" feature •  If a Directory Manager took a long time to list the files to parse (e.g. great number of files processed by the server), switching back and forth between tabs displayed a red status message "Invalid file" until the file parsing started, for this merged file •  Fixed Health report generation (some user preferences were not exported correctly)    v6.2.x versions  v6.2.0 (March 23, 2018)  **New Features:** •  New HTTPSServerManager: Same as HTTPServerManager, but uses HTTPS instead of HTTP (get log entries by listening to HTTP POST)  **Changes:** •  If user chose to save Options to disk whenever Options are modified, now saving Bookmarks to disk as soon as they are modified (i.e. don't wait for LogMX to be closed to persist bookmarks) •  If user chose to save Options to disk whenever Options are modified, now saving log levels when a new log level is found in a file (i.e. don't wait for LogMX to be closed to persist bookmarks) •  [HTTPServerManager] Can now configure the HTTP headers to include in the returned response (through file "config/managers.properties") •  [macOS native app launcher] Now checking the presence of important distrib files/folders before starting the JVM so that if the user moved "LogMX.app" outside of the LogMX distrib (e.g. to "/Applications"), a message is displayed explaining why LogMX cannot be run •  Changed the default options so that the log level <NO\_LEVEL> (used when a log entry doesn't have any level) has a light-soft-pink color instead of plain red  **Bugfixes:** •  When searching for some text with the options "Search in all files" and "display results in new tab", some found occurrences were duplicated •  When a parser automatically created a new found log Level, it wasn't properly persisted to options file even if LogMX was exited properly (new level was missing when LogMX was restarted) •  When trying to open an SFTP/SCP/FTP[S] log with a login containing the "@" character, the connection could't be established because of an incorrect URL parsing (now using RFC 952 and RFC 1123 to parse hostname) •  When no suitable Parser was found for a file included in a merge, answering "Yes" to the question "Do you want to create a Parser now?" did not open the Parser creation dialog ([see forum](/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5880)) •  Some links didn't work in the ChangeLog (new version announcement)    v6.1.x versions  v6.1.1 (February 21, 2018)  **New Features:** •  New export type: Clipboard (can now export the selected log entries and entry fields to the system clipboard so that it can be pasted in any other app,

LogMX was started in command line on macOS with Java 9 •  [macOS] Specifying the "Contents/Home/bin" directory for JAVA\_PATH now works (previously, only "Contents/Home/" and the java root directory worked)  **Bugfixes:** •  When searching for text across all opened files and displaying the results in a new tab, some opened files were excluded in the search •  Now handling the Log4j v2 date format %d{DEFAULT}, and also fixed the way %d{ISO8601} was handled: it will now map both Log4j v2 format (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss,SSS) and Log4j v1/Logback format (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS) •  [Log4j/Logback parsers] Now properly parsing patterns nested tags like "%replace{%replace{}{}{}}{}{}", and patterns containing a whitespace character before the TimeZone like "%d{d/M/y H:m:s, UTC}" •  When editing a bookmark that used SFTP "User Substitution" feature (sudo/su), the User Substitution options were all cleared in the UI (no user substitution, so if the bookmark was saved, the user substitution options were lost)  v6.1.0 (February 1, 2018)  **New Features:** •  When opening a Directory (local/SFTP/FTP/FTPS/SMB), can now use a date filter to only open the files modified the last X minutes (especially useful when used along with the 'recursive' option!) •  New Log Manager "HTTP Server": receives log entries sent through HTTP POSTs (embedded web server)  **Changes:** •  When using the Socket Manager, now displaying the first log entries as soon as they are received (i.e. don't wait anymore to receive the configured number of lines to detect Parser) •  HTTP[S] Log File Manager: Can now use a login/password to get resources requiring authentication credentials (in previous version, got HTTP 401 without the ability to provide a login/password) •  [macOS] When used with Java 9, now correctly handling macOS menu bar special actions (Preferences, About, Quit)  **Bugfixes:** •  macOS native launcher now supports Java 9, and will now try to use the Java runtime specified by JAVA\_PATH in "startup.conf" (if no path specified, will search for JDKs/JREs to use) •  When opening an existing URL in "Bookmark" or "URL" editor windows, optional fields that were set to the default value in the URL to open (e.g. SFTP port 22) had incorrect values when the window was displayed (the value of the last opened URL was used instead) •  When the "Find in all files" feature was used with option "Display results in new tab", only the log entries from the current active tab were displayed (now displaying log entries coming from all opened files, with a column indicating the file in which it was found) •  HTTPS Log Manager didn't detect compressed files, so it tried to parse ZIP/GZ/BZ/... files without decompressing them •  Trying to open a Tail view of a compressed file failed •  [IntelliJ plugin] New plugin version (v1.0.2): fixed a compatibility issue with IntelliJ 2017 (error message in IntelliJ logs each time the GotoSource feature was used) •  If some cases, the dialog "Open logs" couldn't be validated by hitting ENTER    v6.0.x versions  v6.0.2 (November 20, 2017)  **New Features:** •  Can now recursively discover the log files to open using {SFTP/FTP/FTPS/SMB/Local} directory Managers (through Manager new option "Recursive", the given file filter will now match relative paths) •  When a new version is available, LogMX now displays the

Redesigned all application icons •  Small tail size is now 4KB instead of 1KB, and default Tail mode size is now MEDIUM (10KB) instead of SMALL, to reduce the risk of reading only a fragment of a single log entry, which leads to an empty log entries table, and no Log Parser detected •  Now also supporting stack trace elements that contain a whitespace character just before the OSGi bundle info (e.g. "...(File.java:15) [log4j-core-2.7.jar:2.7]" instead of "...(File.java:15)[log4j-core-2.7.jar:2.7]") •  Log entries table cells now wrap text using its cell boundaries, instead of wraping at

on some Java StackTrace lines didn't work if a part of the line was highlighted by the "Find" feature •  Some entry fields could be missing in the "Find" and "Export" dialogs •  The "Abort file load" button didn't work for merged files (now it does!) •  When opening a log file exported by LogMX (using the "LogMX entries file" export format), some characters in the logs were not interpreted as expected ("&amp;" instead of "&", and "&#39;" instead of "'") •  When a log file was being loaded, the window status panel at the bottom could read "Invalid file" instead of "Load in progress" if user switched tabs multiple times during file load •  When the "Options" dialog was validated while a log file was being loaded, this log file load could fail •  Fixed minor graphical issues dealing with sub-menus layout  v6.0.0 (February 13, 2017)  **New Features:** •  Can now choose a log level for each Emitter, in order to virtually reduce its verbosity (option also available in Filtering States so that this filtering element can be reused quickly) •  Now also supporting a NetBeans plugin for the GotoSource feature, and can now also support any number and type of "GotoSource" plugin, from any IDE ([API available](/dev/ide-plugins/api) to build plugin) •  Can now report a bug and submit enhancement ideas directly in the app (new menu item in "Help" menu) •  Can now cancel all filtering elements through new menu item in "Filtering state" menu (i.e. display all log levels, cancel all filters, and enable all Emitters) •  [Export] When the export is completed successfully, now providing (in the message window displayed when Export is done) two new links: one to open the output file with the default system application, another to open the directory containing this output file (in

buttons) •  Upgraded from JSch v0.1.51 to v0.1.53 (library used for SCP/SFTP connections): bugfixes, new commuication protocols supported  **Bugfixes:** •  When trying to filter log entries by Timestamp while the current Log Parser did not handle absolute timestamp, LogMX could not display this warning message, an empty message was displayed, and the main GUI was frozen. •  When trying to add a log entry in an interlaced merged file while the current Log Parser did not handle absolute timestamp for this new entry, LogMX could not display this warning message, an empty message was displayed, and the main GUI was frozen. •  When monitoring a merged view of several files, removing one of these files from the filesystem could produce inconsistent display in log entries list •  On Mac OS, the keyboard shortcut ⌘-F2 didn't work (marking/unmarking a log entry) if the log entries table had the focus ([www.logmx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5719](http://www.logmx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5719)) •  When using a Filter based on timestamp on a file tab created by "Export to tab" or "Find" feature, the filter didn't work ([www.logmx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5732](http://www.logmx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5732)) •  Using the "Find" window, when the searched text could not be found, the dialog box saying that the text couldn't be found was displayed two times in some cases •  When the "Find" window was used to search for "X" in tab "TX", then for "Y" in tab "TY", opening this window back on "TX" (search option for "TY" still displayed) and clicking on "Find next" button went to next "X" occurrence, but "Y" was still specified in Find Window ([www.logmx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5735](http://www.logmx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5735)) •  Entries outline at the right of log entries table was not refreshed if log entries were sorted •  "Goto entry" feature could pick the wrong entry when entries table was sorted •  Fixed default output file name suggested when exporting logs coming from TCP/UDP or from a merged view of non-local files (the suggested name was not coherent or invalid for some file systems) •  When a log entries was selected (log entry details pane showing its details), if a new log file failed to be loaded, the log entry details pane still contained the details from the other valid log file •  When all files were closed, log entries count at the bottom right corner still displayed the last known entries count (instead of no entries)    v5.4.x versions  v5.4.4 (January 7, 2016)  **Bugfixes:** •  When LogMX was started with command line option "workspace:", opening a workspace that contained several "merge://" URLs opened a single tab with all workspace merged files (instead of multiple tabs) •  Fixed "mail" and "program" Alert actions that use "%e"/"%f" to print log entry/file: if this log entry/file contained the special character "$" or "\", the Alert action could not be performed  v5.4.3 (November 2, 2015)  **Changes:** •  AutoRefresh performance improved when used on merged logs •  AutoRefresh performance improved when used with Alerts •  Improved JUL (Java Util Logging) XML Parser so that its stack traces can be processed by "GotoSource" feature (i.e. open IDE for stack frame)  **Bugfixes:** •  Fixed incorrect parsing that could occur when opening a log directly in Tail mode (too few log entries were parsed) •  When a log file was rolled (rotated) during a Tail session, the whole file could be read in some situations (instead of its end only) •  When opening a merged view of logs in Tail mode, the log entries table might not display the source file name of each log entry (i.e. column "Merged file" of entries log) •  Fixed incorrect parsing that could occur when using Tail mode on SFTP file (some log entries could be duplicated) •  Fixed a bug that could occur while AutoRefresh was ON and when the log file was read from scratch (rolled/rotated file) •  Fixed a bug that could freeze the app in some rare occasions with some specific Java versions •  When opening a workspace whose first element is a merge, all following workspace elements were merged to the first one in a single tab (instead of a tab per workspace element) •  Fixed a Parsing error that occurred with Regex Parsers containing an empty group "()" •  When using option "Always use Auto-refresh" with SFTP and a very slow SFTP server: once the file was loaded, the first remote file update caused an error and the file was not refreshed anymore  v5.4.2 (September 29, 2015)  **New Features:** •  When using date/time filtering, now providing 12 predefined time intervals: using a single click, can now show log entries from the last 5 minutes, 5 hours, today, current week, …  **Changes:** •  Now saving Timeline settings in preferences file (keeping display settings to show/hide text and found/marked entries) so that your preferences are restored when LogMX is restarted •  Updated Readme file (LogMX Update instructions, TGZ package, typos)  **Bugfixes:** •  Previous version (v5.4.1) introduced a bug that replaced all occurrences of "\\" with "\" in Workspace elements URLs created with LogMX v5.4.0 or older (e.g. issues with Bookmark of Windows UNC URLs like "\\Host\Share\file")  v5.4.1 (September 2, 2015)  **New Features:** •  It's now easier to open a merged view of several logs coming from different LogManagers and/or different directories, thanks to *"File" > "Open several logs in a merged view"* •  Can now easily bookmark a merged view of several logs coming from different LogManagers and/or different directories •  When a I/O error occurs while Auto-refresh is on with SFTP, now automatically waiting for connection to be available again to restore the Auto-refresh state (no need to re-open a tab once the connection is back after a server reboot, a network failure, or when your computer gets back from sleeping mode)  **Changes:** •  When opening a bookmark that is a Merge of several files, now displaying the bookmark name in the file tab instead of "Merge#<ID\_merge>" (if LogMX considers that this bookmark name is nice to be displayed there) •  Now saving the merge "interleave" option for Bookmarks and URLs •  When no Parser is found to parse logs, now displaying the concerned log URL (useful in case of merged logs to know which file has an unknown format) •  Improved Windows launcher: error messages improved, and now detecting and alerting if 2Gb of RAM (or more) is requested for LogMX using Java 32-bits •  Windows launcher: Now fail if Java version specified in "startup.conf" doesn't work, instead of trying with all other Java versions installed on the system (could led to strange issues when 32 bits launcher "LogMX.exe" was used through desktop shortcut icon: specifying a 64 bits Java version with "MAX\_MEMORY" greater or equals to 2G failed because another 32-bits Java version was used instead). If a Java path is specified in "startup.conf", now LogMX uses it or doesn't start at all. •  Added a new option in "Open logs" Wizard to open a merge view of different logs •  In the "Bookmarks" window, now displaying a tooltip on bookmark URL cells (useful when URL is too long to fit in table cell) •  "GotoSource" feature: shortened IDE timeout (could wait more than 20s in some network situations, now limited to 6s) •  More robust to invalid Options file •  In Parser creation dialog, now allowing up to 100 lines to test your parser in "Parser test" bottom panel, and allowing you to paste a text of any size (LogMX now takes only the allowed remaining text size instead of rejecting all the pasted text if it is too long) •  Default startup configuration now includes two Alerts: one for ERROR entries, and another for ERROR/WARN entries  **Bugfixes:** •  Can now edit a Bookmark of "Merge" type (i.e. can edit the list of log URLs to merge) •  Fixed an error that occurred when trying to flush/delete SFTP files while AutoRefresh was enabled •  Fixed an error that could occur when trying to flush/delete a merge view while AutoRefresh was enabled •  When using the "Flush file" feature when receiving logs from the TCP/UDP LogManager, the emitters tree was not cleared (tree nodes present but with entries counter set to "0") •  When Auto-refresh was used and a previously "found" log entry was highlighted, if this "found" entry was removed (reached log entries limit, file flushed, file rolling, ...), the highlight could persist in some situations, on wrong log entries •  In "Options" window, "Encoding" tab, when "OK" button was hit before fonts settings were enabled in this tab, an error occurred and a small font was applied •  Fixed issues with some windows that could appear astride screen boundaries in some situations •  The default LogMX configuration used french Locale for default Parsers (minor issue since the Locale did not matter for these Parsers)  v5.4.0 (July 23, 2015)  **New Features:** •  New "GotoSource" feature: when a log contains a Java stack trace, can now make LogMX open Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA to go to any stack trace element (or simply see this element on a tooltip within LogMX) •  Can now change AutoRefresh delay thanks to 3 new settings, for Local files, Sockets, and other logs sources ("Tools" > "Options" > "Managers") •  Added 2 new options ("Tools" > "Options" > "Managers"): SocketManager queue max size (used to enqueue incoming data from different connections), and maximum number of lines/entries to read during each AutoRefresh pass. •  Parsers using SocketManager can now get the remote IP/port for the current log thanks to the new methods SocketManager.getLastRemote[Host/Port]() and [LogFileParser.getLogFileManager()](/dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/mgr/LogFileParser.html#getLogFileManager()) •  LogParsers can now get the LogManager that is currently reading the logs to parse, thank to the new method [LogFileParser.getLogFileManager()](/dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/mgr/LogFileParser.html#getLogFileManager()) •  Each LogFileManager can now force a specific AutoRefresh delay thanks to the new method [LogFileManager.getAutoRefreshDelay()](/dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/mgr/LogFileManager.html#getAutoRefreshDelay())  **Changes:** •  Greatly improved "Filter" performances (between 4 and 6 times faster) •  SocketManager can now handle several parallel TCP connections (coming from different IPs/ports) in a single logs tab •  Now displaying raw text received from socket if log format could not be detected using SocketManager (helps setting up LogMX and logger) •  In main window bottom status bar, now displaying number of displayed entries, and now formatting this number and the number of selected entries with a more readable format ("100000" -> "100,000") •  Now using colors on filtering toolbar to indicate whether the current filter is applied or not •  Added more details on memory status concerning the gap between current values and marked values •  Now displaying, in AutoRefresh toolbar, the number of parallel TCP connections (coming from different IPs/ports) when using SocketManager •  Now displaying, in "File Info" window, the list of parallel TCP connections (different IPs/ports) when using SocketManager •  Added debug logs in TCP/UDP Managers to show received non-serialized logs •  Avoid spurious logs and stack traces when using UDP SocketManager •  In the Windows installer including Java, now embedding Java 8, in a private JRE stored within LogMX directory  **Bugfixes:** •  Syslog built-in Parser did not parse some log entries as expected (did not handle some cases where optional fields are not present) •  When using a SocketManager, user-defined fields were not displayed in a new column of the log entries table •  "External applications" feature: could not start an external application if its path contained a whitespace character using Java 1.7 update 21 or more •  Fixed a bug that made LogMX display many spurious error messages when the format of logs received from a socket could not be detected •  Fixed an error (ConcurrentModificationException) that could occur in some cases when LogMX was started with a log URL as a command line parameter •  File "package-list" was missing in API Javadoc located in LogMX install directory (could lead to Javadoc detection failure in Eclipse for Parsers & Managers development)    v5.3.x versions  v5.3.4 (April 16, 2015)  **New Features:** •  Now also providing TGZ archive to install LogMX on Mac/Linux (same content than legacy ZIP archive, but avoids having to type "chmod +x logmx.sh") •  Now also including IntelliJ projects (already set up) to build Log Parsers & Managers •  Now also including Maven scripts to build Log Parsers & Managers •  Now also including Gradle scripts to build Log Parsers & Managers  **Changes:** •  In "Alerts" window, added a new 2-states button "always on top" (so that this "Alerts" window can be set on top of all other windows to be always visible) •  [Parsers/Managers development]: Eclipse projects now easier to setup (no variable to define anymore to access LogMX jar file) •  Improved layout in "Export" window (can now use smaller window without hiding any graphical component) •  Alerts window icons redesigned, and minor quality improvement on some pictures  **Bugfixes:** •  When editing the "entries filter" part of a Filtering State, the calendar popup was not displayed for date filters •  When editing a time-based filter, some parts of the calendar popup could be outside of current window boundaries (alert editor or filtering state editor) •  When a filter was re-used (using the "favorites" icon), a text field was displayed at the right of this filter even if it dealt with log levels (log levels combo was displayed as expected, but a text field was displayed too) •  "Find" window was not closed once the button "Find" was hit when option "display result in new tab" was checked (regression introduced in v5.3.3) •  In Alerts settings window, clicking on button "Show Alerts window" did not display the Alerts window if it was behind main window •  "Open logs" window: when using a "Directory" Manager (e.g. SFTP Directory), now displaying available credentials icons in "login" field for the underlying Manager (e.g. SFTP), since these credentials are shared between those Managers •  Fixed internal logging component that could not produce some logs in some cases  v5.3.3 (March 9, 2015)  **New Features:** •  Can now choose to use word-wrap for text layout in Entry details panel (thanks to the new toggle button on Entry details panel toolbar) •  "Find" feature: can now search some text across all opened files •  "Find" feature: when browsing found matches, now also showing and highlighting found match in entry details panel (useful when found match did not show in main entries table because found match was outside the table cell visible area) •  Marked and found entries are now displayed in Timeline (can be turned off)  **Changes:** •  "Find" window can now be used to browse results (window is now kept opened by default once browsing starts) •  "Open logs" window: In eval version, now displaying the file limit dialog box only one time, and only once the LogManager successfully browsed the directory •  Now saving "Find" window's position and size in user options •  When editing a Log4j/Logback Pattern Parser, the tags settings are now no more reseted when a tag option is modified (e.g. from "%d{dd/MM/yy}" to "%d{dd/MM/yyyy}") •  If a user-defined LogManager returns 'null' in "prepareForReading()" (should not occur), now detecting it and throwing a nice Exception with a clear message to ease LogManager development (a NullPointerException occurred and user could not tell why using the stack trace) •  When LogMX is started using "logmx.sh", "logmx.command", or "LogMX.bat", now allowing variable "JAVA\_PATH" (in "startup.conf") to point to Java root directory instead of its "bin" directory (common mistake) (".exe" launchers already allowed this) •  Improved some graphical elements (re-designed checkboxes/radiobuttons, some icons quality improved, blue color now used for all selected elements, more homogeneous and coherent colors)  **Bugfixes:** •  ***Fixed a major bug*** that prevented several LogManagers (eg: FTP/FTPS/SFTP/SCP) to connect to the desired host: the system proxy (defined at OS level) was used even if LogMX option "use system proxy" was not chosen (it occurred when system proxy was set for sockets). •  [Timeline] When timeline graph's width changed (e.g. main window resized), its blue selection rectangle was not located at the right position •  When using a Log4j/Logback Pattern Parser containing something like "%10t" or "%-10t" (Thread left/right justified), LogMX did not remove the extra whitespace characters before or after Thread name •  Timeline did not display correct graph if Log Parser provided relative dates (graph started in 1970), now first trying to use absolute date if available •  In "Open log" dialog, when a browser panel was closed because a connection parameter was changed, clicking on the "Browse" button had no effect in some cases (a second click was needed in these cases to display the browser) •  When editing a Log4j/Logback Pattern Parser, the tags settings might not be used to parse the previously entered sample text when the dialog reappeared •  If memory status graph was detached from toolbar, and its detached window was closed, the menu item still displayed "Hide memory status" instead of "Show memory status"  v5.3.2 (February 16, 2015)  **New Features:** •  Now providing a Wizard to open logs, in order to ease LogMX set up (selection/creation of Managers/Parsers) •  New HTTP/HTTPS log Managers (can now read logs from HTTP/HTTPS, even with an Evaluation version)  **Changes:** •  Improved Workspaces management dialog: can now select multiple tree elements to open/remove all of them at the same time, can now expand/collapse the whole tree using a right-click on the tree, and now automatically collapsing tree by default when dialog opens if there are more than 30 elements (visibility improved) •  Maximizing the "Entry details panel" (by double-clicking on its toolbar) now also uses all available space at the left of the window (not only at the top) •  For Log4j/Logback/Regex parsers, now handling the 'f' character in date format as an alias for 'S' (milliseconds), in order to also handle Log4Net date format (which is very similar to Log4J/Logback/Java date format) •  Added links to "Parsers" and "Managers" options in "File" menu •  Web links to download LogMX updates are now specific for eval/pro versions (popup when a new LogMX version is available)  **Bugfixes:** •  On Windows 8/8.1/10, the "Power-user menu" (aka "Win+X menu" or "Quick access menu") did not work anymore when LogMX "Windows shell extension" was installed (only the last four menu items worked, all the others produced no effect when clicked) •  When sorting log entries using 2 or 3 columns, entries might not be sorted correctly on columns 2 or 3 when column 1 or 2 contained the same value repeated several times (see [forum](forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1657)) •  In "Network" tab of "Options" window, when editing a saved account while accounts table is sorted (by any column), the wrong account was modified •  Fixed "Filtering State" editor: when opening an existing Filtering State, the "OK" button might be disabled but it should not (and also fixed some tooltips in this dialog window) •  In "Open logs" dialog, credentials availability for selected account (e.g. password, private key) might not be updated correctly without a restart  v5.3.1 (January 9, 2015)  **New Features:** •  Can now sort log entries by any column(s) (3 max columns at the same time) •  In LogParser creation wizard, can now directly choose a file to test the Parser  **Changes:** •  In "Options" window, when going to the "Encoding" tab, now all Font stuff is loaded in background ("Options" window is not frozen anymore while fonts are loading (which could take a few seconds if a great number of fonts are installed) •  Added a parameter in startup configuration file ("startup.conf") to customize JVM options (useful to fix memory issues with some 64-bits JVMs on multi-processors configurations) •  Now automatically adding new parameters to startup configuration file "startup.conf" on all OSes (and not only when using the Windows installer) •  Added details on date format to use to create filters •  [AutoRefresh] When a great number of log entries are removed from entries table due to log entries limit set by user, the operation took more than 30 seconds, without any feedback for this background operation (now takes less than 1 or 2 seconds, with an hourglass mouse pointer) •  FTPS Log Manager now always accept all X509 certificates (some FTPS connections could fail in previous versions) •  Can now quickly go to log levels options doing a right click on log levels sliders •  Minor graphical improvements in "Open file" window for remote Managers (tooltips now also available on multiple-choice parameters, and clickable area of check boxes now reduced to checkbox size only instead of full row width) •  For all text fields, can now use Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End to go to the begin/end of the line (only Home/End worked)  **Bugfixes:** •  When LogMX could not completely load a file due to a "OutOfMemory" error, the associated error message (and its note to avoid this) might not be always displayed correctly (due to low memory) •  In Options window, some graphical tables might not be displayed correctly if their columns were reordered •  Timeline tooltip might not be always visible if mouse was on the right hand side of the timeline, and next to screen right border  v5.3.0 (November 24, 2014)  **New Features:** •  New "Timeline" feature: adds a timeline view in main window, to see the quantity of

files, and directories (local, SFTP, FTP[S]) •  Now supporting file deletion feature on merged files, and directories (local, SFTP, FTP[S])  **Changes:** •  When no suitable parser was found for a log file, and user chooses to create a new Parser, now using the beginning of this log file as the sample text to parse in Parser creation wizard, to ease Parser creation •  When a FTP[S] file could not be deleted via "Delete file" feature (e.g. file locked), no error message was displayed in some cases •  Added details about ISO8601 date format in help files •  Default configuration now allows LogMX to use up to 600 MB of RAM, instead of 400 MB •  Exported options (i.e. parsers, accounts, levels, ...) can now be manually opened (ZIP format), modified, then re-ZIPPed and be imported back in LogMX (in previous versions, modifying the exported file prevented this file to be imported due to strict ZIP entries ordering) •  [Windows installer] In full installer (i.e. with Java included), now including Java 1.7.0\_u71 instead of Java 1.7.0\_u45 (for security reasons) •  Upgraded from JSch v0.1.49 + JZlib v1.1.1 to JSch v0.1.51 + JZlib v1.1.3 (library used for SCP/SFTP connections)  **Bugfixes:** •  Fixed a GUI freeze that could occur if a Manager took too long to respond •  [Log4j socket Appender] Fixed a compatibility issue with Log4j v1.2.13 and Log4j v1.2.14 that prevented LogMX to receive log events sent by these (old) Log4j versions (see [forum](forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1655)) •  When Auto-refresh was used on a merged file and one of the merged files was flushed, main log entries table might not be refreshed correctly •  Fixed a minor bug that occurred when selecting a LogMX file tab for which the file could not be loaded, while the "Find" window is displayed •  In the Parser creation wizard, the log entries table header displayed filter icons (like for main window entries table) but it should not •  Fixed typos and a bad link in API docs •  Fixed typos in License file    v5.2.x versions  v5.2.1 (October 23, 2014)  **New Features:** •  Can now read/monitor SFTP/FTP/FTPS directories thanks to new LogManagers (read/monitor all remote directory files, taking into account added/removed files) •  Can now export log entries to a file that can be re-imported later in LogMX (new export format based on legacy XML export, and added a Parser to read the exported XML files)  **Changes:** •  [FTP/FTPS] Better handling of session timeout when log file is not modified for a long time •  Can now start a Tail on merged files (on previous versions, files had to be merged, then Auto-refresh started ; can now use both "Tail" and "Merge" features directly from "Open log file" window) •  Can now monitor a merged file in Console mode •  When the SFTP/FTP file browsers ("Open file" window) are not displayed anymore, associated SFTP/FTP session is now closed (then re-opened when needed): it caused some issues with some servers limiting the number of active sessions per user •  When a merge operation is not supported (e.g. merge includes an export/search result, a local/remote directory), now displaying a nicer message that explicitly explains that this operation is not supported at this time, instead of a technical error message •  [API] Can now [remove a parameter from a LogURL](dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/business/LogURL.html#removeParameter(java.lang.String))  **Bugfixes:** •  On evaluation version, going to "Options" then applying some changes shortened the delay before the message "Eval version is over" was displayed •  In "Open log file" window, when choosing a host (e.g. for SFTP logs) in the combo box listing known hosts, the 'host' text field was not refreshed with this selected host (the host had to be selected a second time from the combo box to refresh the text field) •  Simple files (i.e. not Workspace/Bookmark) could not be monitored anymore in Console mode (regression) •  In Options, when listing Parsers, now hiding internal LogMX parsers (that cannot be used as Parsers) •  In Options, when listing Managers, now hiding internal LogMX managers (that cannot be used as Managers) •  With some merged files, "Activity" graph was empty (i.e. no log entry on the graph) •  When a date filter was used on merged files, the default date in date-picker was not the selected entry's date but the current date  v5.2.0 (September 25, 2014)  **New Features:** •  Can now read & parse compressed log files (zip/gzip/tar/bz2/lzma/xz) automatically and on-the-fly for all Managers (i.e local files, SFTP/SCP/FTP/FTPS/HTTP, ...) •  New TCP/UDP Socket Manager, supporting Log4j v1, Log4j v2, and Logback SocketAppender logs, as well as any other raw

allowing custom Managers to use compressed logs, live stream logs, and log entries extraction (yet, v1.2 is not mandatory, LogMX can still use v1.1 Managers)  **Changes:** •  When a filter is removed, now automatically focusing on the last selected log entry •  Can now remove several log levels at the same time in "Levels" tab of "Options" window •  By default, now parsing the 100 first lines of a log file before switching to another parser (instead of 50) •  Now handling a 32x32 icon for each Log Manager, now used in "Open file" dialog •  Levels slider redesigned •  [Windows .exe launcher] Now adding "lib/\*.jar" to classpath (easier to add JARs to classpath for custom Parsers/Managers, or Logback/Log4j deserialization for SocketManager)  **Bugfixes:** •  [Text search] When a text was found deep down a very long log message, all log entries were highlighted •  When the window "Add a new Log Manager" and then "Options" window were validated, the window "Add a new Log Manager" appeared again •  Fixed a bug that could prevent LogMX to start, in some cases, when a non-fatal error message was displayed (displaying this error message might then produce a fatal error) •  [AutoRefresh]

anymore using mouse drag, now fixed •  [AutoRefresh] When new log entries were received and entries limit was exceeded, currently selected entries were un-selected, and the view scrolled down automatically, but it should not •  When searching text in "Entry details" panel, the found text did not appear selected (highlighted) if this panel did not have the focus before opening the "Find" window •  When a user-defined field was used in a "Simple Parser", this field was replaced with a "UUID" field •  Some log files written by Log4j2 XMLLayout were not recognized as Log4j XML, so could not be parsed with built-in parser "Log4jXMLParser" •  When reading log files written by Log4j2 HTMLLayout, the built-in parser "Log4jHTMLParser" was not able to read "Emitter" and "Location" fields. •  Some log files using Syslog format could not be parsed using built-int Parser "SyslogParser" (RFC5424 with VERSION field) •  Now supporting log level names containing special characters like ",", "=", "[" (it used to produce errors during LogMX startup/exit when reading/writing user options) •  "File information" window did not report the right file tab title when this tab was renamed (the old name was displayed)  v5.1.1 (July 25, 2014)  **New Features:** •  Can now set main window always on top of all other desktop windows (via the new item in menu "Window")  **Changes:** •  Improved

entries to JSON format (among other current formats like XML, HTML, CSV, ...) •  [Pro version] Can now configure a list of external applications that can be started within LogMX (can give information to these applications, like current opened file and selected entry) •  Can now ignore log entries emitters through new option (useful for log formats without emitters to increase performances and decrease memory usage)  **Changes:** •  Improved file loading performances for files containing a large number of entries (reduced the time to process emitters tree, once loading progress reached 100%) •  On Mac, can now choose to use "Command/Meta" key (⌘) instead of "Ctrl" key for keyboard shortcuts (e.g. "⌘+C" to copy, "⌘+O" to open, ...) •  [API] New method available to Parsers:

versions  v5.0.0 (March 10, 2014)  **New Features:** •  Can now create a new type of Log Parsers: "Regex Parsers": A bit like Log4jPattern Parser but log format is described using Regular Expression (UNIX/Java/Perl/Python syntax). Handling optional text and ignoring fields is easier than with Log4jPattern Parser. •  Can now save and edit Tail & Alerts settings in bookmarks (when bookmarking a file, can save its current Tail/Autorefresh/Alerts settings in bookmark, so that these settings are always used when opening this bookmark in GUI mode or console mode) •  In "Open file" dialog, now using an automatic-completion editable combobox for "Login" and "Host" fields. A previously-used account (i.e. login@host) can be reused quickly, as for login only or host only. Text typed in "Login" and "Host" fields will be automatically completed if a match is found •  Can now export configured parser(s) to an external file, and import previously exported parser(s) from an external file (Java Class parsers files also embedded in export) •  Can now export bookmark(s) and workspace(s) to an external file, and import previously exported bookmark(s) and workspace(s) from an external file •  Can now rename file tabs (i.e. display any user-defined text instead of short file name) •  Added a shortcut to filter logs using a specific log entry attribute (e.g. level, message): simply click on the entries table column for this attribute, and a new filter will be setup for this attribute •  Can now use a toolbar button (or menu item) to quickly open a bookmarked file •  Can now increase/decrease log entries table font size using Ctrl+MouseWheel (table rows height will automatically be adjusted to always display the number of lines specified in user options) •  Added an option to display bookmark name in file tab, instead of short file name •  [API] A user-defined Java Class Parser can now declare if it handles fields "Level" and "Emitter", to improve detection/handling of incomplete entry parsing during AutoRefresh  **Changes:** •  Can now sort files (by name, size, date) displayed in "Open file" dialog browser (for SFTP/FTP/FTPS/...) •  File chooser UI improved: on Windows, using system icons. On Mac/Linux, using nicer icons than previously •  In Evaluation version, now allowing up to 10 files (instead of 3) to be displayed in remote file browser (SFTP/FTP/FTPS/...) •  [Console mode] Now handling logs monitoring of workspaces and bookmarks (i.e. can now use "--monitor" option with "workspace:" and "bookmark:" inputs) •  Replaced setting "Entries table row height" with "Lines of text per log entry", to choose exactly the number of lines of text to display in log entries table (table rows height now automatically adjusts depending on font size, to match this number of lines) •  For Log4jPattern parsers, now better detection/handling of incomplete entry parsing during AutoRefresh •  When opening a bookmarked file, can now edit this bookmark properties directly by clicking on the yellow star icon in the address bar •  Added a "Tail" option to read the whole file before tailing •  For all comboboxes used to select an encoding, now displaying most common encodings in the first place (with a quick description), before listing all available encodings •  Most text input controls in whole application now support undo/redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y) •  Now using icons for log entry fields when editing alerts/filters •  Can now compute elapsed time since log entry creation even if its date contains only day/month/year (assumed timestamp is 00:00:00) •  Can now remove several user accounts at the same time in "Options" > "Network" •  Improved file format description in main window status bar •  Help documents now opened in default system browser (fallback to legacy help viewer only if default browser cannot be used) •  Some graphical elements were improved in UI  **Bugfixes:** •  LogMX froze when trying to create a bookmark with a name used by an already existing bookmark •  When a file was opened directly in Tail/AutoRefresh mode and contained user-defined fields, these fields were not displayed until file was entirely refreshed •  Fixed a bug that could occur when opening a SFTP/FTP[S] file in Tail mode (tail failed) •  It is now possible to filter, by date, entries containing only day/month/year using a filter without hour/minute/second (i.e. only day/month/year in filter) •  In "Open file" dialog, using the Local file manager, if an absolute directory was typed in "file name" field, then pressing ENTER or clicking on OK made LogMX try opening this directory as a log file, instead of going to this directory in browser •  In some error message dialogs, some special characters were not displayed    v4.1.x versions  v4.1.3 (January 29, 2014)  **New Features:** •  Now also supporting RFC 5424 for syslogs (previous versions only support RFC 3164 syslogs, so for some OS's like Solaris 11, syslogs could not be parsed correctly by LogMX)  **Changes:** •  Improved graphical performances when scrolling log entries with Java 1.7.0\_u40 or later •  For syslogs format, now displaying the Facility name (e.g. "kernel messages", "log audit", "local0", ...) and not only its ID •  Added a start script "logmx.command" for easy startup on Mac •  On MacOS, now using LogMX icon in dock  **Bugfixes:** •  Using Java 7 update 40 or later, application froze for a few seconds the first time a tooltip was displayed (was due to [JDK bug #8024858](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8024858)). A fix was applied to avoid this bug. •  Fixed a regression from v4.1.2 that made the "Sort emitters" button buggy (did not work anymore) •  Fixed a bug that prevented some popup menu to be displayed on Mac (right-click on file tab and log entries table header) •  Fixed Linux/Mac start script: when starting LogMX from outside LogMX directory, the configuration file "startup.conf" was not used •  On UNIX/Linux/Mac, failed to start LogMX if its absolute path contained a whitespace character and if start script was called from outside LogMX directory •  Fixed a small graphical issue for files tabs gradient, with Java 1.7.0\_u40 or later  v4.1.2 (January 3, 2014)  **New Features:** •  When a log entry is selected, now always trying to focus on this entry when log level is changed (instead of going back to the first log entry in the entries table) •  Added a new connection setting for FTPS: "PROT" (can be set to "C", "S", "E", "P", or "NONE"), which is useful when the FTP server only accepts protected connections (eg: error message "PROT P required")  **Changes:** •  Now detecting and displaying FTP/FTPS errors when browsing FTP/FTPS sites •  Reduced processing time between the end of log file parsing and GUI readiness •  Now handling Premium license files (support/updates > 1 year) •  Internal logs for SCP/SFTP access could be confusing: they seemed to be tagged "SSH#i" for each connection, but they were not (JSch has only one Logger at a time for all connections)  **Bugfixes:** •  Eclipse RCP logs parser did not recognize some log entries begin (these entries were merged to previous entry's message) •  Changed keyboard accelerators for Bookmarks (Ctrl-K & Ctrl-Shift-K instead of Shift-B and Ctrl-Shift-B) to avoid triggering Bookmark action when typing character 'B' (using Shift-B) •  Fixed a bug that produced an error message (about timestamp format) on some occasions when interlacing log entries on merged files •  When an Alert was triggered, its link to original log entry did not work if file was a multiple-sources file (e.g. merged file or directory) •  When an already opened file was merged with other file(s), closing the first file could produce errors •  Fixed some display bugs in Emitters tree (some nodes height might be too big, or some nodes might not be displayed on some rare occasions) •  Toolbar buttons background was not painted

tab, can now copy to clipboard: file name, file path, and complete URL  **Changes:** •  Better support of multiple screens configurations (e.g. default windows position/size) •  For Log4jPattern parsers and Simple parsers, now allowing any number of whitespaces in date field where only one is expected (some log formats use fixed-length fields, so "MMM dd" must match both "Oct 11" and "Oct  5") •  In emitters tree, can now expand/collapse all tree nodes (and not just one recursively) with just one click (right-click on emitters panel empty space) •  [Parser API] New optional method [getVersionInfo()](dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/mgr/LogFileParser.html#getVersionInfo()) on Parser, to display some Parser versioning information in LogMX GUI •  Fixed a warning when compiling user-defined parsers/managers using Ant v1.9+ •  [Windows installer] In full installer (i.e. with Java included), now including Java 1.7.0\_u45 instead of Java 1.7.0\_u25 (for security reasons)  **Bugfixes:** •  When no suitable Parser could be found to read a log file, an error message appeared (NullPointerException) •  Fixed a table columns size settings issue: when saving columns state as default sizes, previous settings for user-defined fields were lost (now merging user-defined fields columns settings)  v4.1.0 (October 4, 2013)  **New Features:** •  New feature "Filtering state": can now quickly save & re-apply all filtering elements at once (i.e. shown/hidden levels, shown/hidden emitters, and applied filters) •  Can now customize main toolbar (each menu item can be added on toolbar, with any order, optional separator, and optional keyboard shortcut displayed) •  Can now freely resize any log entries table column, making this table horizontally scrollable (use SHIFT while resizing a column)  **Changes:** •  Can now cancel a file load with ESC key without having to switch to the tab that is currently loading •  Can now cancel a file load using a new dedicated button just in front of the loading progress bar (red button in main toolbar now only quits LogMX, it doesn't stop file loads anymore) •  Removed options "show classes" and "show classes count", and renamed "class" to "emitter" •  When reloading a file containing user-defined fields, now keeping user-defined fields columns settings (size, visibility) after reload (see [forum](forum/viewtopic.php?p=5415)) •  In "Network" options tab, can now sort user accounts by protocol, authentication method, or description •  In "Open file" dialog for non-local files, now displaying icons in "Login" field to indicate if a Password and/or Private Key is available for this account •  Can now maximize/restore entry details panel by double-clicking on its toolbar (or via the entry details panel contextual menu) •  [Windows Installer] Now providing an option to add a rule in Windows firewall to allow incoming/outgoing connections for LogMX (for remote logs access) •  [Windows Installer] Now embedding

Auto-refresh issue for some FTP servers •  If a valid password was presented in a file browser ("Open file" dialog) and the user checked the option "save password", the password was not saved (password was saved only when the file could be opened) •  Canceling a file load could take too long if no log entry was parsed yet •  When converting a pre-v4.0.1 bookmark for SCP/SFTP, the leading "/" character was missing in bookmark URL (see [forum](forum/viewtopic.php?p=5418))    v4.0.x versions  v4.0.2 (July 4, 2013)  **New Features:** •  "Open file" window now providing a FTP/FTPS file browser (similar to current SFTP file browser). *Note: a future [Manager Specification](dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/mgr/ManagerSpecVersion.html) will soon include "Browser" capabilities so that it would be possible for any Log Mananger to be used in this browser.*  **Changes:** •  During connections to SCP/SFTP servers, now number of authentication retries reduced to 2 (to prevent user account to be blocked in case of multiple authentication failures if server doesn't allow this) •  Windows installer now avoids a reboot during LogMX updates/reinstall if DLLs to update are identical to current ones (sorry, this new version comes with new DLLs) •  Internal LogMX logs can now be enabled (in startup config file) to ease technical support •  Windows Explorer shell extension now fully UNICODE (issues could be produced in Windows Explorer shell extension if LogMX was installed in a path containing non-ASCII character(s))  **Bugfixes:** •  Fixed a SFTP/SCP connection issue (regression in LogMX v3.0.1 which didn't send well-formed passwords when using "KeyboardInteractive" Authentication Method in some cases) •  "Export" window could not be displayed when trying to

the top or bottom of the list (thanks to the new popup menu using a right-click) •  Can now display bookmarks sorted by name and/or URL in "Bookmarks" window (see [forum](forum/viewtopic.php?p=5353)) •  On Windows, LogMX now runs as "LogMX.exe" (or "LogMX-64.exe") instead of "java.exe": can now distinguish LogMX from other Java applications (helpful in processes list, or to add firewall rules for this process). Note: "LogMX.exe" first tries to load LogMX in 32-bits mode, and if it fails and a suitable 64-bits JRE/JDK is found, then LogMX is started in 64-bits mode (whereas "LogMX-64.exe" only tries to start LogMX in 64-bits mode) •  When displaying all ClassPath entries for Parser/Manager addition, now expanding ClassPath entries like "dir/\*" to all JARs in directory "dir/"  **Bugfixes:** •  [Monitoring

merged files (monitor only the end of each file, merged in a single view) •  Now supporting Tail mode on local directory (monitor only the end of all files in a directory, merged in a single view) •  New feature "File information" that shows in a window all pieces of information about a file (can follow current file tab selection, and can be automatically refreshed upon file modification) •  New Search option (*"Use current selection"*) to go to the next or previous found entry from the current selected entry (useful, for example, when you want to see found entries from a given starting point) •  You can now switch Search options *"Wrap Search"* and *"Use current selection"* without performing a new search (both options can be changed in the "Search" status bar at the bottom of main window) •  Added a "Network" option to use Proxy system settings •  [API] New method

[LogFileManager.getShortFilename()](dev/api/com/lightysoft/logmx/mgr/LogFileManager.html#getShortFilename()) •  Fixed the "OutOfMemory" error message: now advising to modify "startup.conf" file to tune Xmx (and not ".bat", ".sh", or ".cfg" file) •  Now using Java 7 javadoc style for [LogMX API javadoc](dev/api/index.html) •  Now using hyperlinks to logmx website in displayed messages  **Bugfixes:** •  When using Auto-refresh on merged files, user-defined limit for number of log entries to display was ignored •  When exporting "found" entries, some entries could be exported several times if searched text was found several times in this entry •  Fixed an issue that prevented LogMX to load, in some cases, external libraries (to use SCP/SFTP, sounds, statistics charts, ...) •  Fixed an error that could occurred during a file refresh •  Fixed a crash in HTTPManager when releasing its resources without initializing it first •  Fixed links to Log4j Web documentation, in help

open workspaces and bookmarks using options *"workspace:"* and *"bookmark:"* in command line (works for both Graphical mode & Console mode) •  Added an option to force the reload of LogFileManager subclass before loading a log file with it (useful when writing your own LogFileManager since you don't have to restart LogMX each time you re-compile the Manager)  **Changes:** •  [API] Link to Java API updated (java.sun.com -> docs.oracle.com) •  [API] Added some details about "LogFileInfo" class and its expected date format  **Bugfixes:** •  When using Windows installer to upgrade to LogMX

See [forum](http://www.logmx.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=290). •  Some files could not be parsed if its first line was empty •  If LogMX started in command line using "LogMX.bat" from a directory different than LogMX directory, the settings file "startup.conf" was ignored •  With user-defined LogFileManager, URL parameters of type "BOOLEAN" didn't work well in the "Open file(s)" window

breaks, quotes, and field-separators within CSV fields (RFC4180) •  When using the calendar popup to pick a date/time, pressing ENTER while editing current timestamp now validates the calendar popup •  When using the calendar popup to pick a date/time, now using the currently selected log entry date as the default date for calendar popup •  Fixed display of file size in bytes (now using Kilo/Mega/Giga bytes with 1000 as factor, instead of 1024 -- conformity with International System of Units)  **Bugfixes:** •  Fixed an error preventing from loading a file in "raw-text" mode if file size > 2GB (load was OK if file used a known log format, i.e. not in "raw-text" mode) •  When using "flush file" feature just before enabling "auto-refresh" feature, user-defined fields were not displayed anymore (Refresh needed to restore these user-define fields) •  The help window displayed from the "Export" window was not enabled and could not be browsed until the "Export" window was closed.    v3.0.x versions  v3.0.2 (November 16, 2011)  **New Features:** •  Added methods to [LogMX API](dev/api/index.html) so that LogParsers and LogManagers can get information on opened log files

# The GUP generic update process in LogMX before 7.4.0 does not properly verify the authenticity of updates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse update.

The update check is performed over plaintext HTTP and a HTTP GET request is send:
<http://logmx.com/check_update.php?ver=v7.0.0&java=1.8.0_172&arch=amd64&os=win>

The response is a message that contains the latest version-number of the latest release and a change-log.
If a newer version is available, then a second HTTP GET request is performed:
<http://logmx.com/download_file.php?id=4&from=app>

This second request will fetch the new file over an unsecured channel.
Then the user is prompted with the change-log and the question if he wants to install this new update.

The update downloaded is a tgz file that contains the whole folder structure and that can be backdoor-ed since the download is performed over plaintext HTTP and there is no integrity and/or authenticity verification mechanism in place. Furthermore, under advanced options, the option to check for updates each week is activated by default.

The tar file needs to be decompressed:

tar -xzf LogMX\_v7.3.0.tgz

This will create a folder named LogMX\_v7.3.0\_eval that contains all files and folders related to the application.

The subfolder jar contains only one file logmx.jar. A jar-file is actually a zip file and when renamed to zip this file can be extracted. We can replace the LogMXUpdater.class with a malicious one since this file will be executed during the update.

To do so, you can use the attached file 'LogMXUpdater.java', of course you must change the LHOST and LPORT to match yours.

And compile this file to obtain a LogMXUpdater.class file:

javac LogMXUpdater.java

Replace the original LogMXUpdater.class file from the extracted jar file with our freshly compiled on and re-zip the files back into a logmx.zip file. Rename this file back to logmx.jar.

Recreate the tar file:

tar -czf LogMX\_update\_v7.3.0.tgz LogMX\_v7.1.0\_eval/

Ideally the malicious update should be delivered via a MITM-position such as ARP-poisoning or by a proxy. To simulate the behavior it is possible to replace the downloaded file on the machine before clicking on the Update LogMX-button. The downloaded tar-file is located at %APPDATA%\..\Local\Temp\LogMX\_Update and this file can be replaced to easily simulate the tampering with the file download.
