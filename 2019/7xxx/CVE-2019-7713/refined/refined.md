Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7713:

**CVE-2019-7713: Interpeak IPCOMShell Print Prompt Heap Overflow Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the IPCOMShell's prompt functionality. The shell allows users to customize the prompt using special modifiers that expand to dynamic information (like IP address, process name, process ID, or working directory). The function responsible for printing the prompt doesn't properly handle the expansion of these modifiers, which can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:**  When expanding custom modifiers in the prompt, the shell copies data to a buffer without adequate size checks. If the expanded data is larger than the allocated buffer on the heap, it causes a buffer overflow.
    *   **Information Leak:** The expansion of modifiers (e.g., printing process IDs) can also leak process address information to the user, which may be valuable to an attacker.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:**  A heap-based overflow can corrupt heap memory, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory corruption can cause the system to become unstable, resulting in a crash or denial of service.
    *   **Information Leak:** Leaked information, particularly address space information, can help attackers in further exploitation attempts.
    *   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a heap overflow could potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Undocumented Command:** The "prompt" command, which is used to set the custom prompt, is an undocumented feature of IPCOMShell.
    *   **User-Controlled Input:**  The attacker controls the content of the prompt string, including the modifiers that are expanded, providing control of data written during the overflow.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to IPCOMShell:** The attacker must have access to the IPCOMShell interface. This typically requires some level of access to the embedded system running INTEGRITY RTOS.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the IPCOMShell "prompt" command due to improper handling of prompt modifiers. This can lead to memory corruption, DoS, information leaks, and possibly arbitrary code execution. Exploitation requires access to the IPCOMShell and the ability to execute the prompt command.
