- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/system/maintenance/export.php` file does not properly validate user input provided through the `name` parameter, which leads to path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated attacker can read arbitrary local files on the system. This leads to information disclosure and potential privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/system/maintenance/export.php` with the `type` parameter set to `isp` and the `name` parameter containing a path traversal sequence (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the affected Systrome Cumilon ISG devices.
