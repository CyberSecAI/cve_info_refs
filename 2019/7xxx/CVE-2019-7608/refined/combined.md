# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).

**Kibana XSS issue (ESA-2019-01)**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7608

---

**Kibana Timelion Remote Code Execution issue (ESA-2019-02)**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the Timelion visualizer. An attacker with access to the Timelion application could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15. Users unable to upgrade can disable Timelion by setting timelion.enabled to false in the kibana.yml configuration file.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7609

---

**Kibana audit logging Remote Code Execution issue (ESA-2019-03)**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the security audit logger. If a Kibana instance has the setting xpack.security.audit.enabled set to true, an attacker could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15. User unable to upgrade can set the xpack.security.audit.enabled setting to false in the kibana.yml configuration file if it is currently set to true. The setting defaults to false if not specified in the configuration file.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7610

---

**Elasticsearch improper permission issue when attaching a new name to an index (ESA-2019-04)**

A permission issue was found in Elasticsearch when Field Level Security and Document Level Security are disabled and the \_aliases, \_shrink, or \_split endpoints are used . If the elasticsearch.yml file has xpack.security.dls\_fls.enabled set to false, certain permission checks are skipped when users perform one of the actions mentioned above, to make existing data available under a new index/alias name. This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index.

**Affected Versions**

Elasticsearch Security versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Elasticsearch version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15. Users unable to upgrade can change the xpack.security.dls\_fls.enabled setting to true in their elasticsearch.yml file. The default setting for this option is true.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7611

---

**Logstash sensitive data disclosure issue (ESA-2019-05)**

A sensitive data disclosure flaw was found in the way Logstash logs malformed URLs. If a malformed URL is specified as part of the Logstash configuration, the credentials for the URL could be inadvertently logged as part of the error message.

**Affected Versions**

Logstash versions before 6.6.1 and 5.6.15

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Elasticsearch version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7612

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-04-04 03:47:15 UTC  ``` Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the security audit logger. If a Kibana instance has the setting xpack.security.audit.enabled set to true, an attacker could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.  References:  <https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-6-1-and-5-6-15-security-update/169077>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c10)  Jason Shepherd    2019-09-26 06:23:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0/9.0 Operational Tools Kibana/Elasticsearch versions do not include nor support X-Pack (8/9 versions must use the optional Shield, also not packaged); not affected.  Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, and 3.x do not install the vulnerable package (Shield for Kibana 4, and X-Pack for Kibana 5), so the impact is lowered to moderate.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-27 01:35:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1  Via RHSA-2019:2860 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2860](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2860)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c13)  Eric Christensen    2020-04-29 14:16:36 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-6-1-and-5-6-15-security-update/169077>   ``` |  |
