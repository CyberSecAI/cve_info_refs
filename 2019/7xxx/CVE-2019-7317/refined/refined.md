Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-7317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the `png_image_free` function within the libpng library. This occurs because the `png_image_free_function` is called without proper safeguards in `png.c` of libpng library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free: Memory is freed and then accessed, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.
- Improper handling of a malformed image during the freeing of image resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malformed PNG image can crash the application utilizing libpng, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential Arbitrary Code Execution: An exploitable crash due to the use-after-free can, in some cases, be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- Possible sandbox escape on Windows due to a race condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing of a specially crafted (malformed) PNG image file, either locally or remotely, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to entice a user or an automated system into processing a malicious PNG file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in libpng versions prior to 1.6.37.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the freeing of image resources (`png_image_free` function).
- The vulnerability impacts several applications, including web browsers (Firefox, Thunderbird).
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by a malicious website using a canvas object.
- Some systems are also vulnerable via processing a malformed image locally.
- Fixes are provided in updated versions of libpng and associated applications, such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird, and the IBM Java SE runtime environment.
- The use-after-free is located in `png.c`, specifically within `png_image_free` which calls `png_safe_execute(image, png_image_free_function, image)`. When the result of png_safe_execute is not 0, the image is freed, but a pointer `image->opaque->error_buf` is then accessed directly after that, resulting in a use-after-free.
- In addition to the use-after-free vulnerability, a memory leak in the ARM NEON implementation of `png_do_expand_palette` and a memory leak in `pngtest.c` are also patched as part of the same update.
- Several different vendors and projects address this issue, indicating that it is a common vulnerability across different software stacks.
