Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of user-supplied data when parsing charstrings within PostScript files. Specifically, the lack of validation leads to a read operation that goes beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which allows an attacker to access memory locations beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The immediate impact is the disclosure of sensitive information. This is achieved by reading data outside the intended memory region.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** While this vulnerability itself leads to information disclosure, it's stated that it "can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process." This implies that this vulnerability could be a stepping stone in a chain of attacks to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PostScript File:**  An attacker can craft a malicious PostScript file designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read during parsing.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability requires user interaction, either by opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page that loads such a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious PostScript file to the target.
*   They need to entice the user to open the file or otherwise process it with a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Acrobat Pro DC.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2019-03-08, and the coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2019-05-15.
*   The vulnerability is assigned CVSS score of 3.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
*   The vulnerability is also present in other Adobe products, including Acrobat Reader DC, Acrobat 2017 and Acrobat Reader 2017
