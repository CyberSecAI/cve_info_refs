## 1. Overview:

Avaya Aura® Conferencing is an on-premise collaboration solution that provides audio, HD video, and web collaboration capabilities. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Web application UI of Avaya Aura Conferencing may allow code execution and potentially disclose sensitive information. This issue has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (cve.mitre.org) identifier [CVE-2019-7000](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7000).

Avaya would like to thank Ammarit Thongthua and Nattakit Intarasorn for finding and reporting this issue.

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected packages installed:

For assessment and severity classification details refer to Section 3 of [Avaya's Product Vulnerability Response Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100045520).
The "Resolution" column will be updated as fixes are made available. Please reference the "Information" column for any additional information regarding the affected product.

| Product: | Version(s): | Resolution: | Information: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Conferencing | 8.0 thru 8.0 SP13 | Upgrade to 8.0 SP14 or later. | See [Avaya Aura Conferencing 8.0 SP14 Release Notes](https://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/101058552) for details. Prior versions not listed were not evaluated. |

**Recommended Actions for Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends following networking and
security best practices by implementing firewalls, ACLs,
physical security or other appropriate access restrictions.
Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in
place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network
from this potential vulnerability may be mitigated by
ensuring these practices are implemented until such time as
an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya
action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but the System Product operating system or
application should not be modified unless the change is
approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved may
void the Avaya product service contract.

### CVSS 3.0 Scoring and Metrics:

Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3
(CVSSv3) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSSv3 base score and metrics. Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSSv3 scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment. For more information on CVSS and how the score is calculated, see
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.0: Specification Document](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document).

| Vulnerability | CVSSv3 Base Score | CVSSv3 Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2019-7000](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7000) | 5.9 (Medium) | [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N) |
