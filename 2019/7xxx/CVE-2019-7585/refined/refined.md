Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `checkemail` function of the `PublicAction.class.php` file. This function directly incorporates user-provided input into an SQL query without any filtering. Specifically, the `$_POST["param"]` value, meant to be an email, is directly used in the WHERE clause of the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection. By crafting a specific payload, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query. The vulnerability is exploitable because the `useremail` field is not properly sanitized and is concatenated into a raw SQL query.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The SQL injection is blind, meaning the attacker doesn't receive direct feedback from the database. Instead, the attacker exploits the `sleep()` function to infer if their injected SQL logic is true, by observing delays in response times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including but not limited to user passwords (or password hashes), usernames, and other potentially confidential information. The provided exploit demonstrates retrieval of the admin's password hash.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full compromise of the application, allowing the attacker to create new accounts, alter user data, or escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to the `index.php?m=public&a=checkemail` endpoint, with a malicious payload crafted within the `param` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Understanding of SQL and Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and the concept of time-based blind SQL injection to construct the malicious payload.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet (PHP):**
    ```php
    //邮箱重复验证
    Public function checkemail(){
        $Member=M('Members');
        $data['useremail']=$_POST["param"];
        $reuseremail=$Member->where($data)->select();
        if(empty($reuseremail)) {
            echo '{
                "info":"",
                "status":"y"
             }';
        }
        else{
            echo '{
                "info":"该邮箱已注册，请更换其他邮箱！",
                "status":"n"
             }';
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Example Exploit Payload:**
    The provided exploit uses a Python script to demonstrate how to retrieve the admin password hash by injecting a malicious query that utilizes the `sleep()` function. The script iteratively guesses each character of the hash based on response times.
    The following payload is used:
    ```
    "param[0]": "exp",
    "param[1]": "and if ((select userpass from sn_members \
                            where username=0x61646d696e and userpass like BINARY '{}%'),sleep(2),1)"
    ```
*   **Resulting SQL Query:** The injected payload results in a modified query similar to this:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM `sn_members` WHERE (  (`useremail` and sleep(5))  )
    ```
    or this when using the exploit
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM `sn_members` WHERE (  (`useremail` and if ((select userpass from sn_members where username=0x61646d696e and userpass like BINARY 'a%'),sleep(2),1))  )
    ```
