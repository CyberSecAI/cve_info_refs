CVE-2019-7610:
- Vulnerability: Arbitrary code execution flaw
- Root cause: The vulnerability exists in the security audit logger of Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1.
- Attack vector: If a Kibana instance has the setting xpack.security.audit.enabled set to true, an attacker could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code.
- Impact: This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with the permissions of the Kibana process on the host system, leading to data confidentiality and integrity issues as well as system availability.
- Mitigation: Upgrade to Kibana version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15. If unable to upgrade, set the xpack.security.audit.enabled setting to false in the kibana.yml configuration file if it is currently set to true. The setting defaults to false if not specified in the configuration file.
