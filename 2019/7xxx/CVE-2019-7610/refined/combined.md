# Security issues

## Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure

Elastic values our partnership with the security community and shares the goal of keeping our users and the internet safe. Please report potential security vulnerabilities affecting any of Elastic's products, the Elastic Cloud Service, or the elastic.co website via our [HackerOne bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/elastic?type=team). For detailed scope and rules of engagement please refer to our HackerOne program [policy](https://hackerone.com/elastic?view_policy=true).

Under the principles of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Elastic analyzes potential security vulnerabilities to identify any recommended mitigations or product updates and coordinates disclosures via Elastic Security Advisories (ESA) and the CVE program. Elastic requests that you do not post or share any information about potential vulnerabilities in any public forum until we have researched and responded to the issue.

## Other security issues

Users and customers may report any other potential security issues to security@elastic.co. This address can be used for product security related inquiries or requests about other security topics that are not explicitly mentioned here. We can accept only security issues at this address. Bug reports should be directed to the bug database of the project you're reporting it on or raised to Elastic Support.

If you would like to encrypt your message to us, please use our PGP key. The fingerprint is

1224 D1A5 72A7 3755 B61A 377B 14D6 5EE0 D2AE 61D2

The key is available via keyservers; search for 'security@elastic.co'. [Example on OpenPGP](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=security%40elastic.co)

## Elastic Security Advisories

An Elastic Security Advisory (ESA) is an announcement about a security issue with one or more Elastic products. Elastic assigns a CVE and an ESA identifier to each advisory and publishes a summary of the issue with remediation and mitigation details. All new advisories are announced in the [Security Announcements](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements) forum. Subscribe to these announcements by clicking the bell icon and selecting 'Watching' on the forum page or, alternatively, via the [RSS feed](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/announcements/security-announcements.rss).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-04-04 03:47:15 UTC  ``` Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the security audit logger. If a Kibana instance has the setting xpack.security.audit.enabled set to true, an attacker could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.  References:  <https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-6-1-and-5-6-15-security-update/169077>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c10)  Jason Shepherd    2019-09-26 06:23:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8.0/9.0 Operational Tools Kibana/Elasticsearch versions do not include nor support X-Pack (8/9 versions must use the optional Shield, also not packaged); not affected.  Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, and 3.x do not install the vulnerable package (Shield for Kibana 4, and X-Pack for Kibana 5), so the impact is lowered to moderate.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-27 01:35:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1  Via RHSA-2019:2860 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2860](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2860)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1696032#c13)  Eric Christensen    2020-04-29 14:16:36 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-6-1-and-5-6-15-security-update/169077>   ``` |  |

**Kibana XSS issue (ESA-2019-01)**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 had a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from or perform destructive actions on behalf of other Kibana users.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7608

---

**Kibana Timelion Remote Code Execution issue (ESA-2019-02)**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the Timelion visualizer. An attacker with access to the Timelion application could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15. Users unable to upgrade can disable Timelion by setting timelion.enabled to false in the kibana.yml configuration file.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7609

---

**Kibana audit logging Remote Code Execution issue (ESA-2019-03)**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the security audit logger. If a Kibana instance has the setting xpack.security.audit.enabled set to true, an attacker could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.

**Affected Versions**

Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Kibana version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15. User unable to upgrade can set the xpack.security.audit.enabled setting to false in the kibana.yml configuration file if it is currently set to true. The setting defaults to false if not specified in the configuration file.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7610

---

**Elasticsearch improper permission issue when attaching a new name to an index (ESA-2019-04)**

A permission issue was found in Elasticsearch when Field Level Security and Document Level Security are disabled and the \_aliases, \_shrink, or \_split endpoints are used . If the elasticsearch.yml file has xpack.security.dls\_fls.enabled set to false, certain permission checks are skipped when users perform one of the actions mentioned above, to make existing data available under a new index/alias name. This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index.

**Affected Versions**

Elasticsearch Security versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Elasticsearch version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15. Users unable to upgrade can change the xpack.security.dls\_fls.enabled setting to true in their elasticsearch.yml file. The default setting for this option is true.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7611

---

**Logstash sensitive data disclosure issue (ESA-2019-05)**

A sensitive data disclosure flaw was found in the way Logstash logs malformed URLs. If a malformed URL is specified as part of the Logstash configuration, the credentials for the URL could be inadvertently logged as part of the error message.

**Affected Versions**

Logstash versions before 6.6.1 and 5.6.15

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Users should upgrade to Elasticsearch version 6.6.1 or 5.6.15

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7612
