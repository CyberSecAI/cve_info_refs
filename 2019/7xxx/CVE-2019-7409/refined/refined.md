- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple input parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to malicious actions within the context of the user's browser session such as session hijacking, defacement or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs with specific parameters such as `page`, `gbs`, `side`, `id`, `imgid`, `cat`, or `orderby`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user of the vulnerable application.
