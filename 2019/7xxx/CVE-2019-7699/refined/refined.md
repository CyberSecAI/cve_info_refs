- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `AP4_BitStream::WriteBytes` function due to insufficient bounds checking when writing data to a bitstream.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A crafted input can cause a segment fault, leading to a denial-of-service. The vulnerability could potentially be leveraged for more severe impacts, such as arbitrary code execution if the overflow overwrites critical data on the heap.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted input file using the `avcinfo` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to the `avcinfo` tool.
