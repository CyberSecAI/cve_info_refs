- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of images within PostScript files, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. The attacker can potentially leverage this vulnerability along with others to execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: User interaction is required, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a crafted PostScript file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious file or webpage to the victim, and the victim has to interact with the malicious content.
