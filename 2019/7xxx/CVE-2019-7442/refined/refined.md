  - Root cause of vulnerability: The XML parser of the SAML authentication system of the Password Vault Web Access (PVWA) is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted DTD.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.
  - Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can disclose sensitive information or potentially bypass the authentication system.
  - Attack vectors: By sending a crafted XML payload to the vulnerable component (https://example.com/PasswordVault/auth/saml) via the SAMLResponse argument.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: No user interaction or privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered in pre-authentication.
