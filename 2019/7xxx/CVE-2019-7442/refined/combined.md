#### Seamless & secure access for all identities

By combining secure SSO, Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Directory Services and User Behavior Analytics, we help you streamline operations and give users simple and secure access to resources—on-premises, cloud, hybrid—from any location, using any device.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-2.svg)

#### Intelligent privilege controls

Apply world-class intelligent privilege controls across the IT estate, as well as differentiated controls to secure the unique needs of workforce users, third-party vendors, endpoints and machine identities as they access sensitive data.

![](https://www.cyberark.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/overview-img-3.svg)

#### Flexible identity automation & orchestration

Streamline HR processes, ensure users have the right access to the right resources, enable compliance with industry or government regulations, and improve efficiencies across the board with orchestration and lifecycle management, permissions and entitlements, and directory and federation services.

### Identity Security Defined
