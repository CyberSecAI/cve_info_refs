#### SUCCESS STORIES

## What Our Clients Say

Out of the gate our experience with TrustFoundry was very positive. They did their own scoping research, and not having to coordinate our testing between sales and the testers saved valuable time. This is a highly experienced team that has proven themselves time and time again.

![Travis, CISO](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/plugins/testimonial-builder/assets/images/test.png)

### Travis, CISO

5 of 5 overall satisfaction

We wanted a vendor that had experience with Fortune 500 companies, and is quick to address our concerns and questions. In TrustFoundry we found a partner that was organized, had deep expertise, and was able to clearly explain everything that an organization from small to large would need.

![Jug, CTO](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/plugins/testimonial-builder/assets/images/test.png)

### Jug, CTO

5 of 5 overall satisfaction

Trust Foundry is vital to our ongoing security and compliance efforts to protect our applications and networks. Their ability to simulate real-world attack scenarios and perform comprehensive testing helps to identify security weaknesses that other teams can miss.

![David, VP of Information Security](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/plugins/testimonial-builder/assets/images/test.png)

### David, VP of Information Security

5 of 5 overall satisfaction

Professional and knowledgeable team; great communication; reporting is awesome; always responsive; and really strong technical skills. I trust that they have conducted thorough pentests and feel confident in the results.

### Andy, Director of Information Security

TrustFoundry's communication top to bottom is hands down the best we've had from any partner we have used. This saved us a lot of frustration and time, but most importantly the results were exactly what we needed.

### Alev, Compliance Manger

5 of 5 overall satisfaction

We have worked with other pentesting firms that ran scans and outputted a report with little manual exploit effort, explanations or understanding. TrustFoundry walked us through their processes and was able to intelligently speak to the risk and impact for each finding.

![Christy, Senior Information Security Engineer](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/plugins/testimonial-builder/assets/images/test.png)

### Christy, Senior Information Security Engineer

5 of 5 overall satisfaction

Great communication, technical knowledge was awesome, integrated to our team seamlessly. We had a few different vendors who were not necessarily responsive, and did not have an in-depth penetration testing capability.

### Scott, CTO

5 of 5 overall satisfaction

The quality of the work, findings, and reporting was phenomenal. The high level of communication and service really helped us stay on track and within our budget. We will be returning in the future as we develop our environment.

### Michael, Founder & CEO

5 of 5 overall satisfaction

```
                  Jonathan Wisdom  2022-04-11    The team at TrustFoundry was incredibly easy to work with throughout our entire life cycle of our engagement.  Every team member was very responsive and collaboration was quick/easy when questions or issues were identified.

The final report delivered by their team surpassed what we'd hoped to gain through a pro-active security assessment.  I plan on recommending their services to my peers whenever the age old "who do you use for external assessments" question arises in the future.              Stephen Reddekopp  2021-11-04    TrustFoundry was fantastic to work with. They understood our system and were able to take our specific business requirements into consideration for tailored test plans. They were always quick to communicate. The final report was easy to understand and included examples of how to replicate any findings. They were very thorough in their testing and explanations.              Alfredo Hickman  2021-10-28    It was a pleasure working with TrustFoundry. TrustFoundry did top-quality work during our penetration testing engagement. I particularly valued the quality security findings and that they provided date/time stamps for their tests, which enabled me to verify my security visibility and detections. I highly recommend TrustFoundry for your security testing initiatives.              Devin Ingersoll  2021-08-20    They are dedicated to improving your overall security stance anyway they can! Great team to work with!              Christy VanderPloeg  2021-08-04    The TrustFoundry pentest team was a pleasure to work with. Their penetration testing team is top notch! During testing we were provided weekly status reports and escalations of critical findings. The reports were easy to read and understand. Upon completion of testing the TF team walked us through each finding to ensure we understood the exploit, risk and impact to our business. I would recommend them!              Eric Goeken  2021-01-05    What an impressive bunch to work with. They took a quick brief and went to work. When they were done, they provided a clean easy to read doc, without a bunch of noise.

# CVE-2019-7629: RCE in an Open Source MUD Client

A few weeks ago I took the [Corelan Advanced](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced/) class and when I came back, I started poking at some open source projects that I personally use. It was a great exercise and I ultimately ended up with my first [CVE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7629). I was a little disappointed I didn’t get to use any of my newly acquired heap exploitation skills, but I was still thrilled to find a remotely exploitable 0-day in an open source project.

## What is a MUD?

For those of you who don’t know, MUDs (short for “Multi-User Dungeon” or “Multi-User Domain”) were the precursors to modern day massively multiplayer online RPGs such as World of Warcraft. Most MUDs were 100% text-based and could be played using Telnet or a number of custom clients. Players would log in and create a character, roleplay with other players, slay monsters, and complete quests.

Login screen for Legends of the Jedi MUD, one of my personal favorites

Third-party clients, such as WinTin++ shown above, offer several benefits over the standard Telnet client, such as support for scripting, colored text, macros, and other features that make it more convenient to play the game. WinTin++ in particular has a ton of features and happens to be written in C, so it looked like a great first target for my vulnerability research. Turns out I was right!

## Triggering the Stack Overflow

I considered patching the TinTin++/WinTin++ source so I could fuzz it with [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/), but it didn’t turn out to be necessary since I found the first crash after about 5 minutes of manual testing. Here is the Python code used to trigger the crash:

import time
from pwn import \*
buf = ""
buf += "A" \* 60000
while True:
    l = listen(4000)
    \_ = l.wait\_for\_connection()
    time.sleep(2)
    l.sendline(buf)

| 123456789101112 | import timefrom pwn import \* buf = ""buf += "A" \* 60000 while True:    l = listen(4000)    \_ = l.wait\_for\_connection()    time.sleep(2)     l.sendline(buf) |
| --- | --- |

In short, we set up a malicious MUD server on port 4000 and send 60,000 “A”s to WinTin++ after it connects. I’m using a Windows 7 SP1 machine and WinTin++ 2.01.6, which was the latest official version at the time. Here is the crash on the Windows client:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/first_crash.png)

First crash with 60,000 A’s

We can see in WinDBG that the crash happened because we tried to dereference 0x41414179, which is obviously an invalid address. We have clearly corrupted something, and using “kb” to print the callstack shows thousands of A’s instead of valid function addresses, so it looks like a basic stack overflow. To help us develop our exploit, let’s use [mona.py](https://github.com/corelan/mona) to look at loaded modules and see if WinTin++ is taking advantage of ASLR and other optional exploit mitigations:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mona-modules.png)

Output of mona’s modules command

We can see that WinTin++ and the cygwin1.dll library that ships with it were compiled without ASLR, and since DEP is opt-in by default on Windows 7, we won’t have to bypass any exploit mitigations to exploit this vulnerability.

## Finding the Offset

Looking at the crash, we can see that the application tries to read from an address that was clobbered by our stack overflow and thus terminates with an illegal memory access error. We have overwritten the saved return pointer at EBP, so we will have control of execution once the vulnerable functions returns.

To get started, we’ll use mona to generate a cyclic pattern so we can calculate the offset of our saved return pointer:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pattern-create.png)

We then replace our buffer of A’s in the payload with the cyclic pattern and trigger the crash again. The register state now looks like this:

eax=21684f5f ebx=00000000 ecx=0026c034 edx=00000028 esi=00000000 edi=00000000

## The Vulnerability

Now that we have the offset of EBP, let’s stop and take a look at the source code to see if we can figure out what is going on that causes the crash in the first place. I used the address of the instruction we are crashing at to locate the function in Binary Ninja. I discovered that the application is crashing in parse.c: do\_one\_line():

parse.c
C

void do\_one\_line(char \*line, struct session \*ses)
{
    char strip[BUFFER\_SIZE]; // BUFFER\_SIZE is 32000
    push\_call("[%s] do\_one\_line(%s)",ses->name,line);
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_IGNORELINE))
    {
        pop\_call();
        return;
    }
    strip\_vt102\_codes(line, strip);
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_ACTION]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_actions(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_PROMPT]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_prompts(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_GAG]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_gags(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_SUBSTITUTE]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_substitutions(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_HIGHLIGHT]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_highlights(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_LOGNEXT))
    {
        logit(ses, line, ses->lognext\_file, TRUE);
        DEL\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_LOGNEXT);
    }
    pop\_call();
    return;
}

“do\_one\_line” takes the MUD output (char \*line), creates another buffer of 32,000 bytes on the stack, and passes both buffers to “strip\_vt102\_codes”. The problem here is that \*line can be up to 64,000 bytes, as shown in the calling function “process\_mud\_output”:

net.c

void process\_mud\_output(struct session \*ses, char \*linebuf, int prompt)
{
    char line[STRING\_SIZE]; // STRING\_SIZE is 64000
    push\_call("process\_mud\_output(%p,%p,%d)",ses,linebuf,prompt);
    ses->check\_output = 0;
    strip\_vt102\_codes(linebuf, line);
    check\_all\_events(ses, SUB\_ARG|SUB\_SEC, 0, 2, "RECEIVED LINE", linebuf, line);
    if (prompt)
    {
        check\_all\_events(ses, SUB\_ARG|SUB\_SEC, 0, 2, "RECEIVED PROMPT", linebuf, line);
    }
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_COLORPATCH))
    {
        sprintf(line, "%s%s%s", ses->color, linebuf, "\e[0m");
        get\_color\_codes(ses->color, linebuf, ses->color);
        linebuf = line;
    }
    do\_one\_line(linebuf, ses); /\* changes linebuf \*/

| --- | --- |

Furthermore, if we look at strip\_vt102\_codes, it does not check the size of either buffer:

vt102.c
C

void strip\_vt102\_codes(char \*str, char \*buf)
{
    char \*pti, \*pto;
    pti = (char \*) str;
    pto = (char \*) buf;
    while (\*pti)
    {
        while (skip\_vt102\_codes(pti))
        {
            pti += skip\_vt102\_codes(pti);
        }
        if (\*pti)
        {
            \*pto++ = \*pti++;
        }
    }
    \*pto = 0;
}

| 123456789101112131415161718192021 | void strip\_vt102\_codes(char \*str, char \*buf){    char \*pti, \*pto;     pti = (char \*) str;    pto = (char \*) buf;     while (\*pti)    {        while (skip\_vt102\_codes(pti))        {            pti += skip\_vt102\_codes(pti);        }         if (\*pti)        {            \*pto++ = \*pti++;        }    }    \*pto = 0;} |
| --- | --- |

So, when the raw MUD output being parsed (\*line) is greater than the size of the stripped buffer, we overflow the stripped buffer and start smashing the stack in the caller. Note that we aren’t overwriting strip\_vt\_102\_codes’ return address, even though that’s where the out-of-bounds write happens. \*buf is declared in do\_one\_line, and \*pto simply points to it. Because of this, we are overwriting one function’s return address from another function.

“skip\_vt102\_codes” strips out VT102 escape codes from the buffer before copying it, which originally caused a lot of problems for me when I was trying to call functions in the bundled cygwin1.dll module, since the base address included valid VT102 codes. Another issue that tripped me up for longer than I would like to admit is that we have to null terminate our buffer to exit the while loop in strip\_vt102\_codes. This must be done so we don’t start clobbering the stack values being checked in the if (!HAS\_BIT) statements in do\_one\_line and segfault before reaching the end of the function.

## Finishing the Exploit

Now that we understand the vulnerability, it’s time to build our exploit. We’re going to send 33432 bytes of junk + our shellcode, followed by an address pointing into our nopsled, followed by a null byte. Fortunately, the base address in the tt++ module starts with a null byte, which takes care of null-terminating our buffer and exiting the strip\_vt102\_codes loop right when we need to. The final exploit looks like this:

And we see our lovely calculator:

Calc.exe proof-of-concept

Note, I did not bother to bypass ASLR and DEP–the application did not opt-in to either of them, so it wasn’t necessary on Windows 7. In theory, ASLR should be trivial to bypass as the application saves function addresses and their corresponding arguments at the beginning of each function to provide debugging information in the event of a crash. If you can find the address in the debug stack, you should have all you need to defeat ASLR. DEP is a little trickier since both the tt++.exe and cygwin1.dll modules have null bytes or VT102 code sequences in their base addresses, so building a ROP chain without mangling and prematurely terminating your buffer could prove difficult.

I contacted the developer, who responded immediately and pushed a fix within a matter of hours.

# CVE-2019-7629: RCE in an Open Source MUD Client

A few weeks ago I took the [Corelan Advanced](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced/) class and when I came back, I started poking at some open source projects that I personally use. It was a great exercise and I ultimately ended up with my first [CVE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7629). I was a little disappointed I didn’t get to use any of my newly acquired heap exploitation skills, but I was still thrilled to find a remotely exploitable 0-day in an open source project.

## What is a MUD?

For those of you who don’t know, MUDs (short for “Multi-User Dungeon” or “Multi-User Domain”) were the precursors to modern day massively multiplayer online RPGs such as World of Warcraft. Most MUDs were 100% text-based and could be played using Telnet or a number of custom clients. Players would log in and create a character, roleplay with other players, slay monsters, and complete quests.

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lotj-splash-1.png)

Login screen for Legends of the Jedi MUD, one of my personal favorites

Third-party clients, such as WinTin++ shown above, offer several benefits over the standard Telnet client, such as support for scripting, colored text, macros, and other features that make it more convenient to play the game. WinTin++ in particular has a ton of features and happens to be written in C, so it looked like a great first target for my vulnerability research. Turns out I was right!

## Triggering the Stack Overflow

I considered patching the TinTin++/WinTin++ source so I could fuzz it with [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/), but it didn’t turn out to be necessary since I found the first crash after about 5 minutes of manual testing. Here is the Python code used to trigger the crash:

import time
from pwn import \*
buf = ""
buf += "A" \* 60000
while True:
    l = listen(4000)
    \_ = l.wait\_for\_connection()
    time.sleep(2)
    l.sendline(buf)

| 123456789101112 | import timefrom pwn import \* buf = ""buf += "A" \* 60000 while True:    l = listen(4000)    \_ = l.wait\_for\_connection()    time.sleep(2)     l.sendline(buf) |
| --- | --- |

In short, we set up a malicious MUD server on port 4000 and send 60,000 “A”s to WinTin++ after it connects. I’m using a Windows 7 SP1 machine and WinTin++ 2.01.6, which was the latest official version at the time. Here is the crash on the Windows client:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/first_crash.png)

First crash with 60,000 A’s

We can see in WinDBG that the crash happened because we tried to dereference 0x41414179, which is obviously an invalid address. We have clearly corrupted something, and using “kb” to print the callstack shows thousands of A’s instead of valid function addresses, so it looks like a basic stack overflow. To help us develop our exploit, let’s use [mona.py](https://github.com/corelan/mona) to look at loaded modules and see if WinTin++ is taking advantage of ASLR and other optional exploit mitigations:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mona-modules.png)

Output of mona’s modules command

We can see that WinTin++ and the cygwin1.dll library that ships with it were compiled without ASLR, and since DEP is opt-in by default on Windows 7, we won’t have to bypass any exploit mitigations to exploit this vulnerability.

## Finding the Offset

Looking at the crash, we can see that the application tries to read from an address that was clobbered by our stack overflow and thus terminates with an illegal memory access error. We have overwritten the saved return pointer at EBP, so we will have control of execution once the vulnerable functions returns.

To get started, we’ll use mona to generate a cyclic pattern so we can calculate the offset of our saved return pointer:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pattern-create.png)

We then replace our buffer of A’s in the payload with the cyclic pattern and trigger the crash again. The register state now looks like this:

eax=21684f5f ebx=00000000 ecx=0026c034 edx=00000028 esi=00000000 edi=00000000

## The Vulnerability

Now that we have the offset of EBP, let’s stop and take a look at the source code to see if we can figure out what is going on that causes the crash in the first place. I used the address of the instruction we are crashing at to locate the function in Binary Ninja. I discovered that the application is crashing in parse.c: do\_one\_line():

parse.c
C

void do\_one\_line(char \*line, struct session \*ses)
{
    char strip[BUFFER\_SIZE]; // BUFFER\_SIZE is 32000
    push\_call("[%s] do\_one\_line(%s)",ses->name,line);
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_IGNORELINE))
    {
        pop\_call();
        return;
    }
    strip\_vt102\_codes(line, strip);
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_ACTION]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_actions(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_PROMPT]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_prompts(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_GAG]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_gags(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_SUBSTITUTE]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_substitutions(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_HIGHLIGHT]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_highlights(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_LOGNEXT))
    {
        logit(ses, line, ses->lognext\_file, TRUE);
        DEL\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_LOGNEXT);
    }
    pop\_call();
    return;
}

“do\_one\_line” takes the MUD output (char \*line), creates another buffer of 32,000 bytes on the stack, and passes both buffers to “strip\_vt102\_codes”. The problem here is that \*line can be up to 64,000 bytes, as shown in the calling function “process\_mud\_output”:

net.c

void process\_mud\_output(struct session \*ses, char \*linebuf, int prompt)
{
    char line[STRING\_SIZE]; // STRING\_SIZE is 64000
    push\_call("process\_mud\_output(%p,%p,%d)",ses,linebuf,prompt);
    ses->check\_output = 0;
    strip\_vt102\_codes(linebuf, line);
    check\_all\_events(ses, SUB\_ARG|SUB\_SEC, 0, 2, "RECEIVED LINE", linebuf, line);
    if (prompt)
    {
        check\_all\_events(ses, SUB\_ARG|SUB\_SEC, 0, 2, "RECEIVED PROMPT", linebuf, line);
    }
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_COLORPATCH))
    {
        sprintf(line, "%s%s%s", ses->color, linebuf, "\e[0m");
        get\_color\_codes(ses->color, linebuf, ses->color);
        linebuf = line;
    }
    do\_one\_line(linebuf, ses); /\* changes linebuf \*/

| --- | --- |

Furthermore, if we look at strip\_vt102\_codes, it does not check the size of either buffer:

vt102.c
C

void strip\_vt102\_codes(char \*str, char \*buf)
{
    char \*pti, \*pto;
    pti = (char \*) str;
    pto = (char \*) buf;
    while (\*pti)
    {
        while (skip\_vt102\_codes(pti))
        {
            pti += skip\_vt102\_codes(pti);
        }
        if (\*pti)
        {
            \*pto++ = \*pti++;
        }
    }
    \*pto = 0;
}

| 123456789101112131415161718192021 | void strip\_vt102\_codes(char \*str, char \*buf){    char \*pti, \*pto;     pti = (char \*) str;    pto = (char \*) buf;     while (\*pti)    {        while (skip\_vt102\_codes(pti))        {            pti += skip\_vt102\_codes(pti);        }         if (\*pti)        {            \*pto++ = \*pti++;        }    }    \*pto = 0;} |
| --- | --- |

So, when the raw MUD output being parsed (\*line) is greater than the size of the stripped buffer, we overflow the stripped buffer and start smashing the stack in the caller. Note that we aren’t overwriting strip\_vt\_102\_codes’ return address, even though that’s where the out-of-bounds write happens. \*buf is declared in do\_one\_line, and \*pto simply points to it. Because of this, we are overwriting one function’s return address from another function.

“skip\_vt102\_codes” strips out VT102 escape codes from the buffer before copying it, which originally caused a lot of problems for me when I was trying to call functions in the bundled cygwin1.dll module, since the base address included valid VT102 codes. Another issue that tripped me up for longer than I would like to admit is that we have to null terminate our buffer to exit the while loop in strip\_vt102\_codes. This must be done so we don’t start clobbering the stack values being checked in the if (!HAS\_BIT) statements in do\_one\_line and segfault before reaching the end of the function.

## Finishing the Exploit

Now that we understand the vulnerability, it’s time to build our exploit. We’re going to send 33432 bytes of junk + our shellcode, followed by an address pointing into our nopsled, followed by a null byte. Fortunately, the base address in the tt++ module starts with a null byte, which takes care of null-terminating our buffer and exiting the strip\_vt102\_codes loop right when we need to. The final exploit looks like this:

Calc.exe proof-of-concept

Note, I did not bother to bypass ASLR and DEP–the application did not opt-in to either of them, so it wasn’t necessary on Windows 7. In theory, ASLR should be trivial to bypass as the application saves function addresses and their corresponding arguments at the beginning of each function to provide debugging information in the event of a crash. If you can find the address in the debug stack, you should have all you need to defeat ASLR. DEP is a little trickier since both the tt++.exe and cygwin1.dll modules have null bytes or VT102 code sequences in their base addresses, so building a ROP chain without mangling and prematurely terminating your buffer could prove difficult.

I contacted the developer, who responded immediately and pushed a fix within a matter of hours.

# CVE-2019-7629: RCE in an Open Source MUD Client

By [Nick Fox](https://trustfoundry.net/author/nick-fox/ "Posts by Nick Fox")February 18, 2019October 5th, 2022[No Comments](https://trustfoundry.net/2019/02/18/cve-2019-7629-rce-in-an-open-source-mud-client/#respond)

[Home](https://trustfoundry.net/) » CVE-2019-7629: RCE in an Open Source MUD Client

# CVE-2019-7629: RCE in an Open Source MUD Client

A few weeks ago I took the [Corelan Advanced](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced/) class and when I came back, I started poking at some open source projects that I personally use. It was a great exercise and I ultimately ended up with my first [CVE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7629). I was a little disappointed I didn’t get to use any of my newly acquired heap exploitation skills, but I was still thrilled to find a remotely exploitable 0-day in an open source project.

## What is a MUD?

For those of you who don’t know, MUDs (short for “Multi-User Dungeon” or “Multi-User Domain”) were the precursors to modern day massively multiplayer online RPGs such as World of Warcraft. Most MUDs were 100% text-based and could be played using Telnet or a number of custom clients. Players would log in and create a character, roleplay with other players, slay monsters, and complete quests.

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lotj-splash-1.png)

Login screen for Legends of the Jedi MUD, one of my personal favorites

Third-party clients, such as WinTin++ shown above, offer several benefits over the standard Telnet client, such as support for scripting, colored text, macros, and other features that make it more convenient to play the game. WinTin++ in particular has a ton of features and happens to be written in C, so it looked like a great first target for my vulnerability research. Turns out I was right!

## Triggering the Stack Overflow

I considered patching the TinTin++/WinTin++ source so I could fuzz it with [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/), but it didn’t turn out to be necessary since I found the first crash after about 5 minutes of manual testing. Here is the Python code used to trigger the crash:

import time
from pwn import \*
buf = ""
buf += "A" \* 60000
while True:
    l = listen(4000)
    \_ = l.wait\_for\_connection()
    time.sleep(2)
    l.sendline(buf)

| 123456789101112 | import timefrom pwn import \* buf = ""buf += "A" \* 60000 while True:    l = listen(4000)    \_ = l.wait\_for\_connection()    time.sleep(2)     l.sendline(buf) |
| --- | --- |

In short, we set up a malicious MUD server on port 4000 and send 60,000 “A”s to WinTin++ after it connects. I’m using a Windows 7 SP1 machine and WinTin++ 2.01.6, which was the latest official version at the time. Here is the crash on the Windows client:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/first_crash.png)

First crash with 60,000 A’s

We can see in WinDBG that the crash happened because we tried to dereference 0x41414179, which is obviously an invalid address. We have clearly corrupted something, and using “kb” to print the callstack shows thousands of A’s instead of valid function addresses, so it looks like a basic stack overflow. To help us develop our exploit, let’s use [mona.py](https://github.com/corelan/mona) to look at loaded modules and see if WinTin++ is taking advantage of ASLR and other optional exploit mitigations:

![](https://trustfoundry.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mona-modules.png)

Output of mona’s modules command

We can see that WinTin++ and the cygwin1.dll library that ships with it were compiled without ASLR, and since DEP is opt-in by default on Windows 7, we won’t have to bypass any exploit mitigations to exploit this vulnerability.

## Finding the Offset

Looking at the crash, we can see that the application tries to read from an address that was clobbered by our stack overflow and thus terminates with an illegal memory access error. We have overwritten the saved return pointer at EBP, so we will have control of execution once the vulnerable functions returns.

To get started, we’ll use mona to generate a cyclic pattern so we can calculate the offset of our saved return pointer:

We then replace our buffer of A’s in the payload with the cyclic pattern and trigger the crash again. The register state now looks like this:

## The Vulnerability

Now that we have the offset of EBP, let’s stop and take a look at the source code to see if we can figure out what is going on that causes the crash in the first place. I used the address of the instruction we are crashing at to locate the function in Binary Ninja. I discovered that the application is crashing in parse.c: do\_one\_line():

parse.c
C

void do\_one\_line(char \*line, struct session \*ses)
{
    char strip[BUFFER\_SIZE]; // BUFFER\_SIZE is 32000
    push\_call("[%s] do\_one\_line(%s)",ses->name,line);
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_IGNORELINE))
    {
        pop\_call();
        return;
    }
    strip\_vt102\_codes(line, strip);
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_ACTION]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_actions(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_PROMPT]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_prompts(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_GAG]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_gags(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_SUBSTITUTE]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_substitutions(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (!HAS\_BIT(ses->list[LIST\_HIGHLIGHT]->flags, LIST\_FLAG\_IGNORE))
    {
        check\_all\_highlights(ses, line, strip);
    }
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_LOGNEXT))
    {
        logit(ses, line, ses->lognext\_file, TRUE);
        DEL\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_LOGNEXT);
    }
    pop\_call();
    return;
}

“do\_one\_line” takes the MUD output (char \*line), creates another buffer of 32,000 bytes on the stack, and passes both buffers to “strip\_vt102\_codes”. The problem here is that \*line can be up to 64,000 bytes, as shown in the calling function “process\_mud\_output”:

net.c

void process\_mud\_output(struct session \*ses, char \*linebuf, int prompt)
{
    char line[STRING\_SIZE]; // STRING\_SIZE is 64000
    push\_call("process\_mud\_output(%p,%p,%d)",ses,linebuf,prompt);
    ses->check\_output = 0;
    strip\_vt102\_codes(linebuf, line);
    check\_all\_events(ses, SUB\_ARG|SUB\_SEC, 0, 2, "RECEIVED LINE", linebuf, line);
    if (prompt)
    {
        check\_all\_events(ses, SUB\_ARG|SUB\_SEC, 0, 2, "RECEIVED PROMPT", linebuf, line);
    }
    if (HAS\_BIT(ses->flags, SES\_FLAG\_COLORPATCH))
    {
        sprintf(line, "%s%s%s", ses->color, linebuf, "\e[0m");
        get\_color\_codes(ses->color, linebuf, ses->color);
        linebuf = line;
    }
    do\_one\_line(linebuf, ses); /\* changes linebuf \*/

| --- | --- |

Furthermore, if we look at strip\_vt102\_codes, it does not check the size of either buffer:

vt102.c
C

void strip\_vt102\_codes(char \*str, char \*buf)
{
    char \*pti, \*pto;
    pti = (char \*) str;
    pto = (char \*) buf;
    while (\*pti)
    {
        while (skip\_vt102\_codes(pti))
        {
            pti += skip\_vt102\_codes(pti);
        }
        if (\*pti)
        {
            \*pto++ = \*pti++;
        }
    }
    \*pto = 0;
}

| 123456789101112131415161718192021 | void strip\_vt102\_codes(char \*str, char \*buf){    char \*pti, \*pto;     pti = (char \*) str;    pto = (char \*) buf;     while (\*pti)    {        while (skip\_vt102\_codes(pti))        {            pti += skip\_vt102\_codes(pti);        }         if (\*pti)        {            \*pto++ = \*pti++;        }    }    \*pto = 0;} |
| --- | --- |

So, when the raw MUD output being parsed (\*line) is greater than the size of the stripped buffer, we overflow the stripped buffer and start smashing the stack in the caller. Note that we aren’t overwriting strip\_vt\_102\_codes’ return address, even though that’s where the out-of-bounds write happens. \*buf is declared in do\_one\_line, and \*pto simply points to it. Because of this, we are overwriting one function’s return address from another function.

“skip\_vt102\_codes” strips out VT102 escape codes from the buffer before copying it, which originally caused a lot of problems for me when I was trying to call functions in the bundled cygwin1.dll module, since the base address included valid VT102 codes. Another issue that tripped me up for longer than I would like to admit is that we have to null terminate our buffer to exit the while loop in strip\_vt102\_codes. This must be done so we don’t start clobbering the stack values being checked in the if (!HAS\_BIT) statements in do\_one\_line and segfault before reaching the end of the function.

## Finishing the Exploit

Now that we understand the vulnerability, it’s time to build our exploit. We’re going to send 33432 bytes of junk + our shellcode, followed by an address pointing into our nopsled, followed by a null byte. Fortunately, the base address in the tt++ module starts with a null byte, which takes care of null-terminating our buffer and exiting the strip\_vt102\_codes loop right when we need to. The final exploit looks like this:

Calc.exe proof-of-concept

Note, I did not bother to bypass ASLR and DEP–the application did not opt-in to either of them, so it wasn’t necessary on Windows 7. In theory, ASLR should be trivial to bypass as the application saves function addresses and their corresponding arguments at the beginning of each function to provide debugging information in the event of a crash. If you can find the address in the debug stack, you should have all you need to defeat ASLR. DEP is a little trickier since both the tt++.exe and cygwin1.dll modules have null bytes or VT102 code sequences in their base addresses, so building a ROP chain without mangling and prematurely terminating your buffer could prove difficult.

I contacted the developer, who responded immediately and pushed a fix within a matter of hours.
