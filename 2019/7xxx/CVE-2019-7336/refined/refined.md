Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper output sanitization in the `_monitor_filters.php` file. The application takes user-provided input for the `MonitorName` and `Source` parameters and stores it in the session. This stored data is then displayed in the application without any output filtering or escaping, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is injected through the `MonitorName` and `Source` parameters, stored, and executed in the user's browser when the page is viewed.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Output Encoding:** The vulnerability arises due to a failure to sanitize user input before storing it in the session and a failure to encode or escape output before displaying it in the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that can be executed in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Data theft:** Attackers can potentially steal session cookies, access sensitive data, or redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Account compromise:** Attackers could potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Website defacement:** The injected code can modify the appearance of the webpage.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing a malicious payload in the `MonitorName` and `Source` parameters, and then tricks a user to access this URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Attacker capability:**  An attacker needs the ability to craft and deliver a URL to a user, or inject the malicious input in the affected fields through other means.
- **Attacker position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated as the application stores the values even without a session. The attacker needs to be able to get a user to click the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable file is `_monitor_filters.php`.
- The specific vulnerable parameters are `MonitorName` and `Source`.
- The vulnerable application is ZoneMinder v1.33.1.
- The provided payload example is: `"><img src=x onerror-prompt('1');>`. This demonstrates a simple XSS attack using an `onerror` event.
- The issue was reported by Loginsoft-Research.
