The provided content is related to CVE-2019-7153.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `WasmBinaryBuilder::getFunctionIndexName(unsigned int)` function within `wasm/wasm-binary.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code attempts to access a memory location using a pointer that is null.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The null pointer dereference leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program to crash. This can be triggered by a malicious wasm input, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted WASM input: A specifically crafted WebAssembly file can trigger the vulnerability when processed by `wasm-opt`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious WebAssembly file to the vulnerable binaryen tool (`wasm-opt`).
