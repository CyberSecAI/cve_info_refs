# Access to pipelines and jobs via API although feature disabled

**[HackerOne report #448115](https://hackerone.com/reports/448115)** by xanbanx on 2018-11-21:

Hi GitLab security team,

GitLab supports CI/CD by means of pipelines containing build jobs. However, if users do not need this features, project owner can disable this feature under `https://mygitlab.com/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/edit#js-shared-permissions`. While this disables the frontend of these features, the corresponding API still gives access to pipelines and jobs.

## Steps to reproduce

Tested on GitLab 11.5.0 RC13

1. Create a project, add some code such that a CI pipeline runs
2. Under `https://mygitlab.com/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;project-name&gt;/edit#js-shared-permissions` disable the CI pipelines
3. Perform the following API request:

```
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: &lt;MY-TOKEN&gt;" "https://mygitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/&lt;project-id&gt;/pipelines"
```

This returns the past pipelines for the project. Similar to that also `GET /projects/:id/pipelines/:pipeline_id` succeeds. Also job information can be queried via `GET /projects/:id/jobs` or `GET /projects/:id/pipelines/:pipeline_id/jobs`

## Impact

It allows users to get access to previous build information, which feature should be disabled.
