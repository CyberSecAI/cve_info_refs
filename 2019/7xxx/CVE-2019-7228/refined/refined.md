- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ABB IDAL HTTP server does not properly handle user-supplied format strings during the authentication process. Specifically, the username and cookie strings are not sanitized before being used in format string operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled format string vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause memory corruption, bypass authentication, or execute arbitrary code on the server. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can use format string specifiers to read memory contents.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP interface of the IDAL server. Specifically, it is triggered when handling the username and cookie parameters during the login process. An attacker could send crafted HTTP requests to the login endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. The attack can be performed remotely if the server is exposed. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
