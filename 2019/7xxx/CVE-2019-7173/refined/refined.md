- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input before rendering it on the "Attachment" page, specifically the `Title` field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the vulnerable page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious payload through the `Title` field in the admin panel and then when another user views the `attachments` page, the stored XSS will execute in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access or the ability to edit attachment metadata. They can achieve this by being an authenticated user with the appropriate permissions, or exploiting another vulnerability which could grant them the needed access.
