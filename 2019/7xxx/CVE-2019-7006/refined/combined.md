Important Notes

Video SRTP configuration on one-X Communicator:
By default, Avaya one-X® Communicator 6.2 release onwards has Video SRTP enabled on Best Effort basis,
so no need to update any configuration to support this feature. Video would be SRTP enabled only when
TLS is selected for login over SIP – This Computer mode.

The following are the default settings:

6

ENFORCE_SIPS_URI = 1
SDPCAPNEG = 1
MEDIAENCRYPTION = 1,2,9

It  is  recommended  to  keep  SRTP  settings  on  Best  Effort  on  the  Aura  components  as  well  like
Communication Manager, Session Border Controller, Avaya Aura Conferencing and also on other clients
and endpoints.

Video SRTP is supported only in SIP – This Computer mode in environment having Avaya Aura 6.2 FP3 or
later / AAC 7.2 FP2 or later. With Avaya Aura 6.2 FP2, video would be supported on RTP only.

Table below shows audio and video support over SRTP or RTP for different user types and login modes  -

SIP Shared Control:
Make  sure,  the  parameter  “SET  ENABLE_PPM_SOURCED_SIPPROXYSRVR”  is  always  set  to  1  in
46xxsettings file for all 96x1 SIP phones.

Also, the SM server FQDNs / IPs (primary and secondary) should be listed in same order on both Avaya
one-X®  Communicator  and  96x1  SIP  desk  phone  for  successful  login  and  working  of  Avaya  one-X®
Communicator in Shared Control mode (Reference ID: ONEXC-5270)

7

The value of SIPREGPROXYPOLICY should be set to Simultaneous in 46xxsetttings file for 96x1 SIP phones
as  Alternate  registration  policy  is  not  supported  for  Shared  Control  operation  (Reference  ID:  ONEXC-
12596)

Avaya one-X® Communicator Login / PPM download with Avaya Aura Session Manager 6.2 FP4:
Avaya Aura Session Manager 6.2 FP4 and beyond will no longer have the "demo" certificates installed by
default with new installations. This does not affect SM upgrades, as all existing certificates are preserved
through the upgrade process.

All new installs will, by default, use SIP and HTTP certificates signed by System Manager.  Careful planning
should  be  done  to  ensure  all  endpoints  (soft  clients  and  devices)  are  similarly  equipped  with  System
Manger signed certificates. Else existing TLS connections will no longer function.

For connecting Avaya one-X® Communicator 6.2 SP13 with Session Manager 6.2 FP4 (or later) new install,
please ensure that either SMGR MGMT certificate is installed and trusted by Avaya one-X® Communicator
user’s machine or the demo certificate is installed on SM.

Using the SM command line, “initTM” is available to install the "demo" certificates in either of the
following ways:

# initTM –d
OR
# initTM –demo

Note: to assist in viewing certificate status, new information has been added to the status available on
System Manager under: Home > Elements > Session Manager > System Status > Security Module Status.
