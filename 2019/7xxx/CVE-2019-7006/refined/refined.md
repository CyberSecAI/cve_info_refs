Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-7006

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Avaya one-X Communicator client uses weak cryptographic algorithms in its authentication component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Usage of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- User credentials could be decrypted by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could decrypt user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the user's communication services.
- The vulnerability could allow unauthorized access and potential compromise of communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the client authentication component.
- The specific attack vector is not mentioned, however, the CVSS metric indicates local access with high complexity and user interaction required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have local access to the affected system or be in a position to intercept traffic, which requires user interaction (UI:R) to be successfully exploited.
- The attacker needs to have high level of expertise to exploit this (AC:H)

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that Avaya one-X® Communicator should only be used for existing environments where H.323 is necessary.  It is recommended that customers migrate to Avaya Equinox® for all other cases.
-  The advisory credits Werner Schober (SEC Consult) for reporting the issue.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to upgrade to Avaya one-X® Communicator 6.2 SP13 or later.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.5 (Medium)
- CVSSv3 Metrics: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L
