Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is **Improper Authorization**. Specifically, the exacqVision Enterprise System Manager (ESM) grants excessive permissions to directories by default to authorized, low-privilege system accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The system grants more privileges than necessary to low-privilege system accounts, which is the core vulnerability. This is a configuration issue where the default permissions are not restrictive enough.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage the excessive permissions to modify application files, inject malicious code, and gain control over the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially escalate their privileges by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires local access to the system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker would need to manipulate files within the directories that have excessive permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a foothold on the system.
*   **Low-Privilege Account:**  The attacker would initially need a low-privilege system account on the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **High Skill Level:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires a high level of skill.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** exacqVision ESM v5.12.2 and prior, affecting all Microsoft Windows operating systems except for Microsoft Windows Server.
*   **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   **Mitigation:** Johnson Controls recommends upgrading to the latest product, Version 19.03.
