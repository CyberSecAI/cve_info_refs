- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the `Title` field on the Vocabulary page before displaying it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not escape user input, allowing malicious scripts to be stored and executed when a page displaying the title is accessed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they visit a page that displays the malicious title. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the page, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code, such as `<img src=xss onerror=alert(1)>`.
  - The attacker submits this payload in the `Title` field of a new vocabulary entry via the admin interface.
  - When another user views the list of vocabularies on the admin page, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to have access to the admin interface where they can add or modify vocabulary entries.
  - The attacker does not need to interact directly with the victim but requires the victim to visit a page where the malicious code is rendered.
