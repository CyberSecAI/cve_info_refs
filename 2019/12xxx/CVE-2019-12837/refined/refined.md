The provided content is related to CVE-2019-12837.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient security checks on API endpoints. Specifically, a security check intended to prevent unauthorized access to student data could be bypassed by simply adding a trailing slash to the API endpoint URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate input validation/sanitization: The API failed to properly handle URLs with trailing slashes, allowing the bypass of security checks.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference: The API allows direct access to student data by specifying the student ID in the URL (e.g. /estudiants/1218208/), without proper authorization checks to ensure the requester is authorized to view the requested user's data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to personal and sensitive information of thousands of students registered on the platform.
- Data leakage including birthdays, home addresses, email addresses, DNIs, and phone numbers.
- Programmatic data harvesting, potentially leading to identity theft or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable API endpoints with a trailing slash.
- Specifically, requests to endpoints such as `/accesuniversitat/accesuniversitat-rs/AppJava/api/v1/estudiants/1218208/` and `/accesuniversitat/accesuniversitat-rs/AppJava/api/v1/estudiants/?page={page}` are vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to obtain a valid authentication token by logging into the platform as a student.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the API, which can be achieved using tools like `curl`.
- No special network access or privileged account is needed beyond a regular student account.
