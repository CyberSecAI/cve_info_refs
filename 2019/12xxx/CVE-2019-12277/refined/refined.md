{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The commit introduces sanitization for file paths and names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. The code changes in `StringExtensions.cs` add `SanitizePath` and `SanitizeFileName` extensions that throw an exception if the path contains `..` or `//` or the file name contains `..`, `//`, or more than one dot. Additionally, the StorageService.cs file has changes to sanitize the file name and path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Before this commit, the application was vulnerable to path traversal vulnerabilities due to the lack of sanitization of file paths and names. This could allow an attacker to access or modify files outside the intended directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially read, write, or modify files on the server that they should not have access to, leading to information disclosure, data corruption, or unauthorized access to the system. Depending on the affected files, this could lead to anything from minor to catastrophic damage.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could manipulate file paths or file names in API calls to access or modify files outside the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to make requests to the API endpoints that involve file paths or names, and would need to have some understanding of the application's file system structure."
