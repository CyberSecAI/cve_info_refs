### [Works great](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-great-5648/)

Just installed on Wordpress 5.1 to replace Crayon and had no problems, especially with Crayon compatibility enabled.
It does require a little work to clean up minor formatting problems caused by the switch, but that’s generally not a problem. It is also missing a few languages that Crayon has, but highlight.js is fairly configurable in that regard.

Great job! The UI is a little rudimentary but you’ve done a great job in a nice clean implementation of the highlight.js library in Wordpress. Congrats!

I used to use Crayon Syntax Highlighter and is awesome too, but wp-code-highlightjs is better for my site and loads faster.

I’m so pleased I finally found a plugin that did exactly what I wanted. I tried a number of other syntax highlighting plugins, and they all fell short in one way or another. Thanks so much for this!
