Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12779:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure creation of temporary files by the `libqb` library for inter-process communication (IPC). The library creates temporary files in world-writable directories like `/dev/shm` and `/tmp` with predictable filenames. Additionally, the `O_EXCL` flag is not used when opening these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Predictable Filenames:** The library generates predictable filenames when creating temporary files in shared memory and temp directories. This makes it easy for an attacker to predict the name and location of the temporary file
*   **Lack of `O_EXCL` flag:** The library does not use the `O_EXCL` flag when creating these temporary files. This flag is important to ensure exclusive file creation and prevent race conditions.
*   **World-Writable Directories:** Temporary files are created in world-writable directories such as `/dev/shm` and `/tmp`, which allows any user to read, write and create files in these directories

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link (symlink) with the same predictable name in the same directory as the temporary file used by libqb before the temporary file is created. Due to the lack of `O_EXCL`, libqb will then open or write to the file pointed by the symlink, potentially overwriting arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the application linked against `libqb`.
*   This could potentially lead to system compromise as the overwritten files could be privileged system files.
*   In the context of cluster management, an attacker could potentially cause a denial of service or gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the application using `libqb` is running.
*   **Race Condition:** Exploitation relies on a race condition where the attacker creates the symlink before the application creates the temporary file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Basic File System Knowledge:** The attacker must understand how symbolic links work to create the symlink.
*   **Timing:** The attacker must be able to time their attack to occur before the application creates the temporary file.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in `libqb` version 1.0.5, which uses `mkdtemp` to create temporary directories.
*   Patches released use `O_EXCL` flag and `mkdtemp` for more secure IPC files.
*   Multiple sources confirm the same root cause and vulnerability with slight variations in their explanation.

This vulnerability can be considered high in severity since it allows for a local user to potentially gain system compromise.
