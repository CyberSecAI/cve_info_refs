# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

[`bb97970`](/zeek/zeek/commit/bb979702cf9a2fa67b8d1a1c7f88d0b56c6af104)

This is a **security patch release** to address potential Denial of

Service vulnerabilities:

* Integer type mismatches in BinPAC-generated parser code and Bro

  analyzer code may allow for crafted packet data to cause

  unintentional code paths in the analysis logic to be taken due to

  unsafe integer conversions causing the parser and analysis logic

  to each expect different fields to have been parsed. One such

  example, reported by Maksim Shudrak, causes the Kerberos analyzer

  to dereference a null pointer. [CVE-2019-12175](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m47c-xm2p-2v99 "CVE-2019-12175") was assigned for

  this issue.
* The Kerberos parser allows for several fields to be left

  uninitialized, but they were not marked with an &optional attribute

  and several usages lacked existence checks. Crafted packet data

  could potentially cause an attempt to access such uninitialized

  fields, generate a runtime error/exception, and leak memory.

  Existence checks and &optional attributes have been added to the

  relevent Kerberos fields.
* BinPAC-generated protocol parsers commonly contain fields whose

  length is derived from other packet input, and for those that allow

  for incremental parsing, BinPAC did not impose a limit on how

  large such a field could grow, allowing for remotely-controlled

  packet data to cause growth of BinPAC's flowbuffer bounded only

  by the numeric limit of an unsigned 64-bit integer, leading

  to memory exhaustion. There is now a generalized limit for

  how large flowbuffers are allowed to grow, tunable by setting

  "BinPAC::flowbuffer\_capacity\_max".
