Based on the provided content, here's information related to the identified vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Xiaomi M365 electric scooter is vulnerable to unauthorized control via Bluetooth communication. The scooter does not properly implement authentication, allowing commands to be executed without a password.
*   **Root Cause:** The password for the scooter is only validated on the application side and the scooter itself doesn't keep track of the authentication state.
*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers can exploit the Bluetooth communication channel to send commands to the scooter within a 100-meter range.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: Attackers can remotely lock any M365 scooter.
    *   Malware Deployment: Attackers can install malicious firmware to gain full control over the scooter.
    *   Targeted Attacks: Attackers can target individual riders, causing the scooter to suddenly brake or accelerate.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Attackers need to be within Bluetooth range (up to 100 meters) of the scooter and have the ability to craft and send malicious Bluetooth payloads.
*   **Mitigation:** Connecting to the scooter with the official Xiaomi application before riding and keeping the mobile device connected can prevent remote attacks.
