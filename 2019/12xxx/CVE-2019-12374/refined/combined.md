# [CVE-2019-12374] LANDesk Management Server - SQL Injection

#### SQL Injection vulnerability found in LDMS 10.0.1.168 Service Update 5 due to improper username sanitization.

May 25, 2019

A SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in the web API endpoint located at https://<coreserver>/landesk/managementsuite/core/provisioning.secure/ProvisioningSecure.asmx.

This vulnerability is present within the Provisioning.Secure.dll utilized by this API endpoint. If we decompile this DLL, the vulnerability can be clearly seen within 2 methods.

Provisioning.Secure.ProvUserValidator.UsernameExists(string strUserName)
![Provisioning.Secure.ProvUserValidator.UsernameExists.png](/media/images/Provisioning.Secure.ProvUserValidator.UsernameE.original.png)
Provisioning.Secure.ProvUserValidator.GetUserIdn(string strUserName)
![Provisioning.Secure.ProvuserValidator.GetUserIdn.png](/media/images/Provisioning.Secure.ProvuserValidator.GetUserId.original.png)

This vulnerability is partially mitigated by the protections provided by IIS authentication. In most cases, only valid usernames can get through. However, these restrictions are not infallible. If the IIS server is improperly configured (i.e. anonymous authentication is allowed, other authentication methods are disabled), or if a specially crafted username is created, an attacker could leverage this condition to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the LANDesk server.

To confirm this, I first created a user named "username' or '1'='1". I then created a Python script to authenticate to the endpoint using Basic HTTP authentication. This script generated the following HTTP request.

```

POST /landesk/managementsuite/core/provisioning.secure/ProvisioningSecure.asmx?op=CheckCredentials
server <coreserver>
content-type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Authorization: Basic bGl0dGxlYm9iYnl0YWJsZXMnIE9SICcxJz0nMTpodHRwczovL3hrY2QuY29tLzMyNy8=
Content-Length: 278

<soap12:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:soap12="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
  <soap12:Body>
    <CheckCredentials xmlns="http://tempuri.org/" />
  </soap12:Body>
</soap12:Envelope>

```

When received, the server first grabs the Authorization HTTP header. It then base64 decodes the string, and passes it into the username validation method. The username validation method passes the username through both vulnerable methods, executing the injected SQL statement twice.

The vendor has been notified of this vulnerability, and confirmed that LDMS version 10.0.1.168 SU 5 is no longer supported. Thus, this vulnerability will not be patched.

# LANDesk Management Server - Multiple Vulnerabilities

#### Multiple vulnerabilities of varying severity have been identified in LDMS 10.0.1.168 Service Update 5

May 25, 2019

The vendor has been notified of these vulnerabilities. This version is no longer being actively developed (end of life 12/31/2018), so these vulnerabilities will not be patched. However, fixes will be released for supported versions where applicable. These vulnerabilities affect the following LDMS modules:

* Managed endpoint security settings
* Provisioning
* Endpoint encryption / Mac file vault / Device Adminsitration
* Device Inventory / Vulnerability Management

These vulnerabilities range in severity from inconsequential to critical, and some can be used together to gain full administrative control of the LDMS server and/or a full takeover of managed endpoints.

A list of weaknesses found is as follows:

* [(CWE-284) Improper Access Control](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)
* [(CWE-213) Intentional Information Disclosure](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/213.html)
* [(CWE-548) Information Exposure through Directory Listing](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/548.html)
* [(CWE-434) Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)
* [(CWE-89) Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* [(CWE-327) Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)
* [(CWE-261) Weak Cryptography for Passwords](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/261.html)
* [(CWE-321) Use of a Hard-coded Cryptographic Key](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)
* **Additional unpublished weaknesses\***

A list of confirmed vulnerabilities derived from those weaknesses is as follows:

* [[CVE-2019-12375] LANDesk Management Server - Open Directories](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-open-directories/)
* [[CVE-2019-12373] LANDesk Management Server - Administrator Password Disclosure](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-administrator-password-disclosure/)
* [[CVE-2019-12377] LANDesk Management Server - Arbitrary File Upload](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-arbitrary-file-upload/)
* [[CVE-2019-12376] LANDesk Management Server - Hard-coded Encryption Key](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-hard-coded-encryption-key/)
* [[CVE-2019-12374] LANDesk Management Server - SQL Injection](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-sql-injection/)
* **Additional unpublished vulnerabilities\***

*\*At least one additional vulnerability is confirmed to affect newer versions of LDMS. I will not publish these vulnerabilities until the vendor confirms that they have been patched.*
