# Javascript Injection in six Android mail clients

February 15, 2020 · 2 min · 340 words · Luigi Gubello

During last spring (2019) I started to “open and read” the Android applications before installing them. Reversing an APK file can be interesting to understand how an app works, how it manages the permissions and my data, if there are vulnerabilities. I was looking for a different Android mail client, so I started to reverse them and I found many mail clients on Play Store were - maybe are - vulnerable to Javascript injection. I found eight important apps vulnerable to cross-site scripting: **Newton Mail** 10.0.23, **Nine Email** 4.5.3a, **Blue Mail** 1.9.5.36, **Edison Email** 1.7.1, **Email TypeApp** 1.9.5.35 and **Spark** 2.0.2 + **two** apps I can’t disclose now. In April and May 2019 I wrote to vendors of these apps, but only someone replied to me.

### Javascript Injection in Android Webview[#](#javascript-injection-in-android-webview)

Javascript injection in Android WebView is a serious vulnerability because in some scenario it was possible to execute code remotely by injecting a malicious Javascript code in the WebView (**CVE-2012-6636**, **CVE-2013-4710**). These vulnerabilities were fixed by Google, but Javascript injection in the WebView is yet a common bug, also for this reason Google have created [a support page](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9095419?hl=en-GB) to explain how to use Javascript interfaces in the WebView. Although Javascript injection usually doesn’t lead to code execution, it is still a serious vulnerability [because can be used to steal data](https://labs.integrity.pt/articles/review-android-webviews-fileaccess-attack-vectors/index.html) (similar to CVE-2019-11730 PoC) if `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` is set `True`.

#### Newton Mail[#](#newton-mail)

**App:** Newton Mail
**Version:** 10.0.23
**Downloads:** +1.000.000
**Has vendor replied? Yes**
**CVE:** 2019-12365

#### Edison Mail[#](#edison-mail)

**App:** Edison Mail

**Downloads:** +1.000.000
**Has vendor replied? Yes**
**CVE:** 2019-12368

#### Nine - Email & Calendar[#](#nine---email--calendar)

**App:** Nine - Email & Calendar
**Version:** 4.5.3a
**Downloads:** +1.000.000
**Has vendor replied? No**
**CVE:** 2019-12366

#### Spark[#](#spark)

**App:** Spark
**Version:** 2.0.2
**Downloads:** +500.000

**App:** Blue Mail
**Version:** 1.9.5.36

**CVE:** 2019-12369

The set aside function, the home screen and the division between personal and automated email will be the most helpful. I like gatekeeper - especially that you can look into it before deciding.
