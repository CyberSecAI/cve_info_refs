{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `rrd_fetch_json.php` file. Specifically, the `timePeriod` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). By injecting malicious JavaScript code into this parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
	  "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage the XSS vulnerability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript within the victim's browser. This allows for a series of attacks, ultimately leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) with root privileges on the affected pfSense server. By stealing the CSRF token and subsequently making a request to `diag_command.php`, the attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Phishing website/page",
	  "HTTP POST Request"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated pfSense administrator into visiting a crafted phishing page and submitting a form with the malicious `timePeriod` parameter. The attacker also needs to host the malicious `payload.js` and `shell.txt` files on their own server.",
    "additional_info": "The provided content details how an XSS vulnerability in `rrd_fetch_json.php` can be exploited to perform a CSRF attack against `diag_command.php`, ultimately leading to arbitrary PHP code execution on the pfSense server. The attacker uses Javascript to extract the CSRF token from the page, and then uses it in a second request to execute a curl command. This vulnerability is specific to pfSense versions 2.4.4-p2 and 2.4.4-p3, as noted in the provided description."
