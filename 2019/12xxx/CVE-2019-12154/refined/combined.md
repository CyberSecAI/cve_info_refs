# PDFreactor 10 Maintenance Release 10.1.10722 now available – Important Security Update

May 27, 2019by RealObjects GmbH

A maintenance release for PDFreactor 10 is now available. This release addresses security vulnerabilities that affect all PDFreactor versions prior to this one.

### What are the vulnerabilities?

PDFreactor releases prior to 10.1.10722 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF; CVE-2019-12153: by Sean Melia of Aon’s Cyber Solutions) and to attacks using XML external entity processing (XXE; CVE-2019-12154: by Sean Melia of Aon’s Cyber Solutions).

### How can these vulnerabilities be exploited?

PDFreactor works under the assumption that all content and data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.) it processes comes from trusted sources. However, this may not always be the case depending on your integration. If attackers are able to inject custom HTML, CSS or JavaScript into the content which is processed by PDFreactor, they may be able to gain access to files on the PDFreactor server or private network resources.

XXE can be exploited by specifying external entities in XML files in such a way that they load private files or network resources which is essentially an SSRF attack. In addition, malicious XML can be used for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack via the so called “billion laughs attack”.

### How are these vulnerabilities addressed by this release?

PDFreactor now features security settings which can prevent these exploits:

By default PDFreactor no longer loads resources from the server’s file system. There are certain exceptions to this general security rule, so please refer to the chapter “[Security](https://www.pdfreactor.com/support/)” in the PDFreactor manual for a more detailed explanation. This protects against SSRF.

When converting XML documents, PDFreactor will no longer automatically load external XML parser resources, such as DTDs, entities or XIncludes. This protects against DoS attacks using XXE.

**Important! Before updating, please refer to the [migration guide](/product/doc/migration-guide.html) for more information as these changes might impact the functionality of existing integrations.**

Please note that depending on the integration and usage scenario, the security settings of PDFreactor need to be configured appropriately. Please refer to the chapter “[Security](https://www.pdfreactor.com/support/)” in the PDFreactor manual. Also, depending on the integration and usage scenario it might be advisable to configure appropriate outbound firewall rules on the server that runs PDFreactor, to prevent access to internal network resources.

This release also includes the following changes:

* JREs packaged with installers or containers have been updated to OpenJDK 12.0.1. (#7686)
* Footnotes are no longer horizontally misaligned in rare cases. (#7588)
* Images with a max-width value no longer lead to content overflowing paragraph. (#7595)
* Documents containing large amounts of SVGs no longer cause non-terminating conversions in rare cases. (#7685)
* JavaScript inserting ‘div’ elements into ‘span’ elements no longer causes exceptions in specific cases. (#7702)
* Certain cases of single-line row flex containers no longer cause non-terminating layouts. (#7699)
* JavaScript processing is no longer aborted when BoxDescription arrays are accessed with invalid indices. (#7692)

* JavaScript processing is no longer aborted when BoxDescription arrays are accessed with invalid indices. (#7692)

For a full list of changes and corrections see the [changelog](/product/changelog.htm).

Important release notes und upgrading information can be found in the [readme](/product/readme.htm).

The PDFreactor 10 installation packages are available for download in the [download area](/download/).

# SSRF And XXE Vulnerabilities In PDFreactor

[Home](https://www.aon.com/cyber-solutions/) → [Aon’s Cyber Labs](https://www.aon.com/cyber-solutions/aon_cyber_labs/) → SSRF And XXE Vulnerabilities In PDFreactor
###### Tuesday, May 28, 2019 At 2:51PM

Aon’s Cyber Solutions recently discovered two vulnerabilities in RealObjects PDFreactior prior to version 10.1.10722 in the default configuration.  The identified vulnerabilities allow attackers to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attacks in cases where PDFreactor is used to process user-controllable HTML over a network. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows for an attacker to access local system files as well as internal network resources in order to retrieve secrets or bypass firewall rules.  These vulnerabilities were discovered by Sean Melia.

Aon’s Cyber Solutions would like to thank RealObjects for working with us as part of our coordinated disclosure process to quickly remediate these vulnerabilities.

**Timeline:**

04/08/19 – Initial disclosure

04/09/19 – Receipt acknowledged

04/18/19 – Issues confirmed, documentation updates & fixes slated for 10.1

04/18/19 – SSRF issue discovered by a 3rd party and published as a 0 day on Twitter

04/24/19 – RealObjects publishes preliminary advisory with suggested workarounds

05/27/19 – Version 10.1.10722 released

**Vendor Advisories:**

<https://www.pdfreactor.com/pdfreactor-10-maintenance-release-10-1-10722-now-available/>

<https://www.pdfreactor.com/important-pdfreactor-security-advisory/>

## CVE-2019-12153 Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

**Overview:**

The PDFreactor library prior to version 10.1.10722 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, where user input defining a URL (e.g. protocol and hostname information) is accepted and used to build a request to an arbitrary host. An example of exploitation would be to access internal network resources such as “http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/” and retrieve the AWS secret keys. Additionally, local system files can be extracted this way using the “file:/” or “netdoc://” handlers.

**Remediation:**

PDFreactor version 10.1.10722 will no longer load resources from the local filesystem by default.  Documentation and sample code have been updated to clarify the risks of allowing external references and demonstrate how they may be safely allowed.

## CVE-2019-12154 XML external entity (XXE)

**Overview:**

The PDFreactor library prior to version 10.1.10722 is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. User input defining an external resource, such as an XML document or SVG image, that contains a malicious payload is parsed by the backend Java XML Parser. When the malicious XML payload is parsed, local system files or internal hosts can be interacted with via common handlers such as “file:/”, “netdoc://”, or “http://”. This exposure is due to the way in which the parser handles XML documents containing external entities. When an XML parser encounters a DOCTYPE declaring an external entity, it expands all instances of the entity with the contents of the URI reference defined.

**Remediation:**

PDFreactor version 10.1.10722 disables External XML Entity processing by default.  If a user wishes to enable it, the URLStreamHandler class has been updated to process External XML Entity resolution to allow for custom validation to be performed.
