The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12154.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the PDFreactor library, prior to version 10.1.10722, parses XML documents. Specifically, it is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. The parser automatically loads external XML parser resources, such as DTDs, entities, or XIncludes, which can be exploited by malicious actors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) processing vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can access local system files
- An attacker can access internal network resources.
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through the "billion laughs attack".
- Potential for SSRF by loading files from the system or network resources through the parser

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing crafted XML documents or SVG images with malicious external entities to the PDFreactor library
- By including malicious external entities in XML files loaded by the library

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript into content processed by PDFreactor, or
- Ability to provide or influence the XML input to be processed by the library.
