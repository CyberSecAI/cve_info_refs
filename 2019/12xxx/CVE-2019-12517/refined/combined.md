Sorry for the low rating, I asked earlier about if it is possible to add quiz accordance with category but no reply.
What if I have more than 100 of questions with a different category?
It was promised to update features in the future . But I guess future means a Decade.
Too bad.

SlickQuiz works well and is easy to use: perfect for a quiz plugin.

LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.
