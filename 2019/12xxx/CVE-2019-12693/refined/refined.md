Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12693:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of an incorrect data type for a length variable within the Secure Copy (SCP) feature of Cisco ASA Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Data Type:** A length variable is not of the correct data type, leading to a potential integer overflow or wraparound.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the length variable to roll over (overflow/wraparound), leading to a device crash and a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker initiates the attack remotely over a network using SCP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid privilege level 15 credentials on the affected Cisco ASA device.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the device's management interface from an IP address within the allowed range configured for SSH/SCP access.
- **Initiate SCP Transfer:** The attacker must be able to initiate the transfer of a large file via SCP.

**Additional Notes:**
- The SCP feature is not enabled by default on Cisco ASA Software, meaning the device must be explicitly configured to allow SCP connections to be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is triggered when transferring a large file, which causes the length variable to roll over.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability, and administrators should upgrade to a fixed version of the software.
- The vulnerability only affects Cisco ASA Software. Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software or Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software are not affected.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 6.8 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H, which reflects the network attack vector, low attack complexity, required high privileges, no user interaction, changed scope, no confidentiality or integrity impact and high availability impact.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
