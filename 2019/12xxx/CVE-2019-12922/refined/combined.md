Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-644b438f51
2019-10-01 00:00:33.093480
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : phpMyAdmin
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 4.9.1
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/>
Summary : Handle the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web
Description :
phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of
MySQL over the World Wide Web. Most frequently used operations are supported
by the user interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations, indexes,
users, permissions), while you still have the ability to directly execute any
SQL statement.

Features include an intuitive web interface, support for most MySQL features
(browse and drop databases, tables, views, fields and indexes, create, copy,
drop, rename and alter databases, tables, fields and indexes, maintenance
server, databases and tables, with proposals on server configuration, execute,
edit and bookmark any SQL-statement, even batch-queries, manage MySQL users
and privileges, manage stored procedures and triggers), import data from CSV
and SQL, export data to various formats: CSV, SQL, XML, PDF, OpenDocument Text
and Spreadsheet, Word, Excel, LATEX and others, administering multiple servers,
creating PDF graphics of your database layout, creating complex queries using
Query-by-example (QBE), searching globally in a database or a subset of it,
transforming stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link and much more...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Upstream announcement: Welcome to \*\*phpMyAdmin 4.9.1\*\*, a bugfix release. This
is a regularly-schedule bugfix release that also includes some security
hardening measures. We wish to point out that this also includes a routine fix
for an issue that has been reported as CVE-2019-12922. The fix for this has been
in our release queue to be part of this release, however it is the opinion of
the team that the reported attack vector did not justify a separate release.
This release includes fixes for many bugs, including: \* Editing columns with
CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP for MySQL versions 8.0.13 and newer \* Compatibility issues
with PHP 8 \* Export of GIS visualization \* Enhanced descriptions for
several collation types \* Creating a user with a single quote in the password
string \* Unexpected quotes during import and export on text fields \*
Improvements to adding new tables to Designer \* Fix an issue where an
authenticated user could trigger heavy traffic between the database server and
web server \* Fix a weakness where an attacker, under certain conditions,
working at the same time as an administrator is using the setup script, could
delete a server from the setup script There are many, many more bug fixes
thanks to the efforts of our developers, Google Summer of Code applicants, and
other contributors. The phpMyAdmin team

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-6404181bf9
2019-10-02 01:58:55.546783
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : phpMyAdmin
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.9.1
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/>
Summary : Handle the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web
Description :
phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of
MySQL over the World Wide Web. Most frequently used operations are supported
by the user interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations, indexes,
users, permissions), while you still have the ability to directly execute any
SQL statement.

Features include an intuitive web interface, support for most MySQL features
(browse and drop databases, tables, views, fields and indexes, create, copy,
drop, rename and alter databases, tables, fields and indexes, maintenance
server, databases and tables, with proposals on server configuration, execute,
edit and bookmark any SQL-statement, even batch-queries, manage MySQL users
and privileges, manage stored procedures and triggers), import data from CSV
and SQL, export data to various formats: CSV, SQL, XML, PDF, OpenDocument Text
and Spreadsheet, Word, Excel, LATEX and others, administering multiple servers,
creating PDF graphics of your database layout, creating complex queries using
Query-by-example (QBE), searching globally in a database or a subset of it,
transforming stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link and much more...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Upstream announcement: Welcome to \*\*phpMyAdmin 4.9.1\*\*, a bugfix release. This
is a regularly-schedule bugfix release that also includes some security
hardening measures. We wish to point out that this also includes a routine fix
for an issue that has been reported as CVE-2019-12922. The fix for this has been
in our release queue to be part of this release, however it is the opinion of
the team that the reported attack vector did not justify a separate release.
This release includes fixes for many bugs, including: \* Editing columns with
CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP for MySQL versions 8.0.13 and newer \* Compatibility issues
with PHP 8 \* Export of GIS visualization \* Enhanced descriptions for
several collation types \* Creating a user with a single quote in the password
string \* Unexpected quotes during import and export on text fields \*
Improvements to adding new tables to Designer \* Fix an issue where an
authenticated user could trigger heavy traffic between the database server and
web server \* Fix a weakness where an attacker, under certain conditions,
working at the same time as an administrator is using the setup script, could
delete a server from the setup script There are many, many more bug fixes
thanks to the efforts of our developers, Google Summer of Code applicants, and
other contributors. The phpMyAdmin team

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-3b5a7abe17
2019-10-02 01:40:18.127834
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : phpMyAdmin
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 4.9.1
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/>
Summary : Handle the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web
Description :
phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of
MySQL over the World Wide Web. Most frequently used operations are supported
by the user interface (managing databases, tables, fields, relations, indexes,
users, permissions), while you still have the ability to directly execute any
SQL statement.

Features include an intuitive web interface, support for most MySQL features
(browse and drop databases, tables, views, fields and indexes, create, copy,
drop, rename and alter databases, tables, fields and indexes, maintenance
server, databases and tables, with proposals on server configuration, execute,
edit and bookmark any SQL-statement, even batch-queries, manage MySQL users
and privileges, manage stored procedures and triggers), import data from CSV
and SQL, export data to various formats: CSV, SQL, XML, PDF, OpenDocument Text
and Spreadsheet, Word, Excel, LATEX and others, administering multiple servers,
creating PDF graphics of your database layout, creating complex queries using
Query-by-example (QBE), searching globally in a database or a subset of it,
transforming stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link and much more...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Upstream announcement: Welcome to \*\*phpMyAdmin 4.9.1\*\*, a bugfix release. This
is a regularly-schedule bugfix release that also includes some security
hardening measures. We wish to point out that this also includes a routine fix
for an issue that has been reported as CVE-2019-12922. The fix for this has been
in our release queue to be part of this release, however it is the opinion of
the team that the reported attack vector did not justify a separate release.
This release includes fixes for many bugs, including: \* Editing columns with
CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP for MySQL versions 8.0.13 and newer \* Compatibility issues
with PHP 8 \* Export of GIS visualization \* Enhanced descriptions for
several collation types \* Creating a user with a single quote in the password
string \* Unexpected quotes during import and export on text fields \*
Improvements to adding new tables to Designer \* Fix an issue where an
authenticated user could trigger heavy traffic between the database server and
web server \* Fix a weakness where an attacker, under certain conditions,
working at the same time as an administrator is using the setup script, could
delete a server from the setup script There are many, many more bug fixes
thanks to the efforts of our developers, Google Summer of Code applicants, and
other contributors. The phpMyAdmin team
