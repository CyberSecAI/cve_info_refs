Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-12098:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly verify the PA-PKINIT-KX key exchange when anonymous PKINIT (Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos) is used by a client. Specifically, the client-side implementation in `krb5_init_creds_step` within `lib/krb5/init_creds_pw.c` was missing this crucial verification. This is in violation of RFC8062 section 7.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Key Exchange Verification:** The core weakness is that the client does not confirm the PA-PKINIT-KX key exchange during anonymous PKINIT authentication, a step which should verify that the ticket session key is the combined key of the KDC contribution key and the reply key.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**  An active attacker could exploit this flaw to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. By intercepting and manipulating the key exchange, an attacker could potentially impersonate the client to obtain unauthorized access.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based, allowing an attacker to intercept and modify Kerberos traffic between a client and the Key Distribution Center (KDC).
*   **Active Attack:** This is not a passive attack; it requires the attacker to actively intercept and modify network traffic during the authentication process.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker must be positioned on the network such that they can intercept traffic between a client attempting anonymous PKINIT authentication and the KDC.
*   **Active Manipulation:** The attacker needs the capability to actively manipulate the Kerberos packets during the key exchange phase.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is client-side only.
*   This issue was introduced in Heimdal 1.4.0 and fixed in Heimdal 7.6.0.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 7.4, indicating a high severity.
*   The attack complexity is high because it is dependent on the interception and active manipulation of data.
*   There is no user interaction requirement.

**Summary of Fix:**

*   The fix for this issue involves implementing the required verification of the PA-PKINIT-KX key exchange on the client-side during anonymous PKINIT, per RFC8062 Section 7. This prevents MitM attacks that exploit the lack of verification.
