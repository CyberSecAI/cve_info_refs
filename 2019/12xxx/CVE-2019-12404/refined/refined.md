Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the `InfoContent.jsp` file of Apache JSPWiki. This vulnerability is triggered by a carefully crafted plugin link invocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in `InfoContent.jsp`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via a plugin link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit enables the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially access sensitive information about the victim, such as cookies, session tokens, or other data that might be available within the browser context.
- **Other Malicious Actions:** An attacker may be able to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying page content, stealing login credentials, or redirecting to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Plugin Link Invocation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious plugin link that, when processed by `InfoContent.jsp`, introduces XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Malicious Plugin Links:** The attacker must be capable of creating a plugin link containing the malicious payload.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a victim to access the vulnerable JSP page ( `InfoContent.jsp` ) while the injected Javascript in the malicious plugin link is being processed.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** Apache JSPWiki versions up to 2.11.0.M4 are affected by this vulnerability.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is addressed in Apache JSPWiki version 2.11.0.M5 and later. Users are advised to upgrade to the latest version to avoid exploitation.
- **Discovery:** This vulnerability was discovered by ADLab of VenusTech.
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring proper HTML escaping when `jspwiki.translatorReader.allowHTML` is disabled.
- The markdown module was also fixed to respect the `jspwiki.translatorReader.allowHTML` property, preventing XSS in markdown syntax.

The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description by outlining the affected component (`InfoContent.jsp`), the method of attack (plugin link invocation), and the specific area where XSS was present, with fixes in specific translator modules.
