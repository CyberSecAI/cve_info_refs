# Command Injection (Privilege Escalation) #231

## Description

![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Jun 20, 2019](https://github.com/icon-project/loopchain/issues/231#issue-458407377)
## Description:

Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.

## Details:

An attacker can manipulate DEFAULT\_SCORE\_HOST which is trusted user supplied input, this can be used to inject commands and gain arbitrary code execution.

## Affected URL:

<https://github.com/icon-project/loopchain/blob/2ab4734138d6a2a480a08ee023b2f4d74679ed43/loopchain/__main__.py>

## Affected Code:

`if os.getenv('DEFAULT_SCORE_HOST') is not None: os.system("ssh-keyscan "+os.getenv('DEFAULT_SCORE_HOST')+" >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts")`

## Reference:

<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection>

## Example/PoC:

```
import os
os.environ['DEFAULT_SCORE_HOST'] = ';ip addr;'
os.system("ssh-keyscan "+os.getenv('DEFAULT_SCORE_HOST')+" >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts")
usage: ssh-keyscan [-46cHv] [-f file] [-p port] [-T timeout] [-t type]
