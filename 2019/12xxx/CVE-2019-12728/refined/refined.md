{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The project's build files are configured to resolve dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere",
      "CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check"
    ],
    "impact": "Compromised dependencies could lead to maliciously infected build artifacts and potentially infect developers using these artifacts. This could result in arbitrary code execution and other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker capable of performing MITM attacks on the network during the dependency resolution process."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of 8.1/10. The issue was raised in the Grails project and includes links to POC code demonstrating how JAR files can be maliciously compromised inflight via MITM attacks. The vulnerability can be mitigated by ensuring all dependencies are resolved over HTTPS. It is suggested that the project either file for a CVE or validate previous releases by building them with the HTTPS fix applied and comparing the artifact hashes with published versions.",
