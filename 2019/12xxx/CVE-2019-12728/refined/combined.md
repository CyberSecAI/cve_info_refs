## Description

![@JLLeitschuh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1323708?u=477b44e744c9d63ec1386f1c728195936b42cbe7&v=4&size=48)[JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh)opened [on Feb 19, 2019](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/11250#issue-412141731)

[CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)

[CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html)

The build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Any of these artifacts could have been MITM to maliciously compromise them and infect the build artifacts that were produced. Additionally, if any of these JARs or other dependencies were compromised, any developers using these could continue to be infected past updating to fix this.

This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of 8.1/10

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H>

### This isn't just theoretical

POC code has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file inflight.

See:

* <https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/>
* <https://github.com/mveytsman/dilettante>

### MITM Attacks Increasingly Common

### Public Disclosure

#### Option 1: File for a CVE

A project maintainer for this project should probably file for a CVE number to inform the public about this vulnerability in the build for this project. The goal is to inform the public that there was a potential for published build artifacts to have been maliciously compromised in earlier releases.

If a maintainer on this project works for or is associated with a CNA, please have them file it with them:

[cve.mitre.org/cve/request\_id.html](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html)

Otherwise, an open source CVE should be filed for here:

[iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)

#### Option 2: Manually validate the release artifacts

If this project's build is [fully reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds). An alternative to filing for a CVE is to go back and build the earlier releases (with the HTTPS patch applied) to confirm the artifacts were not tampered when they were built. This can be done by comparing the hashes of the artifacts built locally with the ones published. If the hashes of all previous artifacts match those that are published, you can safely assume that the releases were not tampered with.

Again, this assumes that the build if fully reproducible and will require significantly more work.

## [From Accidental to Intentional: Your Roadmap to Architectural Excellence](https://objectcomputing.com/how-we-share/news1/2024/08/08/accidental-intentional-your-roadmap-architectural-excellence)

August 08, 2024

The first article of this two-part series discussed how to identify Accidental Architecture and the challenges it can cause an organization. We defined Intentional Architecture as a deliberate system architecture that is created from a set of goals, trade-offs, team structure, and constraints under which it’s built and maintained.

## [Maximizing Performance with Netty and Reactive Programming in Java](https://objectcomputing.com/how-we-share/news1/2024/06/27/maximizing-performance-netty-and-reactive-programming-java)

June 27, 2024

In the modern world of software development, building responsive and scalable applications is essential. This is especially true for cloud-based deployments, where keeping costs down while maintaining performance is crucial. Reactive programming, a paradigm centered on efficiently processing asynchronous events and data streams, can be an excellent choice for achieving this.

February 06, 2024

By Garey Hoffman

As a technology leader immersed in IT consulting, I find myself reflecting on Gartner’s latest 2024 Forecasts of IT Spending. The projections indicate a noteworthy growth of 6.8% this year, a significant uptick from the 3.3% observed in 2023.

This part of the announcement gave me pause...
