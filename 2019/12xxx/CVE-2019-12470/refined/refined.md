Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12470:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content confirms that CVE-2019-12470 is related to the exposure of suppressed logs in the RevisionDelete page in MediaWiki.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks when viewing suppressed logs through the RevisionDelete page. The `LogEventsList::userCan()` function wasn't correctly verifying if a user had the necessary rights to view the log type, specifically the suppress log.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The system did not properly enforce access controls for viewing suppressed logs.
- **Direct Object Reference:** By manually setting the `logid` to a suppress log entry, users could bypass the intended access restrictions.
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could gain access to suppressed log information, which should only be available to administrators or users with specific permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information contained in suppressed logs could be exposed to unauthorized users.
- **Privacy Violation:** Users whose actions were suppressed in logs could have their activities revealed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker could modify the URL parameters to specifically target a suppressed log entry, such as by crafting a URL with a modified `logid`.
- **Special:EditTags:** Using the "Edit tags of selected log entries" button and setting a logid to a suppress log.
- **Special:Log:** Navigate to the log, check an entry, and use "Edit tags of selected log entries"

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** An attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the MediaWiki instance.
- **Basic knowledge of MediaWiki:** They would need to understand how to interact with the MediaWiki log system and manipulate URL parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding permission checks to the `LogEventsList::userCan()` function.
- Patches were deployed to multiple MediaWiki versions, including 1.27.6, 1.30.2, 1.31.2, 1.32.2, and 1.33.2.
- This issue is related to another vulnerability, CVE-2019-12469 (T222036), which exposed suppressed user names or logs in Special:EditTags.
