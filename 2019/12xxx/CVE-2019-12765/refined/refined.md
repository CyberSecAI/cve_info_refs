  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CSV export functionality of the com_actionlogs component in Joomla! is vulnerable to CSV injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSV Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can inject malicious code into exported CSV files. When opened with spreadsheet software, this code could be executed, potentially compromising the user's system or data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating data that is included in the action logs, attackers can inject malicious CSV formulas or scripts into the exported CSV file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers need to be able to create or modify data that is logged by the Joomla action logs. This may require having sufficient access to interact with the Joomla instance in a way that results in log entries."
