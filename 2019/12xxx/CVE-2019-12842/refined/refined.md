The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains, and it **does** contain information about CVE-2019-12842.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, which means the application is echoing user-provided input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the context of the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user input before reflecting it back to the user's browser. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Execution of malicious scripts:** A successful XSS attack can lead to a range of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking: Attacker can steal session cookies to impersonate the victim user.
    *   Data theft: Sensitive information displayed within the vulnerable web page can be accessed.
    *   Malware distribution: Redirecting users to malicious sites to install malware
    *   Defacement: Altering the appearance of the webpage.
    *   Phishing: Presenting a fake login form to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:**  The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload. When a victim clicks on this malicious link, the server echoes back the attacker's payload without proper sanitization, leading to its execution in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL that includes the malicious XSS payload.
*   **Victim interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking on the malicious URL. This might involve sending the link via phishing email, social media, or any other way that will convince a victim to click it.

**Specific details from the content:**

*   **Affected product:** TeamCity
*   **Severity:** Moderate
*   **Fixed Version:** 2018.2.2
