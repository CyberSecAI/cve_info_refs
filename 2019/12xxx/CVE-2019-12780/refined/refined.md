{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Command injection in the Belkin Wemo UPnP API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command Injection: The SmartDevURL argument within the SetSmartDevInfo action is vulnerable to command injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input to this parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the affected Belkin Wemo devices.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted SOAP request to the UPnP control endpoint, specifically targeting the SetSmartDevInfo action and injecting malicious commands within the SmartDevURL parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, which is typically on the same local network."
