CVE-2019-12938: Poste.io logs leak

Root cause of vulnerability:
The roundcube logs are stored in the /logs/ directory, which is protected by a .htaccess file. However, on nginx (the default web server for poste.io), the .htaccess file is ignored, making the log files inside the /logs directory accessible to anyone.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure file access control due to misconfiguration of the web server (nginx) ignoring .htaccess rules.
- Exposure of sensitive information (user email and IP addresses) in the logs.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can access the Roundcube logs and obtain sensitive information, such as user email addresses and IP addresses. In environments with extended logging enabled, other error log files might also be leaked.

Attack vectors:
By accessing the /webmail/logs/sendmail URL, an attacker can view the Roundcube logs.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to access the poste.io web server. No authentication is required to access the logs.
