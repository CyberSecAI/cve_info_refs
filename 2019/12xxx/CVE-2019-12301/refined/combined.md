# Percona Server for MySQL 5.6.44-85.0

May 17, 2019

[Hrvoje Matijakovic](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/hrvojem)

**NOTE [2019-05-18]**: Debian/Ubuntu `5.6.44-85.0-1` packages were replaced today in the repositories with the `5.6.44-85.0-2` because they would reset the root password to an empty string during the upgrade on Debian/Ubuntu (bug [#5640](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5640)). If you upgraded packages on Debian/Ubuntu to the `5.6.44-85.0-1` please upgrade to `5.6.44-85.0-2` and re-set your root password.

[![Percona Server for MySQL 5.6.44-85.0](data:image/svg+xml...)](https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Percona_ServerLogoVert_CMYK.png) Percona announces the release of [Percona Server](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-server) for MySQL 5.6.44-85.0 on May 17, 2019. Download the latest version from the [Percona web site](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.6/Percona-Server-5.6.44-84.0/ "Percona Server 5.6") or the Percona [Software Repositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/installation.html#using-percona-software-repositories). You can also run Docker containers from the images in the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/percona-server/).

Based on MySQL [5.6.44](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.6/en/news-5-6-44.html), and including all the bug fixes in it, Percona Server for MySQL 5.6.44-85.0 is the current GA release in the Percona Server for MySQL 5.6 series. Percona Server for MySQL is open-source and free – this is the latest release of our enhanced, drop-in replacement for MySQL.

**New Features:**

* New [`Audit_log_buffer_size_overflow`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/audit_log_plugin.html#Audit_log_buffer_size_overflow) status variable has been implemented to track when an Audit Log Plugin entry was either dropped or written directly to the file due to its size being bigger than [`audit_log_buffer_size`](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/audit_log_plugin.html#audit_log_buffer_size) variable.

**Bugs Fixed:**

* *TokuDB* storage engine would assert on load when used with jemalloc 5.x. Bug fixed [#5406](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5406).
* `FLUSH` commands written to the binary log could cause errors in case of replication. Bug fixed [#1827](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-1827) (upstream [#88720](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=88720)).
* *TokuDB* storage engine couldn’t be enabled on Docker images. Bug fixed [#5283](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5283).
* the `ACCESS_DENIED` field of the `information_schema.user_statistics` table was not updated correctly. Bugs fixed [#3956](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-3956), [#4996](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-4996).
* `postinst` maintainer script in `percona-server-server-5.6` package did not escape the password properly and as a result would fail to use it. Bug fixed [#4572](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-4572).
* the page cleaner could sleep for long time when the system clock was adjusted to an earlier point in time. Bug fixed [#5221](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5221) (upstream [#93708](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=93708)).
* executing `SHOW BINLOG EVENT` from an invalid position could result in a [segmentation fault](https://www.percona.com/blog/segmentation-fault-a-dba-perspective/) on 32bit machines. Bug fixed [#5243](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5243).
* `BLOB` entries in the binary log could become corrupted in case when a database with *Blackhole* tables served as an intermediate binary log server in a replication chain. Bug fixed [#5353](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5353) (upstream [#93917](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=93917)).
* when [Audit Log Plugin](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/management/audit_log_plugin.html#audit-log-plugin) was enabled, the server could use a lot of memory when handling large queries. Bug fixed [#5395](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5395).
* PerconaFT `locktree` library was re-licensed to Apache v2 license. Bug fixed [#5501](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5501).

Other bugs fixed: [#5512](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5512), [#5550](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5550), [#5578](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5578), [#5388](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5388) (upstream [#94121](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=94121)), and [#5441](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5441).

This release also contains the fixes for the following security issues: CVE-2018-3123, CVE-2019-2683, CVE-2019-2627, and CVE-2019-2614.

Release notes for *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6.44-85.0 are available in the [online documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.6/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.6.44-85.0.html). Please report any bugs on the [JIRA bug tracker](https://jira.percona.com/projects/PS).
