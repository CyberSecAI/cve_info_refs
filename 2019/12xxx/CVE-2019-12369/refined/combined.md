## Our Happy Customers

TypeApp is the tall glass of ice water ? I desperately needed and although I'm not usually a letter writer (except to report something else not working right) I just had to say THANK YOU for being the calm in the storm of my little world. You should at least charge 99¢ for the app... Heck, I'd be willing to pay $19.99 a year for it!

Thanks for what you have bestowed on mankind.

T.L. Morris

Don't leave many reviews, but I have to say this is a really high quality app, and better still the customer support I have received is the best of any company I have dealt with. Three times I have contacted them and on each occasion I have received helpful, friendly advice WITHIN AN HOUR! Ten stars for TypeApp

Great App. INCREDIBLE support

Nigel Foster

All email clients should take notice, even the ones created by the phone manufacturers, yes Apple & Samsung I'm talking about you also. The feature set and ease of use is remarkable for a company that doesn't generate revenues from ads in their app but only thru donations and word of mouth. It's intuitive and makes setting up emails quick and easy. Marking emails for later is also a great feature.. Try it out and once you get used to the layout, emailing becomes second nature...

Simply the best email client available.

Ty Wu

Your search has ended. Simply the best, and I tried them all. One of the very few apps that keeps getting better with every update. Black screen theme to save on your eyes & your battery. Works flawlessly. See all your emails accounts on one Unified email page. New update added the ability to create folders and rename them. Sent a message to customer service and got an immediate reply. Wish I could delete my pre-installed Android/Google Gmail app. Maybe Google should buy this app for "10 million dollars"

This is the best!

Thomas J Gallina

I have tested at least 20 different mailing apps and this one is by far the best one so far. Awesome style and feel. Does every single one of my requirements.. super job guys. Very well done.. market leaders!!!

Best email app by far

Lynton Jennings

I love all the features in this app, and the UI is very slick, the best part is this app is backed by a great team who will read, comment, or reply to you questions and requisites.

Great app, Great team

Johnny Vestergaard

One program that can bring all my private and business E-mail accounts into one program. You Guy’s should really charge some major bucks for this besides it was so simple to set up. GREAT JOB!!

Fabulously great app

Siviaiz

TypeApp is the one Android email app I could find that worked with all my accounts and has a unified inbox. The UI is clean and easy to navigate, tons of options for customization. Awesome.

All around great

Lana Burch

Good looking interface and straightforward app, everything that I need in terms of feature and capabilities, great support from the developers. What else can you ask for?

Very Nice

Susan Pavilkey

Coming from many years using the iOS mail app, I was pleasantly suprised when discovering that there was a mail client for a life device that was almost as capable as a desktop app!

Well designed and feature rich

Glenn Foster

I think this is one of the best app on Android. I loved this app, because I don’t need to install any other mail app to fetching all of my mail accounts. Thanks developers, two thumbs up for you all. Great Job!!!

Very Loved This One

Arijeet Chakravarty

Just love this email all, have five different accounts setup all work great. Best email all out there and by far. Recommended wholeheartedly.

Best Email

Judy Chancey

I have used quite a few email apps and so far this is by far the best. It is very organized and is used without a hitch (though that is true of most of them at first). I am happy with it.

Excellent

Sarah McCarty Gooding

# Javascript Injection in six Android mail clients

February 15, 2020 · 2 min · 340 words · Luigi Gubello

During last spring (2019) I started to “open and read” the Android applications before installing them. Reversing an APK file can be interesting to understand how an app works, how it manages the permissions and my data, if there are vulnerabilities. I was looking for a different Android mail client, so I started to reverse them and I found many mail clients on Play Store were - maybe are - vulnerable to Javascript injection. I found eight important apps vulnerable to cross-site scripting: **Newton Mail** 10.0.23, **Nine Email** 4.5.3a, **Blue Mail** 1.9.5.36, **Edison Email** 1.7.1, **Email TypeApp** 1.9.5.35 and **Spark** 2.0.2 + **two** apps I can’t disclose now. In April and May 2019 I wrote to vendors of these apps, but only someone replied to me.

### Javascript Injection in Android Webview[#](#javascript-injection-in-android-webview)

Javascript injection in Android WebView is a serious vulnerability because in some scenario it was possible to execute code remotely by injecting a malicious Javascript code in the WebView (**CVE-2012-6636**, **CVE-2013-4710**). These vulnerabilities were fixed by Google, but Javascript injection in the WebView is yet a common bug, also for this reason Google have created [a support page](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9095419?hl=en-GB) to explain how to use Javascript interfaces in the WebView. Although Javascript injection usually doesn’t lead to code execution, it is still a serious vulnerability [because can be used to steal data](https://labs.integrity.pt/articles/review-android-webviews-fileaccess-attack-vectors/index.html) (similar to CVE-2019-11730 PoC) if `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` is set `True`.

#### Newton Mail[#](#newton-mail)

**App:** Newton Mail
**Version:** 10.0.23
**Downloads:** +1.000.000
**Has vendor replied? Yes**
**CVE:** 2019-12365

In Netwon Mail 10.0.23 `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` is set `True`.

#### Edison Mail[#](#edison-mail)

**App:** Edison Mail
**Version:** 1.7.1
**Downloads:** +1.000.000
**Has vendor replied? Yes**
**CVE:** 2019-12368

In Edison Mail 1.7.1 `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` is set `True`.

#### Nine - Email & Calendar[#](#nine---email--calendar)

**App:** Nine - Email & Calendar
**Version:** 4.5.3a
**Downloads:** +1.000.000
**Has vendor replied? No**
**CVE:** 2019-12366

#### Spark[#](#spark)

**App:** Spark
**Version:** 2.0.2
**Downloads:** +500.000
**Has vendor replied? Yes**
**CVE:** 2019-12370

#### Blue Mail[#](#blue-mail)

**App:** Blue Mail
**Version:** 1.9.5.36
**Downloads:** +5.000.000
**Has vendor replied? No**
**CVE:** 2019-12367

#### TypeApp Email[#](#typeapp-email)

**App:** TypeApp Email
**Version:** 1.9.5.35
**Downloads:** +1.000.000
**Has vendor replied? No**
**CVE:** 2019-12369
