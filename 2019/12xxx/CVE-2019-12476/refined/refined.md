The provided content contains information related to CVE-2019-12476.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an authentication bypass in the ADSelfService Plus application. This is triggered by attempting to reset a password when disconnected from the enterprise network and connected to a different network.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass
- Insecure handling of network connectivity changes

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to gain a system shell without any authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Disconnecting from the enterprise network and connecting to a different network (e.g., a personal hotspot).
- Initiating the password reset process from the thick client application.
- Utilizing the "search for this site" functionality within the application which opens a new Internet Explorer window.
- Opening a file explorer window within Internet Explorer and browsing to `c:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- User must have the ADSelfService Plus application installed.
- User needs to be able to disconnect from the enterprise network and connect to an external network.
- User needs to have physical access to a machine with the affected software.

**Additional notes:**
- The exploit was also verified in other vendors.
- A patch (5.0.6) exists but a bypass was found. The bypass was unstable and would be released once a stable way of automating it was found.
- The exploit affects all versions of Windows.
- The repository `0katz/CVE-2019-12476` on Github contains a PoC for the exploit.
