Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12109:

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-12109 is a vulnerability in MiniUPnPd where the software incorrectly handles unpopulated user XML input. This can lead to a crash of the MiniUPnPd service, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied XML data when it's missing expected values. Specifically, the `GetOutboundPinholeTimeout` function is affected by this issue.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation and error handling in MiniUPnPd's XML parsing logic. This lack of validation allows the program to proceed with missing or invalid data, leading to a crash. Specifically, the commit 13585f1, introduces a check that was meant to validate that certain required arguments (`int_port`, `ext_port`, and `protocol`) were provided to the `GetOutboundPinholeTimeout` function, but the check was flawed: it was checking `ext_port` instead of `rem_port` . The following commit, 86030db, fixes the check by replacing `ext_port` with `rem_port`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. By sending crafted XML input with missing data, an attacker can cause the MiniUPnPd process to crash, rendering the UPnP service unavailable.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is remote, via crafted XML input sent to the MiniUPnPd service. This input can be delivered through the UPnP protocol.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs the ability to send UPnP requests to the vulnerable MiniUPnPd service. They would typically be on the same network or have the ability to send requests through the internet to a publicly exposed MiniUPnPd service.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a patch that was applied to fix the vulnerability (commit 86030db).
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4542-1) explicitly mentions this vulnerability as part of a series of issues fixed in MiniUPnPd.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 1811-1) also lists this CVE as a vulnerability addressed in the update.
