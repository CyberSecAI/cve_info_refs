CVE: N/A
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass
Root cause: The RedwoodHQ application does not require authentication to access the MongoDB database where user data is stored.
Weakness: Missing authentication on the database.
Impact: An attacker can create a new Admin user in RedwoodHQ, granting them full access to the framework's functions.
Attack vector: By connecting to the MongoDB database (default port 27017) without authentication and inserting a new admin user.
Required attacker capabilities: Network access to the MongoDB instance used by RedwoodHQ. The attacker needs to know the host and port of the MongoDB database.
