The provided content contains information about CVE-2019-12245.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Incorrect access control in Silverstripe assets module.
*   **Root Cause:** When using the Upload PHP API to upload files into a protected folder, the file's visibility was incorrectly set to public instead of inheriting the parent folder's permissions.
*   **Affected Versions:** silverstripe/assets ^1.0
*   **Fixed Versions:** 1.3.5, 1.4.4
*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading files to a protected folder using the Upload PHP API. The Silverstripe UserForms module utilizes this functionality.
*   **Impact:** Files uploaded to protected folders were not actually protected and could be accessed publicly if the attacker knew the exact file URL. The complexity of the URL (content hash) mitigated this risk.
*   **Workaround:** Saving the protected folder in admin/assets to re-sync files, or writing a custom task for large amounts of files.
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.9 (Medium)
