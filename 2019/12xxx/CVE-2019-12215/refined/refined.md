Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12215:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the use of `lastError.file` in the `plugins/CorePluginsAdmin/templates/safemode.twig` file, which directly outputs the full path of the Matomo installation on the server when a specific error is triggered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the server's file system path where Matomo is installed. This is due to the application displaying the full file path in an error message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's internal file structure, specifically the full path to the Matomo installation. This information can be used to aid in further attacks by mapping out the application's directory structure, identifying configuration files, and potentially finding other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP request to the Matomo application. The provided payload includes specific parameters such as `date`, `forceView`, `viewDataTable`, `module`, `action`, `widget`, `disableLink`, `idSite`, `period`, and `columns`, and `colors`. This payload is designed to generate a specific error, which leads to the path disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs low privileges to exploit this vulnerability, they can achieve this through a normal authenticated user session to Matomo.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Matomo server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in Matomo version 3.9.1.
*   The vendor disputes the significance of the issue, stating that they do not consider path disclosures as security vulnerabilities.
*   The issue is marked as "DISPUTED" in the GitHub Advisory Database.
