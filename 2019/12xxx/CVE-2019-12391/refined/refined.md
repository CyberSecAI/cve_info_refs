The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Anviz biometric devices and their management software. Specifically regarding CVE-2019-12391, here's the relevant information:

**CVE-2019-12391**

*   **Root Cause:** The Anviz device's communication protocol does not properly log or record certain operations, specifically the "open door" command initiated via the network.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of logging for specific commands.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker can perform actions like opening doors without leaving any trace in the management system logs, making it difficult to detect unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending specific network packets to the device using its proprietary protocol.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Anviz device, or have network access to the device via port forwarding or similar means, and be able to craft and send the specific packets to the device.

**Summary of other vulnerabilities discussed in the article:**

*   **Replay Attack (CVE-2019-12393):** The protocol lacks proper nonce or session management, making it vulnerable to replay attacks. An attacker can resend captured packets to repeat actions like opening doors.
*   **No Password Required (CVE-2019-12392):** The device does not require any password or authentication to respond to requests, meaning anyone on the network can query the device for data or issue commands.
*  **Password Change without Verification (CVE-2019-12394):** The device allows changing the administrator password without requiring the current one.
*   **Data Exposure (CVE-2019-12390/CVE-2019-12389/CVE-2019-12388):** The device stores sensitive information such as cleartext passwords/PINs, RFID tags, names, and other personal parameters, which can be retrieved by anyone on the network without any authentication.
*   **CrossChex Manager Buffer Overflow (CVE-2019-12518):** The CrossChex management software is vulnerable to a buffer overflow via crafted UDP discovery packets. This allows an attacker to gain remote code execution.
*   **CrossChex Update Mechanism Vulnerability (CVE-2020-19594):** The CrossChex software uses an insecure update mechanism via HTTP, allowing an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and deliver malicious software updates to the management software.
