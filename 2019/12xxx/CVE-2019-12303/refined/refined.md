Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of project owners to inject extra fluentd logging configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system does not properly validate or sanitize the fluentd logging configurations provided by project owners.
- **Configuration Injection:**  Project owners can inject malicious configurations into fluentd, which is then parsed and executed by the fluentd container.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** Attackers can leverage the injected configuration to read arbitrary files on the system.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands within the fluentd container. This could lead to further compromise of the system, including the host system as the fluentd process may run with higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration Injection:** Malicious fluentd logging configurations are injected by a project owner. This can likely be done through an API or UI, depending on Rancherâ€™s specific implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Project Owner Access:** The attacker must be a project owner within the Rancher system to exploit this vulnerability. They do not need administrative privileges on the Rancher server itself.
- **Knowledge of Fluentd Configuration:** The attacker needs some understanding of fluentd configuration syntax to create a malicious configuration.

**Affected Versions:**
- Rancher versions v2.0.0 - v2.2.3

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Rancher v2.0.15, v2.1.10, and v2.2.4 and later. Users should upgrade to these versions to mitigate the risk.
