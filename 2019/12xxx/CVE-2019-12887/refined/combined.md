[CVEID]: CVE-2019-12887
[PRODUCT]: KeyIdentity LinOTP
[VERSION]: all versions before 2.10.5.3
[PROBLEMTYPE]: CWE-305
[REFERENCES]: https://linotp.org/linotp-hotfix-autoresync.html https://linotp.org/CVE-2019-12887.txt
[DESCRIPTION]:
# CVE-2019-12887 - Replay vulnerability in LinOTP with auto resynchronization enabled for TOTP token
## Severity
KeyIdentity rates the severity level of this vulnerability as \*\*critical\*\*
(Scale: critical, high, moderate, low)
## Risk Assessment
We have reproduced and fixed a possible replay attack with activated automatic resynchronization. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to successfully log in with OTP values recorded at a previous point in time.
This attack is only possible if automatic resynchronization is enabled for the TOTP token type. The automatic resynchronization is deactivated by default. All other tokens are unaffected.
## Vulnerability
This vulnerability exists in all versions of LinOTP up to and including 2.10.5.2. It only affects TOTP tokens with activated automatic resynchronization. Automatic resynchronization is deactivated by default.
## Risk Mitigation
To address this issue we recommend to update LinOTP to 2.10.5.3
If you can not upgrade immediately, you can deactivate the automatic resynchronization (Auto Resync) to deactivate the vulnerable code path.
## Fix
LinOTP 2.10.5.3 fixes this security flaw. You can download packages for the fixed version at:
#### Debian 8 jessie
LinOTP version 2.10.5.3: https://www.linotp.org/apt/debian/dists/jessie/linotp/all/linotp\_2.10.5.3-1\_all.deb
#### Debian 9 stretch
LinOTP version 2.10.5.3: https://www.linotp.org/apt/debian/dists/stretch/linotp/all/linotp\_2.10.5.3-1\_all.deb
SVA customers can use the integrated update mechanisms to update to the newest version of LinOTP.
The patch is also available via GitHub:

# LinOTP hotfix and security advisory

KeyIdentity GmbH announces a critical vulnerability in LinOTP.
[CVE-2019-12887](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12887) was published
for this vulnerability.

KeyIdentity GmbH recommends to apply the hotfix described below for a secure operation of LinOTP if the
conditions apply.

The vulnerability is relevant if you are using TOTP (time based OATH HMAC) token and enabled the auto
resynchronization feature. Automatic resynchronization is inactive by default after installation.

With activated resynchronization it is possible to successfully log in using an OTP value recorded earlier.

The hotfix prevents this attack vector.

If you cannot update or patch immediately and have automatic resynchronization activated with TOTP token, you
should **deactivate the automatic resynchronization** until you can update. We provide
[a configuration guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-disable-autosync.html).

We explicitly thank Sébastien Foutrel for his diagnostics and valuable report for this vulnerability.

### Installation

We provide packages in different formats and versions. These packages do not contain changes beyond the hotfix
for this issue.

KeyIdentity provides an [installation guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-hotfix-autoresync.html)

the packages provided, we also provide a patch file with
a [patch guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-hotfix-autoresync.html)

### KeyIdentity LinOTP Smart Virtual Appliance

Customers using the LinOTP SVA will receive the update when automatic updates are activated. We recommend until
your scheduled automatic update to deactivate the automatic resynchronization if enabled, used with TOTP token and
you can not apply the immediate updates described above. We offer a [configuration guide](https://linotp.org/howtos/howto-disable-autosync.html).
