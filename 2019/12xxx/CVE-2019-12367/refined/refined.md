Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper configuration of the Android WebView component within the Blue Mail application. Specifically, the application sets the `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` to `True`. This allows Javascript code loaded from file URLs to access resources from any origin, including local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Javascript Injection:** The primary vulnerability is Javascript injection within the WebView. The app loads email content into a WebView, and if an attacker can control part of the email content, they can inject malicious Javascript code.
- **Universal Access Enabled:** The `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` setting allows the injected Javascript to bypass same-origin restrictions, which would otherwise limit the scope of the script's access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Theft:** Malicious Javascript can be used to steal data from the application, including potentially sensitive information such as email content, contact data, and other data accessible to the application.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While not explicitly stated to be achieved in this specific case, the combination of Javascript injection and universal access may in some scenarios, depending on the specific implementation of the app, allow for arbitrary code execution (though this seems not to be the case here).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Content:** The primary attack vector is via crafted email content. An attacker would send a malicious email containing injected Javascript code designed to execute within the Blue Mail app's WebView.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Email Access:** The attacker must be able to send or control the content of an email received by the victim using the Blue Mail application.
- **Knowledge of WebView Configuration:** The attacker needs to be aware of the application's WebView settings.
- **Malicious Script Creation:** The attacker must be able to craft Javascript that can steal data or perform other malicious actions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The document explicitly mentions that while Javascript injection doesn't always lead to arbitrary code execution, it is a severe vulnerability due to the potential for data theft.
- The content suggests that the issue stems from an improper use of `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, but there is no indication that a patch is available.
- The blog post provides CVEs for other email clients using a similar approach.
