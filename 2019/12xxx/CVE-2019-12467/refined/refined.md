Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of rate limiting on the `Special:ChangeEmail` page in MediaWiki. This allows an attacker to repeatedly change the email address associated with an account and trigger email notifications to arbitrary victim email addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness is the absence of any mechanism to limit the frequency with which a user can change an account's email address using `Special:ChangeEmail`.
*   **Bypass of Anti-Spam Measures:** The vulnerability allowed spammers to bypass typical spam prevention measures by using legitimate MediaWiki infrastructure to send out unsolicited emails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spam Dissemination:** Attackers could use this to send spam emails to a large number of victims.
*   **User Annoyance:** Victims would receive unwanted emails from Wikimedia servers, which could erode trust in the platform.
*   **Potential Blacklisting:** The abuse could lead to Wikimedia's email servers being blacklisted by email providers, affecting legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Special:ChangeEmail Page:** The attack vector is the `Special:ChangeEmail` page, which allows any user to modify the email address associated with their account.
*   **Account Creation:** Attackers would create accounts with spam content in the username, then exploit the vulnerable `Special:ChangeEmail` to send spam emails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User Account:** Attackers require only a basic MediaWiki user account.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No special administrative or system-level privileges are required.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `Special:ChangeEmail` page to carry out this attack.

**Additional Details (from Phabricator Task T209794):**

*   **Spammer Activity:**  The Phabricator task mentions specific instances of abuse where spammers registered accounts with spam messages in the username and then used `Special:ChangeEmail` to target victim addresses.
*   **Email Confirmation:** The system sends out two emails when an email is changed, one to confirm the action and a second when the email is removed or changed again. The content of these messages are as follows:
    *   Someone, probably you, from IP address xxx.xxx, has changed the email address of the account "username" to this address on Wikipedia. To confirm that this account really does belong to you...
    *   Someone, probably you from IP address xxx.xxx, has removed the address of the account "username" on Wikipedia
*   **Rate Limit Implementation:**  The fix involved implementing rate limits to the `Special:ChangeEmail` page. These limits are:
    *   Blocked users cannot change their email address.
    *   Users can change their email address a maximum of 4 times per day (except for removing).
    *   All users from a specific IP address cannot change email address more than 10 times per hour (except for removing).
*   **Initial Limits:** The initial limits implemented were 4 changes per user per day, and 10 per IP per hour, later being changed to 10 per day as well.
*  **Account Lock:** There was also discussion on locking accounts used in the attack, to further limit the impact of the vulnerability.
*   **Extent of Abuse:** The logs revealed a large number of email changes occurring within a short timeframe (332,000 changes in 7 days) , demonstrating the extent of the abuse.
*  **Mitigation:** The fix was applied to multiple MediaWiki versions (1.27.6, 1.30.2, 1.31.2, 1.32.2, and 1.33).
*  **Config Override:** There was an issue where initial rate limit configurations were being overridden in `InitialiseSettings.php`. This was resolved by adding the rate limit to the wmf specific config file.

In summary, CVE-2019-12467 highlights a vulnerability caused by a lack of rate limiting on a critical user function, leading to its abuse for spam dissemination.
