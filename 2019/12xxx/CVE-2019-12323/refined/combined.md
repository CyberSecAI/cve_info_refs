HC10 HC.Server Service 10.14

HC10 is a unified hosting automation control panel for web hosts and Cloud
based service providers to manage both Windows & Linux servers
simultaneously as part of a single cluster. HC works on an N-tier user
model.

[Vulnerability Type]
Remote Invalid Pointer Write

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2019-12323

[Security Issue]
The HC.Server service in Hosting Controller HC10 10.14 allows an Invalid
Pointer Write DoS if attackers can reach the service on port 8794.
In addition this can potentially be leveraged for post exploit persistence
with SYSTEM privileges, if physical access or malware is involved.

If a physical attacker or malware can set its own program for the service
failure recovery options, it can be used to maintain persistence.
Afterwards, it can be triggered by sending a malicious request to DoS the
service, which in turn can start the attackers recovery program.
The attackers program can then try restarting the affected service to try
an stay unnoticed by calling "sc start HCServerService".

Services failure flag recovery options for "enabling actions for stops or
errors" and can be set in the services "Recovery" properties tab
or on the command line. Authentication is not required to reach the
vulnerable service, this was tested successfully on Windows 7/10.

SERVICE_NAME: HCServerService

Microsoft Word 2016
[Vulnerability Type]
Deceptive File Reference
[References]
ZDI-CAN-7949
[Security Issue]
When a MS Word ".docx" File contains a hyperlink to another file, it will run the first file it finds in that directory with a
valid extension. But will present to the end user an extension-less file in its Security warning dialog box without showing the extension type.
If another "empty" file of the same name as the target executable exists but has no file extension. Because the extension is supressed it
makes the file seem harmless and the file can be masked to appear as just a folder etc.
This can potentially trick user into running unexpected code, but will only work when you have an additional file of same name with
NO extension on it.
[Exploit/POC]
1) Create a directory "PoC"
2) Create a folder in PoC directory named "Downloads Folder"
3) Create a .BAT file named "Downloads Folder.bat"
in the .BAT create some command like "start calc.exe"
4) Create an empty file named "Downloads Folder" with no file extension
5) Create the Word ".docx" file with a hyperlink pointing to "PoC/Downloads Folder/Downloads Folder"
Upon opening the link Word will give user an vague dialog box about asking if they want to open
the file. However, the prompt shows an apparent folder structure and no file extension .exe, .com etc
are visible or displayed to the end user.
Click the link to open what looks to be a folder then BOOM! the .BAT file runs instead.
Of course any exeuctable will do .EXE etc.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
