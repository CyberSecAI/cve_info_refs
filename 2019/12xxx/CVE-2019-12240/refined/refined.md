- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "virim" (version 0.4) is vulnerable to insecure deserialization because it passes attacker-controlled data from the $_GET parameters to the `unserialize()` function without sanitization. Specifically, the `s_values`, `t_values`, and `c_values` parameters are unserialized.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization vulnerability. The plugin takes user-supplied input and uses it in PHP's `unserialize()` function.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. By crafting malicious serialized data, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable WordPress plugin.

- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP GET requests. Attackers can manipulate the `s_values`, `t_values`, and `c_values` parameters in the URL to inject malicious serialized data. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the server where the vulnerable WordPress plugin is installed. No special privileges or prior access is required.
