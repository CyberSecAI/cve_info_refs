Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of session tokens by LemonLDAP::NG when the `tokenUseGlobalStorage` option is enabled. Specifically, tokens meant for one-time use or specific contexts (like CSRF, SAML/OIDC, or self-registration) could be used to create valid but anonymous sessions when stored in the main session database. This happens because the session kind ("SSO") is set incorrectly for these tokens and not checked properly during session retrieval.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Inadequate Session Token Validation:** The system does not properly validate the type or context of session tokens when retrieved from the session database, particularly when `tokenUseGlobalStorage` is enabled.
2.  **Incorrect Session Kind:** Tokens not meant for standard user sessions (e.g., CSRF tokens, SAML/OIDC tokens, registration tokens) are being stored with a session kind ("SSO") that allows them to be used as valid user sessions.
3.  **Anonymous Session Creation:** By exploiting this weakness, an attacker can create an anonymous session with minimal information, bypassing authentication mechanisms and gaining unauthorized access to resources.
4. **Missing session kind verification:** The handler doesn't check the session kind when retrieving the session, allowing the use of tokens for different purposes to impersonate a valid session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the LemonLDAP::NG portal and protected applications without proper authentication.
*   **Bypass of Access Rules:**  Anonymous sessions can bypass access rules, particularly those that do not handle empty user information correctly.
*   **Data Exposure:** Although the created session is empty, the attacker can browse application lists and potentially access applications that lack proper access control rules.
*   **Account Takeover (Indirectly):**  Although an attacker cannot takeover an existing account, the vulnerabilities related to SAML/OIDC and register tokens can lead to exploitation of anonymous sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF Token Exploitation:** If CSRF tokens are stored in the global session database, they can be used to create an anonymous session, provided the `tokenUseGlobalStorage` option is enabled.
*   **SAML/OIDC Token Exploitation:** Similarly, SAML/OIDC tokens stored in the session database can be used to create anonymous sessions.
*   **Self-Registration Token Exploitation:** Tokens used in the self-registration process, such as mail confirmation tokens, can be exploited to create anonymous sessions.
*   **Direct Session Token Use:** By directly using a token value (e.g., from a request or logs) as a `lemonldap` cookie value, an attacker can create an anonymous session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Token:** The attacker needs access to a valid token generated by LemonLDAP::NG (CSRF, SAML/OIDC, registration, or any token stored with `tokenUseGlobalStorage` enabled).
*   **Basic HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, as demonstrated by the `curl` examples provided in the reports, including setting cookies.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need to have a valid account or authenticate through the regular login process to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Target URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the protected application or the portal itself to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is specific to configurations using session storage in the main session database (enabled by `tokenUseGlobalStorage`).
*   The issue was discovered during an internal audit by a LemonLDAP::NG developer.
*   Patches were created for affected versions (1.3.3, 1.9.7 and 2.0.x), and included tests to ensure the fixes were effective.
*   The fix includes checks for the session kind (e.g., "SSO", "CDA") to prevent tokens from being used in incorrect contexts.
*   A test script (llng-1742-test.sh) was provided to check for the vulnerability.
* The `_session_kind` attribute is added to the tokens when they are stored using `tokenUseGlobalStorage` which is the root cause of the issue as it's not properly checked.
