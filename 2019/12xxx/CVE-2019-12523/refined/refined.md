Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in the URI processor of Squid. Specifically, when handling a URN request, a corresponding HTTP request is made. This HTTP request bypasses access checks applied to incoming HTTP requests, resulting in security bypass.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Security bypass:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass access control checks, potentially gaining access to restricted HTTP servers that should not be accessible to them (e.g., servers listening only on localhost)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Access to restricted servers:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to resources they shouldn't be able to reach, such as those protected by client IP ACLs or those listening only on localhost.
- **Denial of service:** Though not explicitly stated as part of CVE-2019-12523, some of the documents indicate the improper input validation can lead to a buffer overflow that can cause a denial-of-service (this is explicitly tied to CVE-2019-18676 in some docs).
- **Access to manager services:** With the 'via' header turned off, attackers could potentially access manager services.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted URN request to a vulnerable Squid proxy server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Squid server. There is no mention of required authentication, meaning an unauthenticated attacker is likely able to exploit this.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects Squid versions 3.x up to 3.5.28 and 4.x up to 4.8. The fix is present in version 4.9.
- A workaround is mentioned for preventing access to manager services by enabling the Via header (`via on`).
- There is no reliable workaround to prevent access to restricted upstream servers or the denial-of-service condition.
