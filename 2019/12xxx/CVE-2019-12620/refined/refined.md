Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient authentication for the statistics collection service within Cisco HyperFlex Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper authentication controls for the statistics collection service allows unauthorized access.
- This allows for the injection of arbitrary data values by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values into the statistics data.
- This results in the web interface statistics view presenting invalid or manipulated data to users. This could lead to confusion, inaccurate monitoring, and potentially mask malicious activity.
- The impact is limited to integrity; confidentiality and availability are not affected based on the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
- The attacker does not need any authentication credentials or privileges.
- The attacker needs to send properly formatted data values to the vulnerable statistics collection service.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- The affected products include Cisco HyperFlex Software releases 3.5.2f and earlier, and 4.0.1b and earlier.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
