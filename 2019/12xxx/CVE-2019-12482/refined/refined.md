Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-12482:

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

The provided documents describe 4 distinct vulnerabilities within the GPAC multimedia framework, specifically in version 0.7.1, and are fixed in version 0.5.0+svn5324~dfsg1-1+deb8u4:
* **CVE-2019-12481:** This CVE is associated with a NULL pointer dereference in the `DumpTrackInfo` function at `filedump.c:2058-65`.
* **CVE-2019-12482:** This CVE is associated with a NULL pointer dereference in the `gf_isom_get_original_format_type` function at `drm_sample.c:540-33`.
* **CVE-2019-12483:** This CVE is associated with a NULL pointer dereference in the `GetESD` function at `track.c:271-28`.
* A heap-based buffer overflow in the `ReadGF_IPMPX_RemoveToolNotificationListener` function at `ipmpx_code.c:1103-54`.

**Detailed Analysis:**

1.  **NULL Pointer Dereference in `DumpTrackInfo` (CVE-2019-12481):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `DumpTrackInfo` function attempts to access `esd->decoderConfig->streamType` without properly checking if `esd->decoderConfig` is a valid pointer. When `esd->decoderConfig` is NULL, it leads to a dereference of a null pointer.
    *   **Vulnerability:** NULL pointer dereference.
    *   **Impact:** Crash of the application due to segmentation fault.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted MP4 file that results in a null `decoderConfig` pointer.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to supply a malformed MP4 file to the vulnerable application.

2.  **NULL Pointer Dereference in `gf_isom_get_original_format_type` (CVE-2019-12482):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The function `gf_isom_get_original_format_type` accesses `sinf->original_format` without ensuring `sinf` or `sinf->original_format` are valid pointers. When sinf is NULL, it causes a null pointer dereference.
    *   **Vulnerability:** NULL pointer dereference.
    *   **Impact:** Crash of the application due to segmentation fault.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted MP4 file that triggers a null `sinf` pointer.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to supply a malformed MP4 file to the vulnerable application.

3.  **NULL Pointer Dereference in `GetESD` (CVE-2019-12483):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `GetESD` function accesses `esd->decoderConfig->streamType` without validating if `esd->decoderConfig` is a valid pointer. When `esd->decoderConfig` is NULL, this results in a null pointer dereference.
    *   **Vulnerability:** NULL pointer dereference.
    *   **Impact:** Crash of the application due to a segmentation fault.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted MP4 file that triggers a null `decoderConfig` pointer.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to supply a malformed MP4 file to the vulnerable application.

4.  **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in `ReadGF_IPMPX_RemoveToolNotificationListener`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `ReadGF_IPMPX_RemoveToolNotificationListener` function reads a value `p->eventTypeCount` from the input data and then iterates based on this count, writing to `p->eventType[i]`. If `eventTypeCount` is greater than the size of `eventType`, a heap-based buffer overflow occurs.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to arbitrary code execution if carefully exploited, also causing a crash due to memory corruption.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting an MP4 file where the eventTypeCount field is larger than the allocated buffer size.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to supply a malformed MP4 file to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerabilities were found through fuzzing.
*   The affected software is `MP4Box` from the GPAC framework.
*   The vulnerabilities were present in version 0.7.1 and were fixed in version 0.5.0+svn5324~dfsg1-1+deb8u4 for Debian 8 "Jessie".
*   A proof of concept (POC) for these vulnerabilities is available at [https://github.com/TeamSeri0us/pocs/tree/master/gpac/MP4Box/vuln](https://github.com/TeamSeri0us/pocs/tree/master/gpac/MP4Box/vuln).

**Summary:**

The vulnerabilities in GPAC, specifically the NULL pointer dereferences and heap-based buffer overflow, can be exploited by providing specially crafted MP4 files. These vulnerabilities could lead to denial-of-service through application crashes and possibly arbitrary code execution.
