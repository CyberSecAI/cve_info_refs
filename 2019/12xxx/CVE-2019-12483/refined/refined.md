Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-12483:

**Vulnerability:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow
**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `ReadGF_IPMPX_RemoveToolNotificationListener` function in `ipmpx_code.c`. The function reads an `eventTypeCount` from the input bitstream and then iterates based on this count, writing to the `eventType` array without proper bounds checking, potentially overflowing the allocated buffer.
**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking during array access.
  - Unvalidated `eventTypeCount` value from the input stream can lead to out-of-bounds write.
**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.
  - Denial-of-service (DoS) due to program crash.
**Attack Vectors:**
  - Processing a specially crafted MP4 file that has a large eventTypeCount in the IPMPX data.
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker must be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application (`MP4Box`).

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is:
  ```c
    1102 	p->eventTypeCount = gf_bs_read_int(bs, 8);
    1103 	for (i=0; i<p->eventTypeCount; i++) p->eventType[i] = gf_bs_read_int(bs, 8);
  ```
- The loop at line 1103 reads an integer from the bitstream using `gf_bs_read_int(bs, 8)` and writes it into the `eventType` array. The size of `eventType` is not verified against `eventTypeCount`.
- The `eventType` array is defined as `u8 eventType[16]` inside `GF_IPMPX_RemoveToolNotificationListener` which means it can hold at most 16 bytes, when the `eventTypeCount` is more than that, a heap buffer overflow will happen.
- The provided crash report also indicates a heap-buffer-overflow at the same location.
- This vulnerability can be triggered through `MP4Box -info @@` with a crafted MP4 file that contains a large `eventTypeCount` value.
