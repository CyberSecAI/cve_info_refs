{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Sangoma SBC web application uses the `Execute` function, which applies `escapeshellcmd` to sanitize shell characters but fails to prevent the injection of additional arguments to the `/usr/local/sng/bin/sng-user-mgmt` script. This allows an attacker to pass malicious commands as part of the username.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Argument Injection or Modification (CWE-88)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can create a local user with sudo privileges on the system. This grants the attacker full control over the affected system, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and potentially compromise the entire network.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is the web application's login interface. The attacker injects additional arguments into the username field during the login process.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to access the web application's login interface. No prior authentication or specialized tools are required."
