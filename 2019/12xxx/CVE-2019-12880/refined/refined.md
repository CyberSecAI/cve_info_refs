Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper configuration of the `web_accessible_resources` in the Quarking Password Manager extension, specifically by using `*`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a clickjacking vulnerability. The use of `*` in `web_accessible_resources` makes all extension resources accessible to any webpage. This allows an attacker to embed the password manager's interface in an iframe on their website, and trick a user into interacting with the legitimate interface while believing they are interacting with the attacker's page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially steal passwords or other sensitive data by tricking the user into interacting with the password manager through an attacker-controlled interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious website. An attacker would create a website that embeds the vulnerable password manager extension in an iframe, overlaying it with deceptive elements, tricking the user to interact with the hidden, real UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create a website or control a website the victim is likely to visit. The victim must also have the vulnerable Quarking Password Manager extension installed in their browser.
