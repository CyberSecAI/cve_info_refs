Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from **improper input validation and authorization** of specific commands within the Cisco IOS XE Software CLI. This allows an attacker to execute commands that should not be permitted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate the commands entered by users through the CLI.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The system does not enforce proper authorization controls, allowing a user with local access to execute commands they shouldn't.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The ability to write arbitrary values to memory is possible by exploiting this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Configuration Modification:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the device's configuration in a way that makes it non-secure.
*   **Abnormal Functioning:** The exploitation could lead to abnormal behavior of the affected device.
*   **Integrity Impact:** The attacker can modify the device's configuration causing a high integrity impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
*   **CLI Exploitation:**  The attacker exploits the vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing specific, crafted commands through the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Local User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the affected device with the ability to use the CLI.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Commands:**  The attacker needs to know which specific commands trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects devices running IOS XE Polaris Releases 16.x and later.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
*   This vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 5.5 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N. This indicates a local attack vector, low complexity, low privileges required, no user interaction, unchanged scope, no confidentiality impact, high integrity impact, and no availability impact.

The vulnerability allows for memory corruption through the CLI, leading to potentially severe impacts on the device's operation and security.
