Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the RAR file syntax by the Cisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect parsing/detection of RAR file syntax within the detection engine. This leads to the system not recognizing a malicious RAR file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass configured Malware and File Policies for RAR file types.
- This allows malicious RAR files to pass through the targeted device without being inspected or blocked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a malicious RAR file through the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to a vulnerable Cisco Firepower device.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious RAR file that exploits the parsing flaw.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the detection of RAR files.
- The content specifically mentions that the vulnerability is independent of CVE-2019-12697.
- A CVSS score of 5.8 is provided, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
