{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `status.cgi` script on Fastweb Fastgate devices improperly sanitizes user-supplied input in the `mount` parameter when handling the `usb_remove` service. Specifically, the script fails to block the `&` character, allowing for command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Command injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/status.cgi` endpoint, including the malicious command in the `mount` parameter. The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the router, which is usually on the local network.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, typically requiring network access to the device's local network. Additionally, they need to be able to obtain valid XSRF-TOKEN and sessionKey."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "exploit_script_details": "The provided exploit script demonstrates how to obtain the XSRF-TOKEN and sessionKey, send the crafted GET request containing the malicious command in the 'mount' parameter via the `usb_remove` service to achieve code execution, and then logout. The script is written in Python and uses the requests library.",
    "patch_details": "The patch involves removing checks for special characters by simply checking if the folder exists in the usb_remove service, preventing the command injection."
