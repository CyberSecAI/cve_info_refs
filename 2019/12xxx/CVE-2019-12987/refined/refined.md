CVE-2019-12987: /Collector/storagemgmt/apply Unauthenticated Command Injection
- Vulnerability: The "apply" action in StorageMgmtController is susceptible to command injection by a remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Root cause: The callStoragePerl function does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values that are used to construct a shell command.
- Attack vector: By routing traffic through the Collector controller and supplying an array value with crafted values for 'action', 'host', 'path', or 'type'.
- Impact: Since the 'www-data' user has been given 'sudo' privileges, the vulnerability can be exploited to gain root access.
