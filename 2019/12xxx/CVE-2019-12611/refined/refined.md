- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper memory management in the `miniupnpd` component of Bitdefender BOX firmware. Specifically, the device allocates memory but fails to free it when processing specially crafted packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak due to failure to free allocated memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The memory leak can lead to the crash of the `miniupnpd` component or a device reboot, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted packets to the `miniupnpd` implementation in Bitdefender BOX.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be present within the Bitdefender BOX network.
