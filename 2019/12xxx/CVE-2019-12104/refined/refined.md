Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the `qcmap_web_cgi` binary of the TP-Link M7350 (V3) firmware. This occurs because user-supplied input is passed to the `popen` function without proper sanitization. Specifically, the "language" parameter within the `webServer` module's API can be manipulated to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject shell commands through the "language" parameter. The application uses `snprintf` to construct a command string using user-provided data and then passes it to the `popen` function, leading to arbitrary command execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize or validate the "language" parameter before using it in a shell command.
*   **Pre-Authentication Exploitation (CVE-2019-12103):** Although the primary focus is on CVE-2019-12104, the article states that this vulnerability exists *after* authentication, but the vulnerability is very similar to CVE-2019-12103 which is pre-authentication and can be exploited via CSRF.
*   **Exposed Web Interface:** The web interface, intended for configuration, is accessible and allows for these actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the device. This can allow for complete control of the device including the ability to open backdoors or further compromise the network.
*   **Device Compromise:** The attacker can modify device settings, potentially creating a permanent backdoor.
*   **Network Access:** With RCE, an attacker could gain access to the network the device is connected to and potentially pivot to other devices on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/qcmap_web_cgi` endpoint.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  A malicious website can be used to send the malicious POST request.
*   **Local Network Access:** Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have some form of access to its web interface. This could be by LAN or an poorly configured APN.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device's web interface. This could be through the local network or from the internet depending on the device's configuration.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP POST requests.
*   **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs to understand the `qcmap_web_cgi` endpoint and its expected JSON format to target the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found through reverse engineering the device firmware with Ghidra.
*   TP-Link released firmware version 190531 to fix this vulnerability, which involves escaping the format string with single quotes in the `snprintf` function.
*   The original post also mentions that the vendor was slow to respond, with several contact attempts required before a response.
*   The vulnerability described is a post-authentication vulnerability (CVE-2019-12104), but the blog post also discusses CVE-2019-12103, which is a very similar pre-authentication vulnerability on the same device.
*   The blog post also provides a proof of concept JavaScript code for CSRF exploitation.
