Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12291:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Consul's Access Control List (ACL) system handles prefix matching for key/value (KV) store access. Specifically, when evaluating a token's write access to a KV prefix, Consul incorrectly bypasses the default deny policy if no specific prefix rule is found.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Fallback Behavior:** Instead of falling back to the default policy (usually 'deny') when no matching prefix rule is found, Consul continues to the next step in the ACL check which can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Insufficient Prefix Matching:** The vulnerability is triggered when an ACL rule uses `key_prefix` or `key` to grant partial write access to the KV store.
- **Default Deny Bypass:** The intended behavior of the default deny is bypassed, leading to unexpected write access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Deletion:** Attackers with a token using a vulnerable policy could delete keys in the KV store even if they don't have explicit permission for those keys. This is a major impact because data loss could occur, and the expected access control mechanisms would not function as intended.
- **Potential Service Disruption:** Due to the potential for deleting key-value pairs, this could lead to service disruption if critical data is deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **ACL Token Exploitation:** An attacker would need to obtain a valid ACL token that has been granted a specific prefix permission.
- **Specific Policy Configuration:** This only occurs with policies that grant partial write access via the `key_prefix` or `key` rules in combination with a default deny policy configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid ACL Token:** The attacker must possess a valid ACL token that has partial write access to the KV store using a `key_prefix` or `key` rule.
- **Consul 1.4.0 - 1.5.0:** The vulnerability is present in Consul versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.0 (both OSS and Enterprise).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered while investigating another issue (#5819).
- The fix requires either upgrading to Consul 1.4.5 or 1.5.1 or adding a temporary ACL rule `key_prefix "" { policy = "deny" }` to any affected policies.
- The vulnerability exists because of an incorrect evaluation order of ACL rules.
- The issue lies in the first step of the ACL check where it fails to fall back to the default deny if no applicable rules are found
- The documentation in the content provides a detailed explanation of the issue and how to remediate it including the specific ACL rule that should be added
