  "CVE-2019-12456": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the MPT3COMMAND case in _ctl_ioctl_main in drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_ctl.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by changing the value of ioc_number between two kernel reads of that value, aka a \"double fetch\" vulnerability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ioc_number` value is read from user space, then the code uses that to obtain a pointer to the ioc struct, then performs a second read, without validating if the value is the same.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Double fetch vulnerability, where a value is read from user space multiple times without proper validation in between. This allows for a race condition and potential modification of the value by an attacker.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. A malicious user can change the value of ioc_number between the two reads which will lead to unexpected behavior.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local unprivileged user must be able to call the affected ioctl. The attacker can change value of ioc_number during the ioctl processing."
