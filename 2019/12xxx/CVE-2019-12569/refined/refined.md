Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12569:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Unsafe search paths used by the Viber for Desktop application's URI handler in Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The application's URI handler does not properly validate or sanitize the paths it uses when loading libraries. This allows the application to potentially load libraries from user-controlled locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the targeted user.
*   By placing a crafted malicious library in a location reachable through a crafted URI link, the attacker can force the vulnerable application to load the malicious library, leading to code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through malicious URI links.
*   An attacker needs to convince the targeted user to follow a crafted malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to create and host malicious URI links.
*   The attacker must be able to place a malicious library in a directory that can be accessed through the malicious URI link.
*   The attacker must be able to socially engineer the victim to click the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Viber for Desktop versions 10.5.0.23 and older for Windows.
*   The vendor released a patch in version 10.7.0 which addresses this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Hashim Jawad of ACTIVELabs.
