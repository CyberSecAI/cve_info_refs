Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `WatchedItemStore::countVisitingWatchersMultiple()` function in MediaWiki.
- When called with an empty array as the `$targetsWithVisitThresholds` parameter, instead of returning no results, it queries *all* titles in the `watchlist` table without a WHERE clause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unintended Behavior:** The function does not behave as expected when an empty array is passed.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The function does not properly validate the input, leading to the execution of a potentially resource-intensive query.
- **Missing WHERE Clause:** The generated SQL query lacks a WHERE clause, forcing a full table scan of the `watchlist` table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** This can cause a denial of service by overloading the database server due to the excessive query.
- **Performance Degradation:** The large query can slow down database performance affecting the entire application.
- **Outage:** The vulnerability can cause an outage by making the database unresponsive and/or crashing the database server if the query is repeatedly sent and not killed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `ApiQueryInfo` API module when a request includes `action=query`, `prop=info`, and the `visitingwatchers` option, and the titles passed are invalid resulting in an empty `$targetsWithVisitThresholds` array.
- **Malicious API Requests:** An attacker can craft API requests with invalid titles to trigger the slow query and cause a DoS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to API:** The attacker needs to be able to make API requests to the MediaWiki instance.
- **Understanding of API:** The attacker should be familiar with the parameters to send in order to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- **No Authentication Necessary:** The provided text doesn't mention that authentication is required.

**Additional Information:**

- **Patch:** Patches were released to address this issue by preventing the query from executing when the `$targetsWithVisitThresholds` array is empty.
- **Query Killer:** A temporary measure was implemented using a query killer to terminate slow `WatchedItemStore::countVisitingWatchersMultiple` queries.
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability was present in MediaWiki versions: master, 1.31.0, 1.31.0-rc.2, 1.31.0-rc.1, 1.31.0-rc.0, 1.30.0, 1.30.0-rc.0, 1.29.2, 1.29.1, 1.29.0, 1.29.0-rc.1, 1.29.0-rc.0, 1.28.3, 1.28.2, 1.28.1, 1.28.0, 1.28.0-rc.1, 1.28.0-rc.0, 1.27.4, 1.27.3, 1.27.2, 1.27.1, 1.27.0, 1.27.0-rc.1, and 1.27.0-rc.0.
- **Fix:** The fix was backported to stable MediaWiki releases 1.31, 1.30 and 1.27.
- **CVE assignment:** The issue was assigned CVE-2019-12473 due to the potential DoS attack.
