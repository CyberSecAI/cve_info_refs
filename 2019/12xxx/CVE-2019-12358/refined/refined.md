The provided text details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in zzcms 2019. Specifically, it outlines the following:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of input sanitization on the `id` parameter in multiple PHP files. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. The code checks for the presence of a comma (`,`) in the `id` parameter, and if found, proceeds to use the unsanitized `id` value directly in the SQL query without proper quoting or escaping.
*   **Affected Files:**
    *   `user/dls_print.php`
    *   `user/dls_download.php`
    *   `dl/dl_sendmail.php`
    *   `dl/dl_sendsms.php`
    *   `admin/deluser.php`
    *   `admin/dl_sendmail.php`
    *   `admin/showbad.php`
    *   `admin/ztliuyan_sendmail.php`
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `id` parameter (either via POST or COOKIE depending on the file) to include SQL injection payloads. In `dl/dl_sendmail.php` and `dl/dl_sendsms.php`, the `dlid` COOKIE is vulnerable if the GET parameter `n` has a non-zero value.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Data modification/deletion
    *   Authentication bypass
    *   Remote code execution (in certain circumstances, depending on database configuration).
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints, modifying the `id` parameter or the `dlid` cookie as needed. No authentication is explicitly required for some of the exploits (e.g. `user/dls_print.php`, `user/dls_download.php`, `dl/dl_sendmail.php`, `dl/dl_sendsms.php`), while others require admin privileges (`admin/*`).
*   **Payload Examples:** The report provides specific examples of SQL injection payloads, including UNION-based injections and time-based injections (using `sleep()`).

    *   `id[0]=1) union select 1234,@@version-- a,` (in `/admin/deluser.php`)
    *   `COOKIE['dlid'] = 1) union select sleep(3)-- a,` (in `/dl/dl_sendmail.php?n=1234`)
    *   `id[0]=2342342) || IF((1=1),sleep(3),2)-- a,` (in `/admin/showbad.php?action=del`)
*   **Weakness:** CWE-89 "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
