      "root_cause": "The `drm_load_edid_firmware` function in `drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c` in the Linux kernel does not properly check the return value of `kstrdup`. When `kstrdup` fails and returns a NULL pointer, the code proceeds to dereference that NULL pointer which can cause a denial-of-service (system crash).",

        "Improper handling of NULL pointer return from memory allocation function `kstrdup`."
