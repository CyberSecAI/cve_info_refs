Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Mikogo service client component runs with SYSTEM privileges on Windows systems.
- When the Mikogo GUI component is launched by a user, it inherits SYSTEM privileges from the service.
- The GUI component allows access to arbitrary files and execution of other programs, which also inherit SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Privilege escalation due to improper privilege inheritance.
- Lack of sufficient privilege separation between the service and GUI components.
- Ability to execute arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges through the GUI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user can escalate their privileges to the SYSTEM level, gaining administrative control over the system.
- This allows an attacker to perform any action an administrator can, including installing software, modifying system settings, and accessing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to a Windows system with the vulnerable version of Mikogo installed.
- Exploitation through the Mikogo GUI component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Basic user privileges on a target machine.
- Ability to launch the Mikogo GUI.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Mikogo versions prior to 5.10.2.
- The fix is available in version 5.10.2 and above.
- The vendor recommends updating affected installations immediately.
