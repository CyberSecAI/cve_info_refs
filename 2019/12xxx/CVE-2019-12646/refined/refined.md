### CVE-2019-12646

The content is related to CVE-2019-12646.

**Vulnerability Description:** A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation (NAT) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Application Layer Gateway (ALG) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.

*   **Root Cause:** Improper processing of transient SIP packets on which NAT is performed.
*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the NAT SIP ALG of Cisco IOS XE Software due to improper processing of SIP packets.
*   **Attack vector:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP packets through an affected device performing NAT for SIP packets, using UDP port 5060.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco 1100, 4200, and 4300 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs), Cisco Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000V Series, Cisco Enterprise Network Compute System (ENCS), and Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv) when running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software configured for NAT operation.
*   **Mitigation:** Disable the SIP ALG by configuring `no ip nat service sip udp port 5060` on the affected device.
*   **Indicators of Compromise:** A successful exploit will cause the affected device to reload and generate a crashinfo file. Decoding the stack trace may reveal correlation with this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds that directly address the vulnerability, but disabling the SIP ALG can mitigate the risk.
