Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Improper resource allocation when processing TCP packets directed to the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability lies in how Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Catalyst 4000 Series Switches handles incoming TCP packets.
*   Specifically, the issue is improper resource allocation which leads to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit results in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
*   The affected device runs out of buffer resources, impairing the operation of control and management plane protocols.
*   The device may stop accepting and processing unicast IP packets destined for it.
*   Protocols like BGP, which rely on unicast IP traffic, may stop functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted TCP streams to the affected device.
*   The attack must be directed at the device itself and cannot be performed by sending traffic through it.
*   The attacker must establish TCP connections to an open TCP port on the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send TCP packets to the target device.
*   The attacker must establish a TCP connection to an open port on the device.
*   The attacker must be able to send crafted TCP streams.
*   Spoofed IP addresses cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6-E
*   Cisco Catalyst 4500 Supervisor Engine 6L-E
*   Cisco Catalyst 4900M Switch
*   Cisco Catalyst 4948E Ethernet Switch
*  Cisco Catalyst 4948E-F Ethernet Switch

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco IOS Software; Cisco IOS XE, IOS XR, and NX-OS are not affected.
*   No workarounds are available to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the issue.
*   The vulnerability is rated as HIGH severity with a CVSS base score of 8.6.
*  The advisory was released on September 25, 2019.
