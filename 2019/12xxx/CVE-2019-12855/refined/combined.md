# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

### @ralphm **[ralphm](/ralphm)** commented [May 27, 2019](#issue-448806542)

<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9561>

Replaces [#1084](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1084).

While setting up XMPP connections, during StartTLS, an unconfigured `CertificationOptions` instance is passed. These changes properly use `optionsForClientTLS` instead, using the remote server's domain (`XmlStream.otherJID`, taken from the JID the client is connecting with) to verify the remote certificate using the platform trust root and that domain.

Additionally, you can now pass custom certificate options to modify this new default, e.g. for using client certificates with SASL External.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This adds an option `required` argument to the inits of initializers

Additionally it changes the requiredness of two initializers used by
XMPPAuthenticator:

is not advertized by the server, initialization fails instead of
silently proceeding to authentication without encryption.
* Binding a resource is required by default, because without it servers
will not allow any further meaningful interaction.")`

Minor feedback inline; the biggest deal here is the public-interface changes (the naming and public-ness of `contextFactory`). Address as you see fit, and file follow-ups for anything you think should be dealt with later, then land!

Sorry, something went wrong.

There are lots of other places which do this conditional import. Can we piggyback on one of them rather than adding bespoke `ImportError`-handling logic? My concern here is that this type of exception handling is likely to mask cases where there's an actual import-time bug in `twisted.internet.ssl` and I don't want to have to go looking for 20 instances of this if we ever manage to go in and fix it to only fail on defined import errors (i.e. those where `cryptography` isn't available).

Worst case, I'd rather literally import it from another `test_` module for the time being.

I suppose this is due to the unconditional import of the `OpenSSL` module in `twisted.internet.ssl` and `twisted.internet._sslverify`. The former module does have a `supported` attribute, but it seems to (at least now) always be set to True, even though for example `twisted.words.protocols.jabber.xmlstream` checks for that.

If the `OpenSSL` module cannot be imported, the whole import fails, wheres I think my tests probably don't even use it.

Can we not make `twisted.internet.ssl` do this conditional import and have it set `supported` to `False`, and `SSL` to `None`?

| I work on GitHub's security workflows team and am looking into how we can make it easier for maintainers to publicise security vulnerabilities like this one. I'd love your feedback if you have 5 mins?  Specifically:   * GitHub sent alerts to Twisted users about this vulnerability, and in some cases automated security fix PRs. Could we have done anything better there? * did you consider using the "Maintainer Security Advisories" feature to publicise this vulnerability (it's in the "Security" tab on this repo)? What would make that feature useful to you in future? * do you have any other thoughts on the process of handling a security vulnerability, and how GitHub can help?   We're trying to make the process easier so if you have any feedback at all please let me know. You can email me on greysteil@github.com if you'd like to discuss anything privately. |

| Hi Grey,  Here's some off the cuff thoughts:   * I'd be surprised if GitHub could send a fix PR for this, I don't believe this PR has been included in a release yet. * We need to obtain CVEs for vulnerabilities, so unless GitHub can obtain them for us, using the Maintainer Security Advisories feature is duplicative. * Twisted is a large project and only a fraction of its users use XMPP, if there was some way to only notify users who were impacted by this specific vulnerability, as opposed to using an effected version, that'd be fantastic.   In general I'm super thrilled about GitHub automatically issuing notifications on insecure dependencies. |

| Oops! Thought it had been. We'll create fix PRs when it is :-)  One thing that would make this kind of thing easier to track is explicit "present in releases" state on issues and PRs. If even people who *work at github* can't tell whether a PR has made it into a release or not, that says something about the UI for this 😄 .  (In fairness, Twisted's processes predate like, neolithic information technology so we don't lean particularly heavily on the Github notion of a release, or use Github issues for tracking in this project; still, if the ability to track what releases an issue was fixed in or a PR was present in, that would be a *big* motivation to migrate.) |

| * Could we have done anything better there?  For projects hosted on github, or even just with an official mirror here, it would be helpful if whatever notification-automation were integrated directly into the Maintainer Security Advisories tab. For example, if Github were to misidentify some element of the state associated with the PR (as you potentially did with the mistake around this being included in a release), we could go in and edit the advisory directly.  Based on the workflow I've seen so far, what I think I am asking for more specifically here is "please create a draft maintainer security advisory that we can see and comment on with at least *some* window before you put us on blast to our entire user base". |

If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1728206#c18)  Anten Skrabec    2021-03-29 18:03:31 UTC  ``` Statement:  * This issue affects the version of calamari-server(embeds python-twisted) as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 as it does not check for TLS certificate. * This issue did not affect the versions of python-twisted-core as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3 as it does not ship XMPP XML Stream bits.  This issue affects the versions of python-twisted-words as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.  Red Hat OpenStack Platform:                                                                                                                  * This flaw depends on the use of the XMPP protocol, which is not used in Red Hat OpenStack Platform. Although updating is recommended for affected versions, Red Hat OpenStack Platform environments are not vulnerable. Because of this and the lower product impact, no fixes will be issued for any Red Hat OpenStack Platform version at this time. * Because the flaw's impact is Low, it will not be fixed in Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 which will retire shortly after the public date.   ``` |  |

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  5 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2633852.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2633852.1).

## Details

it was discovered that Twisted incorrectly validated or sanitized certain

URIs or HTTP methods. A remote attacker could use this issue to inject

invalid characters and possibly perform header injection attacks.

([CVE-2019-12387](/security/CVE-2019-12387))

It was discovered that Twisted incorrectly verified XMPP TLS certificates.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack and obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-12855](/security/CVE-2019-12855))

It was discovered that Twisted incorrectly handled HTTP/2 connections. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Twisted to hang or

consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-9512](/security/CVE-2019-9512), [CVE-2019-9514](/security/CVE-2019-9514),

[CVE-2019-9515](/security/CVE-2019-9515))

Jake Miller and ZeddYu Lu discovered that Twisted incorrectly handled

certain content-length headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to perform HTTP request splitting attacks. ([CVE-2020-10108](/security/CVE-2020-10108),

[CVE-2020-10109](/security/CVE-2020-10109))
