## Description

![@jamesagnew](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3465117?u=e0764f4bf89c5ea416df81bbca45f9995bc89bf5&v=4&size=48)[jamesagnew](https://github.com/jamesagnew)opened [on Jun 5, 2019](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/issues/1335#issue-452533525)

This is a public tracking ticket to document the fix for an XSS exploit reported by Mudit Punia and Dushyant Garg.

The issue has been corrected in HAPI FHIR 3.8.0 via the following commit: [8f41159#diff-a64fc451d8988d1d97d8488edca3b15d](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir/commit/8f41159eb147eeb964cad68b28eff97acac6ea9a#diff-a64fc451d8988d1d97d8488edca3b15d)

In this issue, when using the hapi-fhir-testpage-overlay (the testing UI most known for its display on <http://hapi.fhir.org> ) several URL parameters are not sanitized. This could lead to information disclosure (such as cookies) via a specially crafted URL.

**May 30, 2019 - HAPI FHIR 3.8.0 (Hippo) Released** -
The next release of HAPI has now been uploaded to the Maven repos and
GitHub's releases section.

This release features a number of significant performance improvements,
and has some notable changes:

* A new interceptor framework has been added. Existing interceptors will continue to work, and no code changes
  are needed in order to use this new version, but existing interceptors can be modified to use the new
  framework and can then take advantage of even more functionality. Updated migration documentation will be
  produced in the coming weeks.
* A security issue in the hapi-fhir-testpage-overlay (the web-based testing UI that powers
  [hapi.fhir.org](http://hapi.fhir.org) and can be embedded into other applications)
  has been corrected. Users of this module are recommended to upgrade right away.
* The
  [hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter)
  project now uses a properties file for much easier configuration. Please use this project
  as the basis for any new JPA Server projects, as we are deprecating the existing
  duplicate
  [hapi-fhir-jpaserver-example](https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/tree/master/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-example)
  project.
* A number of improvements have been made to the validator.

As always, see the
[changelog](http://hapifhir.io/changes-report.html) for a full list
of changes.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release!
