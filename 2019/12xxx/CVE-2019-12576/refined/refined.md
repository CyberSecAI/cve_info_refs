CVE-2019-12576
```

The provided text gives a detailed analysis of CVE-2019-12576. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Vulnerability:** Privilege Escalation
*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v82 for macOS allows a local attacker to run arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Root Cause:** The `openvpn_launcher` binary, which is setuid root, calls the `networksetup` utility using relative paths. The PATH environment is not reset before executing this OS utility.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local, unprivileged user can create a malicious `networksetup` executable (a trojan). By manipulating the PATH environment variable to include the directory containing the trojan before the legitimate system paths, the attacker can ensure that their malicious `networksetup` is executed instead of the real one. This happens because the setuid root `openvpn_launcher` uses the attacker-controlled PATH when calling `networksetup`.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution as root.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Local access to the system.
    *   Ability to create and modify files.
    *   Ability to execute commands.
*   **Steps to Reproduce:**

    1.  Create a script named `networksetup` with malicious code (e.g., to output the current user ID).
    2.  Make the script executable.
    3.  Execute `run.sh` to open the PIA GUI client, but prepend the current working directory to the PATH environment variable.
    4.  Log in and connect to the VPN.
    5.  During the connection process, the malicious `networksetup` will be executed as root.
*   **Affected Version:** PIA VPN Client v82 for macOS.
*   **Fix:** Upgrade to v1.2.1+ of the new client.
