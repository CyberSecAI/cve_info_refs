**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI improperly sanitizing user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** Specifically, a low-privileged authenticated attacker can inject and execute arbitrary Cisco IOS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a low-privileged authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary Cisco IOS commands with elevated privileges (level 15) on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Web UI:** The attack vector is through the web-based user interface (Web UI) of the Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS XE Software when the HTTP Server feature is enabled.
*   The `ip http server` or `ip http secure-server` command being present in the configuration indicates that the HTTP server feature is enabled.
*   If `ip http active-session-modules none` and `ip http secure-active-session-modules none` are also present, the device is not vulnerable.
*   There are no workarounds other than disabling the HTTP Server feature, or limiting access to trusted networks
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS base score of 7.6 (High).
