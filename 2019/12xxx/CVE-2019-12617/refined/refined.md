Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12617:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrectly shared caches between files and page content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Permission cache pollution. CMS users could gain more access than defined due to the system incorrectly sharing caches between files and page content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Access escalation: CMS users with limited access to certain object types (e.g., read-only access to files) could gain higher access to those objects (e.g., edit access to files) if they have edit access to other, similarly identifiable, object types like pages.
- The vulnerability depends on a specific access sequence and the underlying records having similar characteristics (database identifier).

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation requires a CMS user with some level of access, but not necessarily high privileges.
- The user needs to access files or pages in a specific order, taking advantage of the cache pollution vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a valid CMS user account.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the access sequence and record characteristics required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be familiar with the CMS to exploit the vulnerability successfully by manipulating pages and files.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in Silverstripe CMS versions 4.3.5 and 4.4.4.
-  The CVSS score is 5.0
