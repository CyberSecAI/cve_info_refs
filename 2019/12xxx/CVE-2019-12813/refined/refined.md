The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12813.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The key used for obfuscating fingerprint images is transmitted in cleartext between the fingerprint scanner device and the driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CWE-319:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. The encryption key is transmitted without encryption.
*   **CWE-330:** Use of Insufficiently Random Values - the initialization vector used for generating the keystream is either static (in Windows) or predictable (in Linux).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who intercepts the communication between the fingerprint scanner and the driver can decrypt the fingerprint image. This allows the attacker to obtain the user's fingerprint data, which could be used for various malicious purposes, including identity theft or unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sniffing the communication channel between the fingerprint reader device and the driver. This can be done through a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on the communication between the fingerprint reader and the host computer. This could be a physical presence on the network or compromised network infrastructure.
