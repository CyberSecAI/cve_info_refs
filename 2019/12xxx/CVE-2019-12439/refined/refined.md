  "CVE-2019-12439": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability exists in `bubblewrap` where it misuses temporary directories in `/tmp` as a mount point. Specifically, if `/run/user/<UID>/.bubblewrap/` doesn't exist and can't be created, `bubblewrap` falls back to `/tmp/.bubblewrap-<UID>/`. A local attacker can exploit this by creating this directory in `/tmp` and making it a non-directory, non-symlink, or a symlink to a location under their control. This can cause a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution inside the container, if `protected_symlinks` is disabled.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of temporary directory creation and usage for mount points. `bubblewrap` falls back to using `/tmp` if `/run/user/<UID>/.bubblewrap/` cannot be created and does not validate the `/tmp` directory's integrity. ",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of `/tmp`",
      "Lack of proper validation of temporary mount points",
      "Reliance on user-controlled paths without sufficient protection"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can either cause a denial of service by preventing `bubblewrap` from creating its temporary mount, or potentially execute arbitrary code within a container. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or full system compromise, depending on the configurations and attacker capabilities.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attacker",
       "Abuse of temporary directory creation for mount points"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Local user access",
       "Ability to create files and directories in `/tmp` before `bubblewrap` is executed"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is contingent on the system not having `fs.protected_symlinks` enabled, which would otherwise prevent the symlink attack vector. The issue is mitigated by mounting the tmpfs directly on `/tmp` instead of a subdirectory, which is guaranteed to exist and is not controlled by the user. The vulnerability can be triggered if the `/run/user/<uid>/.bubblewrap` directory does not exist, is inaccessible, or cannot be created."
