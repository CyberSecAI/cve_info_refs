Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-12589 vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The seccomp filters used by Firejail were copied into `/run/firejail/mnt` and were writable within the jail. This allowed a malicious process inside the jail to modify the seccomp filters.

*   **Vulnerability:** Improper seccomp restrictions due to filters being writable inside the jail.

*   **Impact:** A malicious process could modify the seccomp filters to bypass the intended restrictions. Processes joined to the jail after the modification would not have the intended seccomp filters applied.

*   **Attack Vector:**

    1.  A user creates a firejail jail.
    2.  A malicious process modifies the seccomp filters inside the jail.
    3.  A new process joins the jail. This new process does not have the proper seccomp filters applied, thus bypassing the sandbox.

*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a malicious process running inside a firejail jail to modify the seccomp filters.

*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves mounting the runtime seccomp files as read-only.
