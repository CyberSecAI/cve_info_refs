Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12570:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The "Server Status by Hostname/IP" WordPress plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when editing server properties.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL injection. The plugin does not properly sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to potentially:
    *   Retrieve sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, configuration details).
    *   Modify data within the database.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the underlying system or other plugins by crafting malicious queries.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by a request to the WordPress admin panel page `admin.php`, specifically when the `page` parameter is set to `all-servers` and the `action` parameter is set to `edit`.
    * The vulnerable `id` parameter is located in the query string.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have access to the WordPress admin panel.
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable functionality.
    * The attacker needs to know the plugin and the vulnerable parameter, which can be found by reverse engineering the application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject a SQL query via the `id` parameter.
*   The example provided shows injecting `UNION SELECT 1,2,3,@@version` to retrieve the DBMS version, which can confirm successful injection. The `@@version` variable is specific to MySQL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from `fr-be.wordpress.org_bb824a48_20250121_021904.html` confirms that the plugin was closed on July 4, 2019, due to a security issue which is this SQL injection.
* The provided github content contains a basic exploit of the vulnerability in the form of a proof of concept.
