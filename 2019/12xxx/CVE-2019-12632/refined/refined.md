Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-12632

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because Cisco Finesse does not properly validate user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is an SSRF. Due to insufficient input validation, an attacker can manipulate requests to make the server send requests to unintended locations.
*   **Bypassed Access Controls:** The SSRF vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:**  The attacker could perform unauthorized actions on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and doesn't require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Crafted Requests:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a user of the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests to a user of the web application, usually by getting them to interact with malicious content.
*   No authentication or special access is required on the affected system to perform this attack.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco Finesse Software releases earlier than 11.6(1)ES7 or 12.0(1)ES01.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Cisco Finesse Software releases 11.6(1)ES7, 12.0(1)ES01, or later.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no workarounds to address the vulnerability, so upgrading the software is the only option.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory release.
