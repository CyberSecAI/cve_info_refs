```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data during CSV imports. Specifically, HTML code is not escaped when processing the CSV file.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- Impact of exploitation:
  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser by crafting a malicious CSV file. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user. In the provided example, the attacker is able to access document cookies and the personal salt key.

- Attack vectors:
  Importing a specially crafted CSV file via the "Import items" feature.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious CSV file and have the ability to import it into the TeamPass application.
