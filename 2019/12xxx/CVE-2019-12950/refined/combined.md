## Description

![@lebik](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15812611?u=2c6a4a4469195a5f758863b4834196b696b14c83&v=4&size=48)[lebik](https://github.com/lebik)opened [on Jun 25, 2019](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/issues/2638#issue-460455659)
### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a CSV file with the following data:

```

<img src=x onerror='alert(document.cookie+" "+document.getElementById("input_personal_saltkey").value);'>My_password.txt

```

2. From Teampass, go select "Import items" feature
3. On the CSV tab, select the file previously created.
4. Select the item with XSS payload to import

   That's all... we can tap to item and XSS payload will be executed.
