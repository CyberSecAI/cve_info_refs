Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding in the "classic" UI of Apache Airflow. This allows a malicious admin user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code by manipulating the state of objects stored in the Airflow metadata database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved within the application's database and executed when a user views specific pages.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize data from the metadata database before rendering it in the "classic" UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view affected pages.
- **Account Compromise:** The attacker could potentially steal user session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, and potentially escalate privileges within the application.
- **Data Manipulation or Theft:** The injected JavaScript could be used to manipulate data displayed in the UI or exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Manipulation:** A malicious administrator with write access to the Airflow metadata database can insert malicious payloads into the database objects' states.
- **Classic UI Access:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user navigates to a page using the vulnerable "classic" UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to be an administrative user of the Apache Airflow instance to be able to edit the metadata database content.
- **Knowledge of the Database:** The attacker must be aware of which database objects' state is rendered in the classic UI without proper sanitization.
- **Classic UI Enabled:** The affected Airflow instance needs to be configured to use the "classic" UI. The newer "RBAC" UI is not affected.

**Additional Information**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Apache Airflow version 1.10.5, released on 2019-09-04.
- The vulnerability only affects the "classic" UI and not the newer "RBAC" UI.
- The vulnerability was discovered by "Venkat"/yvreddy.
