  "CVE-2019-12708": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SPA100 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to unsafe handling of user credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing portions of the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access administrative credentials and potentially gain elevated privileges by reusing stolen credentials on the affected device.",
    "Root cause": "Unsafe handling of user credentials in the web-based management interface.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Credential Leakage"
    ],
    "Impact": "Access to administrative credentials, potentially leading to elevated privileges by reusing stolen credentials.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote, via the web-based management interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An authenticated attacker with access to the web interface.",
	"Additional Details": [
		"The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to /apply.cgi with a submit_button value of 'User_Level', which reveals the admin password hashes.",
		"The admin hash can then be used to log in as admin and escalate privileges."
