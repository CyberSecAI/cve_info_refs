Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12790:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read in the `r_egg_lang_parsechar` function within `egg_lang.c` of the radare2 framework.
*   The issue arises from a lack of boundary checking when incrementing `egg->lang.elem_n++` leading to a potential heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability.
*   Missing boundary checks during the parsing of a specific character within the egg language parser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to a crash due to a segmentation fault.
*   The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly stated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a specific input that triggers the parsing logic in the vulnerable `r_egg_lang_parsechar` function.
*   The vulnerable code is in the `ragg2` tool, a part of the radare2 framework. Specifically, using `ragg2` with crafted input could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a specific input (crafted file or arguments) to the `ragg2` tool.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the system where `ragg2` and the vulnerable version of radare2 are being used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in radare2 version 3.6.0.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Fedora updates for both Fedora 29 and Fedora 30.
*   The issue was identified and reported by mmmdzz on GitHub.
*   The fix involves adding boundary checks to prevent the heap buffer overflow.
