"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the FTP application layer gateway (ALG) functionality used by Network Address Translation (NAT), NAT IPv6 to IPv4 (NAT64), and the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow that occurs when an affected device inspects certain FTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a specific FTP transfer through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-ftp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-ftp\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 25, 2019, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 13 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2019 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72547\"]."

"text": "This vulnerability affects devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and they are configured with NAT, NAT64, or ZBFW with FTP inspection enabled.\r\n\r\nFor more information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be triggered by traffic that transits an affected device and is inspected by the ALG function. This vulnerability can also be triggered by traffic that is destined to an affected device if the ZBFW is configured to inspect FTP traffic for the self zone.\r\n Determine Whether NAT Is Configured\r\nTo assess whether a device is configured to perform NAT, administrators can determine whether NAT is active on the device (preferred) or whether NAT commands are present in the device configuration.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether NAT is active on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show ip nat statistics command in the CLI. If NAT is active, the Outside interfaces and Inside interfaces sections of the command output will include at least one interface.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show ip nat statistics command for a device on which NAT is active:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show ip nat statistics\r\n Total active translations: 0 (0 static, 0 dynamic; 0 extended) Peak translations: 10, occurred 00:24:01 ago Outside interfaces: FastEthernet0/0 Inside interfaces: FastEthernet0/1 Hits: 134280 Misses: 0 CEF Translated packets: 134270, CEF Punted packets: 10 Expired translations: 11 Dynamic mappings: -- Inside Source [Id: 1] access-list NET-192.168.20.0\_24 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0\_24 refcount 0 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0\_24: netmask 255.255.255.0 start 192.168.1.120 end 192.168.1.128 type generic, total addresses 9, allocated 0 (0%), misses 0 Total doors: 0 Appl doors: 0 Normal doors: 0 Queued Packets: 0 Router#\r\n\r\n If the output of the show ip nat statistics command does not list any interfaces, NAT is not active on the device.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, administrators can determine whether NAT is active on a device by issuing the show running-config command in the CLI and assessing whether NAT commands are present in the device configuration. If NAT is active on the device, the output of the show running-config command will include the ip nat inside and ip nat outside interface commands.\r\n Determine Whether the NAT ALG Function Is Enabled for FTP\r\nBy default, the NAT ALG function is enabled for FTP and the function does not appear in the running configuration information for a device.\r\n To determine whether a device is configured with NAT ALG for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include ip nat service ftp command in the CLI. If the command output shows the ip nat service ftp command with no preceding it, the NAT ALG is disabled for FTP. The following example demonstrates this condition:\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include ip nat service ftp\r\nno ip nat service ftp Router#\r\n\r\nIf there is no output for the show running-config | include ip nat service ftp command, the NAT ALG is enabled with FTP.\r\n Determine Whether NAT64 Is Configured\r\nTo assess whether a device is configured to perform NAT64, administrators can determine whether NAT64 is active on the device (preferred) or whether NAT64 commands are present in the device configuration.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether NAT64 is active on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show nat64 statistics command in the CLI. If NAT64 is active, the Interface Statistics sections of the command output will include at least one interface.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show nat64 statistics command for a device on which NAT64 is active:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show nat64 statistics\r\nNAT64 Statistics Total active translations: 2 (1 static, 1 dynamic; 1 extended) Sessions found: 155 Sessions created: 1 Expired translations: 0 Global Stats: Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6) Stateless: 0 Stateful: 81 MAP-T: 0 Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4) Stateless: 0 Stateful: 75 MAP-T: 0 Interface Statistics GigabitEthernet1 (IPv4 not configured, IPv6 configured): Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6) Stateless: 0 Stateful: 0 MAP-T: 0 Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4) Stateless: 0 Stateful: 75 MAP-T: 0 Packets dropped: 0 GigabitEthernet2 (IPv4 configured, IPv6 not configured): Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6) Stateless: 0 Stateful: 81 MAP-T: 0 Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4) Stateless: 0 Stateful: 0 MAP-T: 0 Packets dropped: 0 Dynamic Mapping Statistics v6v4 Limit Statistics\r\n\r\nIf the output of the show nat64 statistics command does not list any interfaces, NAT64 is not active on the device.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, administrators can determine whether NAT64 is active on a device by issuing the show running-config command in the CLI and assessing whether NAT64 commands are present in the device configuration. If NAT64 is active on the device, the output of the show running-config command will include the nat64 enable interface commands.\r\n Determine Whether the NAT64 ALG Function Is Enabled for FTP\r\nBy default, the NAT64 ALG function is enabled for FTP and the function does not appear in the running configuration information for a device.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured with NAT64 ALG for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include nat64 service ftp command in the CLI. If the command output shows the nat64 service ftp command with no preceding it, the NAT64 ALG is disabled for FTP. The following example demonstrates this condition:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include nat64 service ftp\r\n no nat64 service ftp Router#\r\n\r\nIf there is no output for the show running-config | include nat64 service ftp command, the NAT64 ALG is enabled with FTP.\r\n Determine Whether a Zone-Based Policy Firewall Is Configured\r\nTo assess whether a device is configured with a ZBFW, administrators can log in to the device and use the show zone security command in the CLI. If the command output shows a member interface under a zone name, the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that has ZBFW rules configured on both the GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1 member interfaces:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show zone security\r\nzone self\r\nDescription: System defined zone\r\n\r\nzone inside\r\nDescription: \*\*\* Inside Network \*\*\*\r\nMember Interfaces:\r\nGigabitEthernet0/0\r\n\r\nzone outside\r\nDescription: \*\*\* Outside Network \*\*\*\r\nMember Interfaces:\r\nGigabitEthernet0/1\r\n\r\nRouter#\r\n Determine Whether the ZBFW ALG Function Is Inspecting FTP\r\nBy default, the ZBFW ALG is disabled for FTP.\r\n\r\nIf the ZBFW ALG function has been configured with no protocol defined for the class being inspected, the ZBFW ALG function defaults to inspecting all protocols. A device with this configuration is vulnerable.\r\n\r\n The device is also vulnerable if the ZBFW ALG function is configured to inspect FTP, FTPS, or both. To determine the status of the ZBFW ALG function for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol ftp command in the CLI to determine whether FTP inspection has been explicitly configured. If the output returns a match on ftp or ftps, the device is vulnerable. The following example demonstrates this condition:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol ftp\r\n Match: protocol ftp Match: protocol ftps"

"category": "general",
"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "As a workaround, administrators can disable the FTP ALG function by using the following commands on an affected device until a software upgrade is performed:\r\n\r\nTo disable the use of NAT ALG for FTP, administrators can use the no ip nat service ftp command in global configuration mode.\r\nTo disable the use of NAT64 ALG for FTP, administrators can use the no nat64 service ftp command in global configuration mode.\r\nTo disable the use of FTP inspection in the ZBFW, remove the commands match protocol ftp and match protocol ftps from the inspection class map.\r\n\r\nNote: Disable the FTP ALG function only if it is not required in the environment. Disabling FTP ALG will prevent FTP transactions through the device from working properly."

"title": "Fixed Software",
"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S—in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the Impact Rating drop-down list.\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21\_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios\_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_rel\_notes/asr1k\_rn\_3s\_sys\_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL\_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release."

The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow that occurs when an affected device inspects certain FTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a specific FTP transfer through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  This advisory is part of the September 25, 2019, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 13 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2019 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72547).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and they are configured with NAT, NAT64, or ZBFW with FTP inspection enabled.  For more information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Note:** This vulnerability can be triggered by traffic that transits an affected device and is inspected by the ALG function. This vulnerability can also be triggered by traffic that is destined to an affected device if the ZBFW is configured to inspect FTP traffic for the self zone. Determine Whether NAT Is Configured To assess whether a device is configured to perform NAT, administrators can determine whether NAT is active on the device (preferred) or whether NAT commands are present in the device configuration.  To determine whether NAT is active on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show ip nat statistics** command in the CLI. If NAT is active, the *Outside interfaces* and *Inside interfaces* sections of the command output will include at least one interface.  The following example shows the output of the **show ip nat statistics** command for a device on which NAT is active:  ```   Router#show ip nat statistics      Total active translations: 0 (0 static, 0 dynamic; 0 extended)   Peak translations: 10, occurred 00:24:01 ago   Outside interfaces:     FastEthernet0/0   Inside interfaces:      FastEthernet0/1   Hits: 134280  Misses: 0   CEF Translated packets: 134270, CEF Punted packets: 10   Expired translations: 11   Dynamic mappings:   -- Inside Source   [Id: 1] access-list NET-192.168.20.0_24 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24 refcount 0    pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24: netmask 255.255.255.0   start 192.168.1.120 end 192.168.1.128   type generic, total addresses 9, allocated 0 (0%), misses 0      Total doors: 0   Appl doors: 0   Normal doors: 0   Queued Packets: 0   Router#   ```  If the output of the **show ip nat statistics** command does not list any interfaces, NAT is not active on the device.  Alternatively, administrators can determine whether NAT is active on a device by issuing the **show running-config** command in the CLI and assessing whether NAT commands are present in the device configuration. If NAT is active on the device, the output of the **show running-config** command will include the **ip nat inside** and **ip nat outside** interface commands. Determine Whether the NAT ALG Function Is Enabled for FTP By default, the NAT ALG function is enabled for FTP and the function does not appear in the running configuration information for a device. To determine whether a device is configured with NAT ALG for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show running-config | include ip nat service ftp** command in the CLI. If the command output shows the **ip nat service ftp** command with **no** preceding it, the NAT ALG is disabled for FTP. The following example demonstrates this condition: ```   Router#show running-config | include ip nat service ftp   no ip nat service ftp   Router#      ```  If there is no output for the **show running-config | include ip nat service ftp** command, the NAT ALG is enabled with FTP. Determine Whether NAT64 Is Configured To assess whether a device is configured to perform NAT64, administrators can determine whether NAT64 is active on the device (preferred) or whether NAT64 commands are present in the device configuration.  To determine whether NAT64 is active on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show nat64 statistics** command in the CLI. If NAT64 is active, the *Interface Statistics* sections of the command output will include at least one interface.  The following example shows the output of the **show nat64 statistics** command for a device on which NAT64 is active:  ```   Router#show nat64 statistics   NAT64 Statistics      Total active translations: 2 (1 static, 1 dynamic; 1 extended)   Sessions found: 155   Sessions created: 1   Expired translations: 0   Global Stats:      Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6)         Stateless: 0         Stateful: 81         MAP-T: 0      Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4)         Stateless: 0         Stateful: 75         MAP-T: 0      Interface Statistics      GigabitEthernet1 (IPv4 not configured, IPv6 configured):         Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6)            Stateless: 0            Stateful: 0            MAP-T: 0         Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4)            Stateless: 0            Stateful: 75            MAP-T: 0         Packets dropped: 0      GigabitEthernet2 (IPv4 configured, IPv6 not configured):         Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6)            Stateless: 0            Stateful: 81            MAP-T: 0         Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4)            Stateless: 0            Stateful: 0            MAP-T: 0         Packets dropped: 0   Dynamic Mapping Statistics      v6v4   Limit Statistics   ```  If the output of the **show nat64 statistics** command does not list any interfaces, NAT64 is not active on the device.  Alternatively, administrators can determine whether NAT64 is active on a device by issuing the **show running-config** command in the CLI and assessing whether NAT64 commands are present in the device configuration. If NAT64 is active on the device, the output of the **show running-config** command will include the **nat64 enable** interface commands. Determine Whether the NAT64 ALG Function Is Enabled for FTP By default, the NAT64 ALG function is enabled for FTP and the function does not appear in the running configuration information for a device.  To determine whether a device is configured with NAT64 ALG for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show running-config | include nat64 service ftp** command in the CLI. If the command output shows the **nat64 service ftp** command with **no** preceding it, the NAT64 ALG is disabled for FTP. The following example demonstrates this condition:  ```   Router#show running-config | include nat64 service ftp      no nat64 service ftp   Router#   ```  If there is no output for the **show running-config | include nat64 service ftp** command, the NAT64 ALG is enabled with FTP. Determine Whether a Zone-Based Policy Firewall Is Configured To assess whether a device is configured with a ZBFW, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show zone security** command in the CLI. If the command output shows a member interface under a zone name, the device is vulnerable.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has ZBFW rules configured on both the GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1 member interfaces:  ```   Router#show zone securityzone self  Description: System defined zonezone inside  Description: *** Inside Network ***  Member Interfaces:    GigabitEthernet0/0zone outside  Description: *** Outside Network ***  Member Interfaces:    GigabitEthernet0/1Router#   ``` Determine Whether the ZBFW ALG Function Is Inspecting FTP By default, the ZBFW ALG is disabled for FTP.  If the ZBFW ALG function has been configured with no protocol defined   for the class being inspected, the ZBFW ALG function defaults to   inspecting all protocols. A device with this configuration is   vulnerable.  The device is also vulnerable if the ZBFW ALG function is configured to inspect FTP, FTPS, or both. To determine the status of the ZBFW ALG function for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol ftp** command in the CLI to determine whether FTP inspection has been explicitly configured. If the output returns a match on *ftp* or *ftps*, the device is vulnerable. The following example demonstrates this condition:  ```   Router#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol ftp           Match: protocol ftp           Match: protocol ftps    ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Workarounds  * As a workaround, administrators can disable the FTP ALG function by using the following commands on an affected device until a software upgrade is performed:    + To disable the use of NAT ALG for FTP, administrators can use the **no ip nat service ftp** command in global configuration mode.   + To disable the use of NAT64 ALG for FTP, administrators can use the **no nat64 service ftp** command in global configuration mode.   + To disable the use of FTP inspection in the ZBFW, remove the commands **match protocol ftp** and **match protocol ftps** from the inspection class map. **Note:** Disable the FTP ALG function only if it is not required in the environment. Disabling FTP ALG will prevent FTP transactions through the device from working properly.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**-in the following field:       By default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the **Impact Rating** drop-down list.     For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
