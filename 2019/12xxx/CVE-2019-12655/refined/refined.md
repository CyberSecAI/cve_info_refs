## CVE-2019-12655

The content provided describes a vulnerability in the FTP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) functionality within Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Root Cause:** A buffer overflow occurs when an affected Cisco device inspects certain FTP traffic.

**Vulnerability:**
- Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the FTP ALG functionality.

**Attack Vector:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by performing a specific FTP transfer through the affected device.

**Impact:**
- A successful exploit could cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Affected Products:**
- This vulnerability affects devices running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and configured with NAT, NAT64, or ZBFW with FTP inspection enabled.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by traffic transiting the device and inspected by the ALG function, or by traffic destined to the device if ZBFW is configured to inspect FTP traffic for the self zone.

**Required Capabilities:**
- The attacker needs the ability to perform FTP transfers through the affected device.
- No authentication is required.

**Workarounds:**
- Disable the FTP ALG function using the following commands:
  - `no ip nat service ftp` (global configuration mode) to disable NAT ALG for FTP.
  - `no nat64 service ftp` (global configuration mode) to disable NAT64 ALG for FTP.
  - Remove `match protocol ftp` and `match protocol ftps` commands from the inspection class map to disable FTP inspection in ZBFW.

**Fixed Software:**
Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
