The 2FA is applied to both, frontend and backend.  ---    Installation Just upload all files into your forum and activate it in the ACP.

The issue seems to be missing table closing tags. And there is an closing form tag even when no need for it.  I'm using it and it all looks nice, it may be better that the other solution I was using (Auth2My). Cheers.
