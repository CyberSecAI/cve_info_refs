{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Inateck WP2002 wireless presenter uses unencrypted and unauthenticated 2.4 GHz radio communication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)",
      "Unencrypted data communication",
      "Unauthenticated data communication"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary keystrokes into a victim's computer system, potentially leading to malware installation and remote control of the victim's computer.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Analyzing unencrypted and unauthenticated 2.4 GHz radio communication packets.",
      "Injecting malicious packets into the data stream which are interpreted as keystrokes by the receiver (USB dongle)."
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be within range of the 2.4 GHz wireless communication to intercept and inject packets. The attacker needs to be able to analyze the radio communication and inject modified packets using tools such as Universal Radio Hacker and a software defined radio like HackRF One."
