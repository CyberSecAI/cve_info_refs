Advisory ID: SYSS-2019-008
Product: 2.4 GHz Wearable Wireless Presenter WP2002
Manufacturer: Inateck
Affected Version(s): n/a
Tested Version(s): n/a
Vulnerability Type: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)
                    Keystroke Injection Vulnerability
Risk Level: High
Solution Status: Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2019-03-22
Solution Date: -
Public Disclosure: 2019-06-04
CVE Reference: CVE-2019-12504
Author of Advisory: Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Inateck WP2002 is a ring-shaped wearable wireless presenter using
2.4 GHz radio communication.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"
* Easy to Use: Uses 2.4 GHz USB wireless connection, with receiving
  distance reaching 20 meters. You’re free to move in a large space
  when wearing it on fingers. No driver needed, just plug and play!
* Ring-shaped design. You can wear it on your fingers (the ring is
  adjustable). Free your hands and have more body language, which will
  let your speech become more attractive.
* Multi-functional: By controlling the three function keys in control
  key area, you can turn pages, open full screen, close the screen, and
  access a hyperlink.
* Prolonged working use. Full charge allows a continuous working time
  of 15 days. Battery life is powerful, which greatly facilitates
  frequent use.
* Fits Powerpoint, Keynote(except hyperlink and windows switch
  functions), and supports page turning function with Google Slides and
  Prezi. Compatible with Windows XP/7/8/8.1/10, Mac OS, Linux, Android
  and etc.
"

Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless
presenter Inateck WP2002 is prone to keystroke injection attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the wireless presenter Inateck WP2002 is
vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted and unauthenticated data
packets of the 2.4 GHz radio communication sent by the wireless
presenter to the receiver (USB dongle) in order to learn the used
protocol. By knowing the used data protocol, it is possible to inject
packets in the data communication that are actually interpreted as
keystrokes by the receiver on the target system.

Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's
computer system, for example in order to install malware when the target
system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control
over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of
an Inateck WP2002 wireless presenter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH could successfully perform keystroke injection attacks against
the wireless presenter Inateck WP2002 using the open-source software
tool Universal Radio Hacker [2] in combination with the software-defined
radio HackRF One [3].

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for this reported security
vulnerability.

LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.
