The provided content is related to CVE-2019-12207.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `nxt_utf8_decode` function within `nxt/nxt_utf8.c` at line 72.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in the `nxt_utf8_decode` function. This function is used for UTF-8 decoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited further. The provided stack trace shows a crash due to the read out of bounds.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific input for a javascript regular expression. The provided testcase demonstrates this using base64 encoded payload. The crafted regex input leads to the overflow in the utf8 decoder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted string which is parsed using njs regular expression functions. This likely means the attacker must be able to pass input through the njs engine, likely through a web server using the njs module.
