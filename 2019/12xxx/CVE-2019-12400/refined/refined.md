      "root_cause": "A caching mechanism was introduced in Apache Santuario XML Security for Java version 2.0.3 to speed up the creation of new XML documents using a static pool of DocumentBuilders. However, if untrusted code can register a malicious implementation with the thread context class loader first, this implementation might be cached and reused by Apache Santuario, leading to potential security flaws.",

        "Improper handling of untrusted code loading into the classloader."

        "The vulnerability can be exploited if untrusted code can register a malicious implementation with the thread context class loader, which would then be cached and used by Apache Santuario."
