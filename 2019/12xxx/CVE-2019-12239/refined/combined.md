## Installation

1. Install the plugin by uploading the zip file (Plugins > Add New > Upload)
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Click on the ‘WP Booking System’ menu entry
4. Click on ‘Add New’ at the top of the page to create a calendar
5. To embed a calendar on a page or post, use the ‘Add Calendar’ button at that page

## FAQ

### How can I embed the booking calendar on a page or post?

By using the ‘Add Calendar’ button above the editor, the Gutenberg module, a widget, or directly by using the shortcode. An example of the shortcode is:

```
[wpbs id="1" title="yes/no" legend="yes/no" language="auto" form_id="1"]

```

### Will this booking system work for me?

We’re pretty sure about that! We made this plugin as ‘flexible’ as possible. The booking plugin works with bookings on a per day basis (no time slots). So if you rent something out on a daily basis, then the WP Booking System is a good choice.

## Installation

1. Install the plugin by uploading the zip file (Plugins > Add New > Upload)
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Click on the ‘WP Booking System’ menu entry
4. Click on ‘Add New’ at the top of the page to create a calendar
5. To embed a calendar on a page or post, use the ‘Add Calendar’ button at that page

## FAQ

### How can I embed the booking calendar on a page or post?

By using the ‘Add Calendar’ button above the editor, the Gutenberg module, a widget, or directly by using the shortcode. An example of the shortcode is:

```
[wpbs id="1" title="yes/no" legend="yes/no" language="auto" form_id="1"]

```

### Will this booking system work for me?

We’re pretty sure about that! We made this plugin as ‘flexible’ as possible. The booking plugin works with bookings on a per day basis (no time slots). So if you rent something out on a daily basis, then the WP Booking System is a good choice.

CSRF & Authed SQLi in 'wp-booking-system' WordPress plugin
==========================================================
CVE-2019-12239
Two authenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in
wp-booking-system v1.5.1.[1]. At the time of writing this, wordpress.org
reports 9000+ active installations. Prepared statements are used correctly
in a lot of places, however unfortunately two queries were missed.
Due to the required authentication in order to reach the vulnerable code,
the complexity of exploitation is the same as the complexity involved in
gaining access to an administrative user session. Luckily for the
attacker, no CSRF protective mechanisms (WordPress nonce[2]) were found.
It is therefore possible for an attacker to craft a malicious webpage that
once visited by an authenticated administrative user, will trigger the
SQL injection vulnerability.
# Bug1 details
