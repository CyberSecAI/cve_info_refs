Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12239:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of two SQL injection vulnerabilities due to unsanitized user input in two different areas of the plugin's code, specifically within SQL queries:
    *   `bookingModalData_callback` function in `include/bookingAjax.php`
    *  `booking-delete.php` controller within the `wpbs_calendars` function in `include/pluginStructure.php`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin directly concatenates user-supplied input (`$_POST['calendarID']` and `$_GET['bookingID']`) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Missing CSRF Protection:** The plugin lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. This means an attacker can trick an authenticated administrator into unknowingly executing actions within the vulnerable plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Manipulation:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive information from the database.
    *   Modify or delete existing data.
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the WordPress database and the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when visited by an authenticated WordPress administrator, sends a request to the vulnerable plugin, executing arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Direct Exploitation:** An attacker with direct access to the vulnerable endpoints (e.g. via a vulnerable admin panel) can inject malicious SQL payloads through the `calendarID` and `bookingID` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious page or perform actions via the admin panel
*   The attacker needs to induce an authenticated administrative user to visit the malicious page for a CSRF based attack.
*   The attacker needs to have some means of sending requests to the vulnerable endpoints directly for a direct SQL injection attack.
