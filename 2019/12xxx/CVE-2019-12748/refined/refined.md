- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `t3://` URL handling in TYPO3 CMS is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This occurs when the `javascript:` or `data:` schemes are used within link fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Input sanitization is not properly performed on the URL when using the `t3://` scheme.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they access a page containing the manipulated link, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  An attacker could inject malicious URLs (e.g., `t3://url/?url=javascript:alert(1);`) into link fields within the TYPO3 backend or in frontend extensions that utilize typolink.
    - The vulnerability can be exploited through both the backend and frontend of TYPO3 installations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs the ability to insert the malicious link into a TYPO3 link field, either in the backend or via a frontend form. The attacker also needs to trick a victim into clicking the link.
