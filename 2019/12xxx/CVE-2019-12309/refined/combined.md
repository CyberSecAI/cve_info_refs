### [Issues](/security/known-issues.dot) » File Upload Vulnerability

| Issue: | SI-48 |
| --- | --- |
| Date: | Jan 10, 2019, 4:15:00 AM |
| Severity: | Medium |
| Requires Admin Access: | Yes |
| Fix Version: | TBD |
| Credit: | Johannes Moritz - RIPS TECHNOLOGIES GMBH |
| Description: | A specific dotCMS REST endpoint can be utilized to create files on the server's filesystem.  To exploit this vulnerability, the user must be logged into the backend of dotCMS with administrator permissions.  Status of this issue can be tracked here:  <https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/15812> |
| Mitigation: | Should always be running dotCMS as a user that only has access to the parts of the filesystem necessary to run dotCMS.  These limited permissions will keep this vulnerability from being used to create files outside of the dotCMS / tomcat directory structure. <https://dotcms.com/docs/latest/security-best-practices#ServerPermissions>    Also, use OSGi plugin to restrict access to vulnerable URLs:  <https://github.com/dotCMS/com.dotcms.csrffilter> |
