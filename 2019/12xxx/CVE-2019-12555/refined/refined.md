Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12555:

## CVE-2019-12555

### Summary
The provided content relates to a buffer overflow vulnerability in 010 Editor, triggered by the `SubStr` function.

### Root Cause
The vulnerability stems from improper bounds checking in the `SubStr` function within 010 Editor. When called with a large size argument, it leads to a buffer overflow.

### Vulnerabilities
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `SubStr` function attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer.

### Attack Vectors
- By crafting a malformed Binary Template (.bt) file that calls `SubStr` with specifically chosen parameters.

### Impact
- **Crash:** Overwriting memory can lead to program termination.

### Exploit Details
The provided `.bt` file demonstrates a possible exploit:

```c
// CVE-2019-12555
local char a[0x100];
Memset(a, 'A', sizeof(a));
SubStr(a, 0x99, 0x7fffffff);
```

1.  A local character array `a` of size 0x100 (256) bytes is declared.
2.  The array is filled with the character 'A' using `Memset`.
3.  The `SubStr` function is called with the following arguments:
    *   `a`: The character array.
    *   `0x99`:  The starting index (153).
    *   `0x7fffffff`: A very large size (maximum positive 32-bit integer). This causes `SubStr` to attempt to copy a substring that exceeds the boundaries of array `a`, resulting in a buffer overflow.

### Required Capabilities
Attacker would need to:
1.  Craft a malicious `.bt` file.
2.  Get a user to open this file within a vulnerable version of 010 Editor.
