Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the `Special:EditTags` page of MediaWiki. Specifically, the page exposes suppressed usernames or log entries due to hardcoded usernames in links, and by manipulating the `logid` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** Suppressed usernames and log entries, intended to be hidden, are revealed. This occurs in two main scenarios:
    *   **Hardcoded usernames in links:** When accessing the logs related to a suppressed user, the username is hardcoded into the generated links.
    *   **Direct `logid` manipulation:** By manually setting the `logid` parameter in the URL of the `Special:EditTags` page, it's possible to view suppressed log entries that would otherwise be restricted.

2.  **Insufficient Access Control:** The `Special:EditTags` page fails to properly check if the current user has the necessary permissions to view suppressed information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers can gain access to suppressed user information, potentially revealing sensitive data about deleted content or banned users.
*   **Circumvention of Moderation:** The ability to view suppressed log entries could reveal details about moderation actions that were meant to be private.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Accessing `Special:EditTags` through a log entry link:**  A regular user can navigate to Special:Log, select an entry, and click "Edit tags of selected log entries".  If the log entry is suppressed, the username is revealed in a link.
2.  **Direct URL manipulation:** By modifying the `logid` parameter in the `Special:EditTags` URL, a user can directly access log entries even if they should be restricted.
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the MediaWiki instance.
*   No specific privileges are required to exploit the hardcoded username issue (Case 1).
*   No specific privileges are required to exploit the logid manipulation issue (Case 2).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a permission check to ensure that users are authorized to view the type of log entry being accessed.
*   The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of MediaWiki (1.27, 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, and master), and the fix has been backported to relevant branches.
*   The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was fixed by adding permission checks on the relevant pages.
