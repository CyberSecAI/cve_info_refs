Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12527:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies within the `HttpHeader::getAuth` function in Squid. This function is responsible for handling Basic Authentication, where user credentials are base64 encoded and sent in the `Proxy-Authorization` header. When decoding the base64 encoded credentials, Squid uses a global buffer to store the decoded data, but it fails to check whether the decoded length will exceed the capacity of this buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. Due to the missing bounds check, attacker-controlled input can cause the `memcpy` operation in the decoding process to write past the end of the allocated buffer in the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not directly stated in all sources, the primary impact of a heap-based buffer overflow is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By carefully crafting the input, an attacker could overwrite parts of the heap, allowing them to potentially hijack the control flow of the application and execute malicious code.
*   **Denial of Service:** The buffer overflow could also cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Confidentiality and Integrity Violation**: Although not explicitly mentioned in most sources, it can be assumed that the overflow could corrupt other memory regions, and could cause data corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, exploiting the way Squid handles Basic Authentication.
*   **Proxy-Authorization Header:** The vulnerability is triggered when a client sends a malicious `Proxy-Authorization` header during an authentication attempt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need the ability to send a request to a vulnerable Squid server that uses basic authentication with a `Proxy-Authorization` header.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the header, and can be triggered by unauthenticated user.
*   **Control Over User Credentials:** The attacker needs to control the content of the user credentials in order to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Notes**

* The SUSE advisory notes that this vulnerability has a *critical* severity.
* Red Hat indicates that a `mitigation` would include denying `ftp://` protocol URLs and denying Cache Manager reports access to all clients.

In summary, the CVE-2019-12527 describes a heap-based buffer overflow in Squid's Basic Authentication handling. By sending a carefully crafted `Proxy-Authorization` header, an attacker can cause Squid to overwrite portions of the heap which could lead to code execution or denial-of-service.
