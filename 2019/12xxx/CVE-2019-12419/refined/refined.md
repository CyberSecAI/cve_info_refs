  "vulnerability": {
    "id": "CVE-2019-12419",
    "description": "Apache CXF provides all of the components that are required to build a fully fledged OpenId Connect service. There is a vulnerability in the access token services, where it does not validate that the authenticated principal is equal to that of the supplied clientId parameter in the request. If a malicious client was able to somehow steal an authorization code issued to another client, then they could exploit this vulnerability to obtain an access token for the other client.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "All versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.3.4 and 3.2.11"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The access token service does not validate that the authenticated principal is equal to that of the supplied clientId parameter in the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Insecure Authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious client, having stolen an authorization code for another client, could obtain an access token for the legitimate client.",
