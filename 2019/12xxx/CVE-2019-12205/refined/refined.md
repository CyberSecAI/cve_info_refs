{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of a vulnerable SWF file within a third-party library packaged with silverstripe/framework (3.x) and silverstripe/admin (4.x). This SWF file was accessible by default on SilverStripe websites.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected XSS vulnerability present in a bundled SWF file.",
      "Direct execution of SWF files in older browsers, potentially exposing document objects and associated data.",
	  "The vulnerable SWF was accessible on SilverStripe websites by default"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a reflected XSS attack, potentially allowing an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser. This can expose sensitive data like cookies.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a vulnerable page in an older browser that executes SWF files directly.",
      "The SWF file is accessible by default on affected websites."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious URL with a vulnerable browser (mostly older browsers with flash support)."
