- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `RequestLoggerMiddleware.cs` in IdentityServer4 does not sanitize the `HttpContext` before logging it. Specifically, the `request.Headers`, `request.Host`, `request.Protocol` and `request.Form` data is logged without proper encoding, allowing for the injection of XSS payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The code logs raw request data without sanitization, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts into the request headers, host, protocol, or form data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the logs by crafting a specific HTTP request containing the XSS payload. When the logs are viewed (presumably by an administrator), the injected script will be executed in the context of the log viewer, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server with malicious JavaScript code injected into request headers, the host, the protocol, or form data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the IdentityServer4 instance.
