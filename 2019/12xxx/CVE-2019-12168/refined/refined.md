- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web application of the Four Faith industrial routers includes a "smart" command shell that allows users to execute system commands. This shell lacks proper input sanitization, allowing for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability exists in the command execution shell accessible through the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router, leading to a reverse shell, full system compromise, and potentially allowing pivoting to other devices in the OT network.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the web interface of the router, specifically through the command execution shell in the diagnostics section, accessible after logging in.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the router, have valid credentials to login to the web interface (default admin/admin) and then access the diagnostics command shell.
