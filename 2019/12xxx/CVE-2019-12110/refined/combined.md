```
Ben Barnea and colleagues from VDOO discovered several vulnerabilities in
miniupnpd, a small daemon that provides UPnP Internet Gateway Device and
Port Mapping Protocol services.
The issues are basically information leak, null pointer dereferences and
uses after free.
```

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.20140523-4+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your miniupnpd packages.

# USN-4542-1: MiniUPnPd vulnerabilities

25 September 2020

Several security issues were fixed in MiniUPnPd.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [miniupnpd](/security/cves?package=miniupnpd) - UPnP and NAT-PMP daemon for gateway routers

## Details

It was discovered that MiniUPnPd did not properly validate callback

addresses. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to expose

sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-12107](/security/CVE-2019-12107))

It was discovered that MiniUPnPd incorrectly handled unpopulated user XML

input. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause MiniUPnPd to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-12108](/security/CVE-2019-12108), [CVE-2019-12109](/security/CVE-2019-12109))

It was discovered that MiniUPnPd incorrectly handled an empty description

when port mapping. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

MiniUPnPd to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-12110](/security/CVE-2019-12110))

It was discovered that MiniUPnPd did not properly parse certain PCP

requests. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause MiniUPnPd to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-12111](/security/CVE-2019-12111))
