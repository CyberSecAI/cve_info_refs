- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A local file path traversal vulnerability exists in MacDown that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary programs by crafting a specific URI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local file path traversal, improper handling of URI schemes, arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary programs on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URI using the `file:///` argument or directory traversal (`../../../../something.app`) within a note.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify notes containing the malicious URI and share it with the victim, who needs to open the crafted note with the vulnerable version of MacDown.
