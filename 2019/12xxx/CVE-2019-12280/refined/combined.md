**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

##### PC-Doctor Responds to Software Vulnerability Report

PC-Doctor, Inc., the global leader in PC and Android system health, was recently made aware of a potential security vulnerability as reported by SafeBreach. PC-Doctor takes software security seriously and has already released updates to affected customers to address the issue.

---

RENO, Nevada (June 20, 2019) — PC-Doctor recently became aware of a security vulnerability in some of our Windows end-user product offerings. The issue was quickly resolved and updates were delivered to affected customers. In our opinion, it would be very rare for one to have both permissions and the ability to exploit this vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an administrative user or process would have to change the system’s PATH environment variable to include a folder writable by non-admin users, and craft a DLL that exploits PC-Doctor’s administrative privileges. It is not possible to exploit this vulnerability without modifying default Windows settings.

The vulnerability was reported against PC-Doctor’s Dell Hardware Support Service, which is included with Dell’s SupportAssist, but also affects PC-Doctor Toolbox for Windows. Both products are installed on systems to monitor for hardware issues and can be run on-demand. Urgent fixes were initially made available between 5/28/2019 and 6/17/2019. PC-Doctor Toolbox for Windows is also rebranded for other OEMs. The affected customers had updates released, and almost all of the affected users have been automatically upgraded. PC-Doctor strongly recommends that users opt-in for automatic software updates or manually check for available updates from within their product.

PC-Doctor understands the importance of security and will continue to work with all parties to ensure a safe computing environment for its many customers.
