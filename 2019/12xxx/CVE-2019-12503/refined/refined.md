  "CVE-2019-12503": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insecure implementation of the data communication protocol used by the wireless barcode scanner.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unencrypted 2.4 GHz radio communication between the barcode scanner and its USB dongle.",
        "Unauthenticated data packets in the 2.4 GHz radio communication."
      ],
      "impact": "Keystroke injection attacks, allowing an attacker to send arbitrary keystrokes or keystroke sequences to the target system via the USB dongle.",
      "attack_vectors": "Analyzing the unencrypted and unauthenticated 2.4 GHz radio communication between the wireless barcode scanner and its USB receiver to learn the used data protocol, then sending crafted packets to inject keystrokes.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be within radio range of the wireless barcode scanner and have the capability to analyze and transmit 2.4 GHz radio signals. Tools like Crazyradio PA and nrf-research-firmware can be used for this purpose."
