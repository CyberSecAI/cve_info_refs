    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2019-12992",
      "description": "The \"create\" action in UsersController is susceptible to command injection by a remote, authenticated attacker. Specifically, the create function does not sufficiently validate or sanitize HTTP request parameter values that are used to construct a shell command. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by supplying a crafted value for 'level'. Note: when $level is compared to an integer value (using ==), it is converted to 0 (int). This is why validation passes. Type checking would help here (===).",
      "affected_products": [
        "Citrix SD-WAN 10.2.x before 10.2.3",
        "NetScaler SD-WAN 10.0.x before 10.0.8"
      ],
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation and sanitization of the 'level' parameter in the UsersController's 'create' action, which leads to command injection.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Improper Input Validation"
       ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary command execution with the privileges of the web server user, which can be escalated to root because the www-data user has been given 'sudo' privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the /Users/create endpoint with a malicious 'level' parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated attacker with the ability to send HTTP requests to the affected endpoint."
