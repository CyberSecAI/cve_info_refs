{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The MOBOTIX S14 Camera does not implement any mechanism to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of CSRF protection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to a complete device takeover, including changing local account passwords without the authenticated user's knowledge and adding new administrative users.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious web page with a form that, when submitted by an authenticated user, will send a forged request to the camera. This could happen through the user's browser being tricked into submitting the crafted form while the user is logged into the camera's management interface.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a logged-in user of the MOBOTIX S14 camera to visit a malicious webpage. The attacker doesn't need to know the user's login credentials, as the vulnerability exploits the existing authenticated session."
