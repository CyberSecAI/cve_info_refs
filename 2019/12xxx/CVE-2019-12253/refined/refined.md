The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12253.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting postings in the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing CSRF token in delete posting requests.
- Delete requests can be triggered via both GET and POST methods without CSRF validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in admin user into deleting postings without their consent. This can be achieved by enticing the victim to click a crafted link or visit a malicious site, which triggers the deletion request.
- The attacker can delete any post the admin has permission to delete.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can send a victim a crafted URL or embed such a URL on a website.
- If the victim is logged into the application, accessing this URL or submitting a malicious form can result in the deletion of the targeted post.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or HTML form that targets the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrative user into accessing the malicious link or submitting the crafted form.
