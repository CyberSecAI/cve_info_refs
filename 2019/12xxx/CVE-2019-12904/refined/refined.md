Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12904:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content, particularly from the SUSE Bugzilla entry, the SUSE CVE page, and the GnuPG development hub, confirms that this content is related to CVE-2019-12904. The core issue is a side-channel vulnerability in the C implementation of AES in libgcrypt.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The C implementation of AES in `libgcrypt` used lookup tables for performance.
- These lookup tables were stored in the `.rodata` section of the ELF file.
- When multiple processes mapped the same library, they received different virtual addresses but shared the same physical address for these tables.
- This shared physical address space allowed other processes to potentially evict the cached AES tables and perform a flush and reload attack, recovering information about the AES operation.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Side-Channel Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a type of side-channel attack, specifically a cache-based attack, where an attacker can observe the system's behavior (cache usage) to extract cryptographic keys or other secret data.
- **Shared Physical Memory:** The root cause is the shared physical memory for read-only data between processes, specifically for AES lookup tables.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can potentially recover parts or all of the secret key used by the AES encryption algorithm.
- **Compromise of Confidentiality:** If the AES key is recovered, the confidentiality of encrypted data is compromised.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Flush and Reload Attack:** An attacker process needs to be running on the same system as a victim process using the vulnerable libgcrypt implementation of AES. The attacker process can manipulate the shared cache by evicting the lookup tables and observing the memory access time when the victim process uses those tables for AES operations.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the same machine as the victim process.
- **Knowledge of Shared Memory:** The attacker needs to be able to understand how shared libraries are mapped in memory and the implications for shared caches.
- **Timing Capabilities:** The attacker needs the capability to measure timing differences in memory access to identify cache hits and misses.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Vendor Dispute:**  The CVE description notes that "the vendor's position is that the issue report cannot be validated because there is no description of an attack." However, the fixes implemented (moving tables to `.data`, adding prefetch counters) and the various security advisories suggest that the issue was indeed taken seriously by maintainers despite the lack of a full PoC.
- **Mitigation:** The fix for this vulnerability includes the following:
   - Moving the AES lookup tables from the `.rodata` section to the `.data` section. This forces a copy-on-write behavior in the kernel, so each process using `libgcrypt` will get its own private copy of the lookup table.
    -  Adding counters before and after the look-up table to ensure copy-on-write happens and prevent same page merging by the kernel.
- **Affected Platforms**: The C implementation of AES is used on platforms where an assembly-language implementation is unavailable. While initially discovered with PowerPC in mind, this is not platform specific and can affect any platform that relies on the C implementation of AES.
- **libgcrypt Versions:** `libgcrypt` versions prior to 1.8.4 are reported as not vulnerable.

In summary, CVE-2019-12904 is a significant side-channel vulnerability that stems from shared physical memory of lookup tables used in the C implementation of AES within libgcrypt. The fix involves ensuring that these tables are not shared between processes and reside in private memory.
