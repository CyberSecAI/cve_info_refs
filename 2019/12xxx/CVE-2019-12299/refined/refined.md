Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-12299

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the inadequate handling of user-supplied input within the "name" field of the "Category" section in Sandline Centraleyezer (On Premises). Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize HTML entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means that malicious scripts injected into the vulnerable field are stored on the server and executed when other users interact with the affected data.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or encode HTML entities, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
*  **Bypass of Restrictions:** The attacker was able to bypass the application's input restrictions by using HTML entities `&gt;` (>) and `&lt;` (<).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Potential for Account Compromise:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of a user, leading to account compromise.
*  **Defacement/Malware Distribution**: The attacker could potentially deface the website or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the application's web interface.
*   **Category Name Field:** The specific attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the "name" field when creating or editing a category.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a authenticated user with the ability to create or edit categories.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker requires a web browser to interact with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes**
* The XSS is triggered when editing the category after the malicious code has been injected.
* The vulnerability has been reported as fixed.
