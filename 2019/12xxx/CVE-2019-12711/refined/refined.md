Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-12711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper restrictions on XML entities within the web-based interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (SME).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application does not properly restrict XML entities, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML code. This is specifically due to the lack of proper input sanitization for XML data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  An attacker could potentially retrieve files from the local system, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- **Malicious XML Requests:** An attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests containing malicious XML with references in XML entities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Access:**  The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access to Vulnerable System:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected Cisco Unified Communications Manager or Cisco Unified Communications Manager SME system.
