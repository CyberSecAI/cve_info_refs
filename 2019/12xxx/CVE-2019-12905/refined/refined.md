Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-12905:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. The application does not properly sanitize file names during file upload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows an attacker to upload a file with a malicious name containing JavaScript code. When a user accesses the page displaying the file name, the JavaScript code is executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Session hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect the victim to a malicious page.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content displayed on the page.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File upload:** The attacker exploits the file upload functionality of the application.
*   **Malicious filename:** The attacker crafts a filename containing malicious JavaScript code.
*  **User interaction:**  The XSS is triggered when another user views the file list which displays the malicious filename.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to file upload functionality:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the application. This could be via an authenticated user account, or if the upload functionality is exposed to the public.
*   **Knowledge of how to construct malicious filenames:** The attacker needs to be familiar with XSS techniques to craft a malicious filename.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided exploit uses the filename `â€œ><img src=x onerror=prompt(document.domain)>` . This filename, when displayed, will trigger the `onerror` event of the `<img>` tag which in turn executes the JavaScript `prompt(document.domain)` demonstrating the XSS vulnerability by displaying the domain of the application.
* The exploit uses an HTTP POST request to upload a file with the crafted malicious filename.
