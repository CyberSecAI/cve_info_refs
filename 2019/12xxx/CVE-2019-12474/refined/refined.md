Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper caching mechanism within the MediaWiki API's `ApiQueryRecentChanges.php` file. When querying recent changes using filters related to patrol status (specifically `patrolled`, `!patrolled`, `unpatrolled`, `autopatrolled`, and `!autopatrolled`), the API fails to set the appropriate cache mode to "private" when it should. This happens when an API call includes the mentioned patrol-related filters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The core weakness is the failure to enforce private caching for API responses that contain sensitive patrol status information. This allows privileged data about patrolled/unpatrolled edits to be potentially cached and exposed publicly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure. If a MediaWiki instance is configured to publicly cache API responses, an attacker could potentially gain access to information about whether recent changes have been patrolled, which is normally restricted to users with the patrol right.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector involves crafting a specific API request to `ApiQueryRecentChanges` that includes one of the problematic `rcshow` filters (`unpatrolled`, `!autopatrolled`, `autopatrolled`, `patrolled`, `!patrolled`), along with parameters that force public caching (e.g. `maxage` or `smaxage`). If the MediaWiki instance is configured to cache such responses, the information will be cached and potentially disclosed to unauthorized users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability lies in the potential for public caching of privileged information. The vulnerability is present when the API response is configured to be public.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The issue was identified by Lucas Werkmeister and tracked in Phabricator task T212118.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the cache mode is set to 'private' when any of these patrol-related filters are present in the API request.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple MediaWiki versions (1.27, 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, and 1.33).
*   The fix has been backported to older, supported versions of MediaWiki.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in the security releases of MediaWiki 1.27.6, 1.30.2, 1.31.2 and 1.32.2, and later versions.
*   The vulnerability was included in Debian Security Advisory DSA-4460-1.
*   Patches for the vulnerability were made available in Gerrit and are linked to the Phabricator task.
