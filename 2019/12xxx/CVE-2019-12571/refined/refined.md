Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12571:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN client for macOS handles the creation and overwriting of the `/tmp/pia-watcher.plist` file during connection initiation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The PIA client truncates and overwrites the `/tmp/pia-watcher.plist` file whenever a connection is established. If a user creates a symbolic or hard link to a file that they do not own to `/tmp/pia-watcher.plist`, the PIA client will still overwrite the linked file with the XML configuration, regardless of ownership.
*   **Lack of Privilege Checks:** The client does not perform adequate privilege checks before overwriting the file. It blindly overwrites the target of the symlink or hard link even if the linked file is owned by root or other privileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overwriting critical system files, an attacker could cause the system to malfunction or become unstable, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Data Loss:** Overwriting any user-owned or system file could result in data loss for the affected user.
*   **Possible Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** While the vulnerability itself does not directly lead to privilege escalation, a malicious actor could overwrite a root owned file that is utilized by a privileged process to gain arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable PIA client.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the file system by creating a symlink or hard link to a target file owned by another user or even the root user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privilege User:** The attacker must have local access with the ability to create symlinks or hard links. They do not need root privileges to perform the initial attack.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be able to interact with the PIA client to initiate a VPN connection, which triggers the file overwrite.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Version:** PIA VPN Client v0.9.8 beta (build 02099) for macOS.
*   **CVSS Score:** 7.1 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:U/RC:C)
*   **Steps to reproduce** are included in the text, providing practical details for understanding the exploit.
*   The vulnerability was reported on 2018-12-27, the vendor acknowledged receipt on the same day, and a fix was stated to be available in v83, however, this version was never released. Instead, the client was re-written. The vulnerability is fixed in v1.2.1+ of the new client
*   Public disclosure on 2019-06-10

This information provides a comprehensive understanding of the arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability in the specified version of the PIA macOS client.
