  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A memory leak vulnerability exists in the `con_insert_unipair` function within `drivers/tty/vt/consolemap.c`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to improper deallocation of memory when allocating a new bottom layer fails after registering a new middle layer.",
       "Use-after-free vulnerability due to clearing the wrong index in `p->uni_pgdir[]`"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory leak can lead to denial of service by exhausting system memory. The use-after-free issue can lead to unpredictable behavior and potentially system instability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user interacting with the console, specifically when adding or modifying Unicode character mappings.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have local access to the system to interact with the console and trigger the vulnerable code path."
  },
  "additional_details": {
      "fix_details": "The initial patch intended to fix the memory leak in `con_insert_unipair` was incorrect and introduced a different memory leak and use-after-free. The fix was reverted upstream and corrected.",
      "affected_products": [
        "Multiple NetApp products that incorporate Linux kernel",
         "Fedora 29 and 30"
