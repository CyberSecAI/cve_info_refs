Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2019-12457, CVE-2019-12458, CVE-2019-12459: Directory Listing**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper web server configuration or lack of directory indexing restrictions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Directory listing is enabled for certain directories in the FileRun application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can enumerate files and directories within the publicly accessible web directories. This can potentially expose sensitive information or internal application structure.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Direct access to the vulnerable URLs:
    *   `http://[server]/filerun/images/extjs/`
    *   `http://[server]/filerun/css/ext-ux/`
    *   `http://[server]/filerun/customizables/plugins/audio_player/`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special capabilities are required; a remote unauthenticated attacker can access the vulnerable URLs.

**CVE-2019-12905: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user-provided input (filename) before using it in an HTML context.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Stored XSS vulnerability exists due to the application's handling of filenames.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they interact with the file. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker uploads a file with a specially crafted filename containing JavaScript code e.g. `â€œ><img src=x onerror=prompt(document.domain)>.jpg`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the system.

**Open Redirect**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses user-controlled input (`theme` parameter) in a redirect without proper validation.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `theme` parameter in the `ext2ico.php` file is vulnerable to open redirection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can redirect users to an arbitrary URL, which can be used for phishing attacks or drive-by downloads.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `theme` parameter pointing to an external site: e.g. `/filerun/images/fico/ext2ico.php?theme=https://filerun.com/isaid:)?`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted request.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content includes Proof-of-Concept (PoC) HTTP requests demonstrating each of these vulnerabilities, which goes beyond the basic information found in a typical CVE description.
*   The content also provides remediation steps for the directory listing vulnerability.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The content demonstrates multiple vulnerabilities in the FileRun application: directory listing, stored XSS, and open redirection. An attacker with minimal capabilities can exploit these to cause a variety of issues.
