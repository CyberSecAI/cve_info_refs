## Details

USN-4308-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in Twisted. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

it was discovered that Twisted incorrectly validated or sanitized certain

URIs or HTTP methods. A remote attacker could use this issue to inject

invalid characters and possibly perform header injection attacks.

([CVE-2019-12387](/security/CVE-2019-12387))

It was discovered that Twisted incorrectly verified XMPP TLS certificates.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack and obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-12855](/security/CVE-2019-12855))

Jake Miller and ZeddYu Lu discovered that Twisted incorrectly handled

certain content-length headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to perform HTTP request splitting attacks. ([CVE-2020-10108](/security/CVE-2020-10108),

[CVE-2020-10109](/security/CVE-2020-10109))

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

However, because this version is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase and the flaw has a security impact of Moderate,  it is not currently planned to be addressed in future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata> * In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-twisted package.   ``` |  |

```
On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the
release of Twisted 19.2.1!

This is a security release, and contains the following changes:

- All HTTP clients in twisted.web.client now raise a ValueError when
called with a method and/or URL that contain invalid characters. This
mitigates CVE-2019-12387. Thanks to Alex Brasetvik for reporting this
vulnerability.

It is recommended you update to this release as soon as is practical.

Additional mitigation may be required if Twisted is not your only HTTP
client library:

- This bug is present in all current versions of urllib2 in CPython.
More information can be found on the Python bug tracker:
<https://bugs.python.org/issue30458>
- This bug was present in urllib3 up until version 1.24.3. More
information can be found on the urllib3 bug tracker:
<https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1553>

You can find the downloads at <<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted>> (or
alternatively <<http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>>). The NEWS
file is also available at
<<https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-19.2.1/NEWS.rst>>.

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

Fixes: ticket:9647

Twisted's HTTP client APIs were vulnerable to maliciously constructed
HTTP methods, hosts, and/or paths, URI components such as paths and
query parameters.  These vulnerabilities were beyond the header name
and value injection vulnerabilities addressed in:

<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9420>
[#999](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/999)

The following client APIs will raise a ValueError if given a method,
host, or URI that includes newlines or other disallowed characters:

- twisted.web.client.Agent.request
- twisted.web.client.ProxyAgent.request
- twisted.web.client.Request.__init__
- twisted.web.client.Request.writeTo

ProxyAgent is patched separately from Agent because unlike other
agents (e.g. CookieAgent) it is not implemented as an Agent wrapper.

Request.__init__ checks its method and URI so that errors occur closer
to their originating input.  Request.method and Request.uri are both
public APIs, however, so Request.writeTo (via Request._writeHeaders)
also checks the validity of both before writing anything to the wire.

Additionally, the following deprecated client APIs have also been
patched:

- twisted.web.client.HTTPPageGetter.__init__
- twisted.web.client.HTTPPageDownloader.__init__
- twisted.web.client.HTTPClientFactory.__init__
- twisted.web.client.HTTPClientFactory.setURL
- twisted.web.client.HTTPDownloader.__init__
- twisted.web.client.HTTPDownloader.setURL
- twisted.web.client.getPage
- twisted.web.client.downloadPage

These have been patched prior to their removal so that they won't be
vulnerable in the last Twisted release that includes them.  They
represent a best effort, because testing every combination of these
public APIs would require more code than deprecated APIs warrant.

In all cases URI components, including hostnames, are restricted to
the characters allowed in path components.  This mirrors the CPython
patch (for bpo-30458) that addresses equivalent vulnerabilities:

[python/cpython@bb8071a](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bb8071a4cae5ab3fe321481dd3d73662ffb26052)

HTTP methods, however, are checked against the set of characters
described in RFC-7230.

# USN-4308-1: Twisted vulnerabilities

19 March 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Twisted.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [twisted](/security/cves?package=twisted) - Event-based framework for internet applications

## Details

it was discovered that Twisted incorrectly validated or sanitized certain

URIs or HTTP methods. A remote attacker could use this issue to inject

invalid characters and possibly perform header injection attacks.

([CVE-2019-12387](/security/CVE-2019-12387))

It was discovered that Twisted incorrectly verified XMPP TLS certificates.

A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack and obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-12855](/security/CVE-2019-12855))

It was discovered that Twisted incorrectly handled HTTP/2 connections. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Twisted to hang or

consume resources, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-9512](/security/CVE-2019-9512), [CVE-2019-9514](/security/CVE-2019-9514),

[CVE-2019-9515](/security/CVE-2019-9515))

Jake Miller and ZeddYu Lu discovered that Twisted incorrectly handled

certain content-length headers. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to perform HTTP request splitting attacks. ([CVE-2020-10108](/security/CVE-2020-10108),

[CVE-2020-10109](/security/CVE-2020-10109))
