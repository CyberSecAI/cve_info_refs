- **Root cause of vulnerability:** MacDown fails to sanitize input on HTML attributes, allowing the use of the `file:\\` URI scheme.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization. Specifically, the application does not prevent the use of the `file:\\` URI scheme in HTML attributes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute code on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious markdown document containing HTML with a `file:\\` URI within an attribute, an attacker can trigger the execution of an arbitrary file when the user opens the document in MacDown.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious markdown file and get the victim to open it using MacDown.
