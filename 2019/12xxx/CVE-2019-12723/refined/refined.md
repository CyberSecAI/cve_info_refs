Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ajax/reorder.php` file of the GLPI Fields plugin. Specifically, the `container_id` and `old_order` parameters received via POST requests are not properly validated before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can manipulate the `container_id` and `old_order` parameters to inject malicious SQL code into the database queries executed by `reorder.php`. This is due to the code directly using the unsanitized parameters in the SQL `WHERE` clause.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Data Access and Modification:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass normal access controls and perform arbitrary actions on the database, including reading, modifying, and deleting data. This can lead to data breaches, loss of integrity, and potential disruption of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has elevated privileges, the attacker could leverage the vulnerability for privilege escalation by gaining access to sensitive data or performing administrative actions on the system through the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The attack vector is network-based, as the vulnerable script is accessible through HTTP requests.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker because `ajax/reorder.php` does not require user authentication. This makes the vulnerability highly accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `ajax/reorder.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication or special privileges on the target system, as the vulnerability exists in an unauthenticated portion of the plugin.

**Additional Notes**
* The fix for the vulnerability is mentioned in the changelog of release 1.10.0 and was addressed in pull request #317.
* The provided CVSS score indicates a critical vulnerability with a score of 9.8/10.
* The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (SQL Injection).
