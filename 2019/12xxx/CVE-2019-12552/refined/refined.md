Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of `destOffset` and `srcOffset` within the `Memcpy` function implementation of the 010 Editor template engine. These offset values can be negative, leading to memory underflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap Underflow:** The `Memcpy` function's internal implementation doesn't check for negative `destOffset` and `srcOffset` values. When these negative values are used, the code calculates a destination and source address by *adding* a negative offset, resulting in an address underflow.
- This underflow allows overwriting heap memory before the allocated buffer, potentially causing memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution (RCE):** By carefully manipulating the heap and controlling the underflow, an attacker can overwrite critical data structures (e.g., the "string object" pointer, GOT entries). The attacker can gain arbitrary read/write access which can eventually lead to remote code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory corruption caused by underflows can also lead to crashes and instability, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Templates:** A specially crafted template file (.bt) uploaded to the central 010 Editor repository. When a user downloads and opens a malicious template, the vulnerability can be exploited.
- **Malicious Files:** A victim can be tricked into opening a specially crafted file with a non-malicious template that uses the vulnerable `Memcpy` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Upload Access:** To upload a malicious template to the repository, the attacker needs to have upload privileges.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open a malicious file or template with 010 Editor.
- **Understanding of the Template Engine:** The attacker needs knowledge of the 010 Editor template engine and the heap layout to craft a successful exploit.
- **Target System Knowledge:** Knowledge of whether ASLR is enabled for the 010 Editor binary is helpful. If disabled, exploitation is simplified as memory addresses are consistent across different runs.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

The vulnerability is in the following code snippet:

```
Memcpy(arg1, arg2, n, dest_offset, src_offset)
  ...
  mov     edi, [rdx+8]    // dest_offset
  mov     rdx, [rax+20h]
  mov     rax, [rax+10h]
  mov     ecx, [r9+4]
  mov     esi, [rdx+8]    // src_offset
  mov     edx, [r8+4]
  mov     eax, [rax+8]
  sub     ecx, edi        // dest_len -= dest_offset 1) no check on dest_offset for negative value
  sub     edx, esi        // src_len -= src_offset   2) no check on src_offset for negative value
  cmp     ecx, edx        // if (dest_len < src_len)
  cmovle  edx, ecx        //   copy_length = dest_len
  cmp     edx, eax
  cmovg   edx, eax
  test    edx, edx
  jle     short loc_XXX
  movsxd  rdi, edi
  movsxd  rsi, esi
  add     rdi, [r9+8]     // dest += dest_offset     3) passing dest += dest_offset could lead to underflow
  add     rsi, [r8+8]     // src += src_offset       4) passing src += src_offset could lead to underflow
  movsxd  rdx, edx        // n
  call    _memcpy         ; Call Procedure
...
```

The assembly code clearly shows that `dest_offset` and `src_offset` are subtracted from `dest_len` and `src_len` respectively without any validation, and added to the base pointer without checks. This can cause a read/write outside of the allocated memory.

The provided content goes into more details about the exploitation of the vulnerability, outlining the steps to achieve code execution, such as:

1.  Overwriting the pointer of a string object with the address of a known function in the GOT.
2.  Using the overwritten pointer to read/write to arbitrary memory, allowing for GOT overwrites.
3. Overwriting a GOT entry with the address of `system` and triggering the corresponding function call.

The vulnerability was fixed in 010 Editor version 9.0.2.
