Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/app/controllers/EntityController.php` component of eLabFTW version 1.8.5, where it does not properly restrict file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files to the server without sufficient validation or sanitization. This means an attacker can upload any type of file, including those containing malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This would allow for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **File Upload:** The attacker includes a malicious PHP file within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the eLabFTW application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where eLabFTW is hosted.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit involves uploading a specially crafted PHP file (e.g., a web shell) through the vulnerable `/app/controllers/EntityController.php` component.
- Upon successful upload, the attacker can access the uploaded PHP file from the `uploads` directory (e.g., `https://[target site]/[elabftw directory]/uploads/[random 2 alphanum]/[random long alphanumeric].php5?e=whoami`) to execute commands on the server.
- The application does not prevent directory listing which can help attackers to locate the uploaded files.
