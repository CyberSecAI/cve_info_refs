The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12525.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the information found:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** When Squid is configured to use Digest authentication, it parses the `Proxy-Authorization` header. It searches for tokens like `domain`, `uri`, and `qop`. Squid checks if the value of these tokens starts and ends with a quote. If so, it performs a `memcpy` of its length minus 2.
*   **Missing Length Check:** Squid doesn't verify if the token's value is simply a single quote (`'`). This leads to `memcpy` calculating an incorrect length (length minus 1), resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper bounds checking during the `memcpy` operation.

**Impact:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service for all clients using the proxy.
*   **Memory Corruption**: Parsing of header Proxy-Authentication leads to memory corruption

**Attack Vector:**

*   A remote attacker could send a crafted HTTP request containing a `Proxy-Authorization` header with a single quote as the value for one of the tokens (domain, uri, qop).

**Affected Versions:**

*   Squid 3.3.9 through 3.5.28
*   Squid 4.x through 4.7

**Affected Systems:**

*   openSUSE Leap 15.0, 15.1
*   Ubuntu 19.04, 18.04 ESM, 16.04 ESM
*   Fedora 29, 30
*   SUSE Enterprise Storage 4, 5, 6, 7, 7.1
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise High Performance Computing 15 SP1, 15 SP2, 15 SP3, 12 SP5
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Module for Server Applications 15 SP1, 15 SP2, 15 SP3
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1, 15 SP2, 15 SP3, 12 SP5
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP1, 15 SP2, 15 SP3, 12 SP5
*   SUSE Manager Proxy 4.0, 4.1, 4.2
*   SUSE Manager Retail Branch Server 4.0, 4.1, 4.2
*   SUSE Manager Server 4.0, 4.1, 4.2
*   HPE Helion OpenStack 8

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Squid version 4.9 or later.
*   Apply the security patches provided by the respective distributions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Some sources mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution, while others only mention denial of service. The SUSE information rates the impact as high for availability but none for confidentiality and integrity.
*   Ubuntu 19.04 is more severely affected; Basic authentication handling issues could lead to arbitrary code execution as well as denial of service.
*   The SUSE information specifies that this vulnerability is related to HTTP Digest Authentication.
