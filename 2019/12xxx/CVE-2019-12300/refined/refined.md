Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that Buildbot was accepting and using OAuth authorization tokens directly for user authentication, instead of using them only for authorization as intended. This allowed a malicious user with access to another user's OAuth token to impersonate that user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication:** Buildbot was using OAuth authorization tokens for authentication, which is not the correct use of the token.
- **OAuth Token Misuse:** The system failed to distinguish between authorization and authentication processes when handling OAuth tokens.
- **Lack of proper validation:** The system was not validating that the token being used was generated for the specific client/user and not a generic one, therefore allowing for cross-user impersonation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a Buildbot instance as a legitimate user without knowing the user's Buildbot login credentials.
- **Impersonation:** The attacker could impersonate a victim user, gaining the same privileges and access as the victim.
- **Data Breach:** This could potentially lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within the Buildbot system depending on the permissions of the impersonated user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **OAuth Token Theft/Abuse:** An attacker must obtain a valid OAuth authorization token for a victim user. This could be achieved if the attacker has an authorized application with access to the same Identity Provider used by the Buildbot instance.
- **Token Submission:** The attacker submits this stolen token to the Buildbot system, where it's improperly used for authentication instead of only for authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authorized Application:** The attacker needs an application authorized to access user data at the same Identity Provider the Buildbot instance is configured to use for authentication.
- **Access to Victim User's Token:** The attacker needs to gain access to a victim's OAuth token through the malicious application.
- **Network Access to Buildbot Instance:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the targeted Buildbot instance to submit the malicious token.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affected Buildbot versions 0.9.5 to 1.8.1, and 2.0.0 to 2.3.0 (inclusive).
- It was fixed in Buildbot versions 2.3.1 and 1.8.2.
- The fix was implemented by ensuring the OAuth token is only used for authorization and not authentication and by validating the token against the client/user it was generated for.
- Mitigation included disabling the OAuth login feature or applying the provided patch (<https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/pull/4763/files>).
- The vulnerability was reported responsibly by Phillip Kuhrt.
