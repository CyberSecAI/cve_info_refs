Even something as simple as "buildbot --help" fails with:  bapiya. buildbot --help Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/bin/buildbot", line 6, in <module>     from pkg_resources import load_entry_point   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 3095, in <module>     @_call_aside   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 3079, in _call_aside     f(*args, **kwargs)   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 3108, in _initialize_master_working_set     working_set = WorkingSet._build_master()   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 570, in _build_master     ws.require(__requires__)   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 888, in require     needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))   File "/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py", line 774, in resolve     raise DistributionNotFound(req, requirers) pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'Tempita>=0.4' distribution was not found and is required by sqlalchemy-migrate   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  bapiya. rpm -q buildbot buildbot-1.6.0-2.fc28.noarch  How reproducible:  Always.

On 2019-May-28 Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 28. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '28'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 28 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1661951#c2)  Upstream Release Monitoring    2019-05-23 03:02:10 UTC  ``` Latest upstream release: 2.3.1 Current version/release in rawhide: 2.0.1-1.fc30 URL: <http://buildbot.net/> Please consult the package updates policy before you issue an update to a stable branch: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Updates_Policy> More information about the service that created this bug can be found at: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Upstream_release_monitoringPlease> keep in mind that with any upstream change, there may also be packaging changes that need to be made.

# CVE ID

* CVE-2019-12300

# Type

* Authentication vulnerability
* OAuth authorization token being used for user authentication

# Schedule

* **Reported**: 7 May 2019
* **Fix merged into master**: 9 May 2019
* **Fix in a release**: 22 May 2019

# Description

Buildbot accepted user-submitted authorization token from OAuth and used it to authenticate user.

# Impact analysis

The vulnerability can lead to malicious attackers to authenticate as legitimate users of a Buildbot
instance without knowledge of the victim's login credentials on certain scenarios.

If an attacker has an application authorized to access data of another user at the same Identity
Provider as the used by the Buildbot instance, then he can acquire a token to access the data
of that user, supply the token to the Buildbot instance and successfully login as the victim.

# Versions vulnerable

Buildbot 0.9.5 to 1.8.1, 2.0.0 to 2.3.0 (inclusive)

# Fixed versions

Buildbot 2.3.1 and 1.8.2

# Mitigations and patches

Either of the following can be used to mitigate the vulnerability:

OAuth login can be disabled in Buildbot configuration.

Patch can be applied: <https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/pull/4763/files>

Alternatively Buildbot can be upgraded to v2.3.1 or v1.8.2.

# Credits

* Thanks to Phillip Kuhrt for finding and reporting this vulnerability responsibly.
