Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-12742:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a commit message "Prevent non-administrators to change the password from other users" and a release note with the same description, suggesting it is relevant to a vulnerability related to unauthorized password changes. This aligns with the general nature of the provided CVE description, although the exact details cannot be confirmed with only the placeholder provided.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the user password change functionality where non-administrator users could potentially modify the passwords of other users. The code change in `bl-kernel/admin/controllers/user-password.php` reveals that the `username` parameter from the POST request was being used directly without proper verification, allowing a non-admin user to supply a different username.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Authorization Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before allowing a user to change another user's password. The code initially retrieves the username from the POST request (`$_POST['username']`) without verifying if the logged-in user has the rights to change the password of the specified user.
- **Direct Parameter Usage:** The code directly uses the `$_POST['username']` without sufficient validation or sanitization.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Password Changes:** A non-admin user could change the password of other users, potentially locking them out of their accounts.
- **Account Takeover:** In a scenario where a low privileged user can change an admin's password, this vulnerability could lead to complete compromise of the system

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface by submitting a crafted POST request to the password change functionality. An attacker would need to be a logged-in user of the system but doesn't require administrative privileges to perform the attack

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account on the Bludit system, although not an administrative account.
- **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web interface of the Bludit application and make POST requests to the user-password.php controller.

**7. Code Changes (from diff):**

The fix involves adding a check to ensure that non-admin users can only change their own password. Specifically, before using the username from `$_POST['username']`, the code now checks if the logged-in user is an administrator. If not, the username is overwritten with the logged-in user's username, effectively preventing the non-admin user from changing other users' passwords.

**Summary**

The provided information shows that CVE-2019-12742 is a vulnerability that allows non-admin users to change other users' passwords due to a lack of authorization checks. This is fixed by ensuring that non-admin users can only modify their own passwords.
