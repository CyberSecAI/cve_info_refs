Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12789:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Telus Actiontec T2200H modem allows a local attacker to gain root privileges via a special key sequence on the UART interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure UART Access:** The device exposes a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) interface that can be accessed by physically connecting an adapter.
- **Hardcoded/Unprotected Key Sequence:** A specific key sequence (Ctrl-\) at the login prompt on the UART interface bypasses the normal authentication mechanisms and grants root access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains root shell access on the device.
- **Full System Control:** With root access, the attacker can:
    - Read and write to the device's file system, including the firmware partitions
    - Modify the device settings
    - Disable features (remote management, updates)
    - Overwrite the flash storage, potentially bricking the device
    - Dump the firmware
- **Permanent modifications**

**Attack vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker requires physical access to the device to connect to the UART pins.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs to be physically near the device.
- **Hardware Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the device has a UART interface and be able to use a UART adapter.
- **Technical Skills:**  Basic knowledge of embedded systems, UART communication, and Linux commands.
- **No user-level credentials are required**

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   The vulnerable firmware version is T2200H-31.128L.08.
*   The attacker can use a tool such as a Raspberry Pi to interact with the UART.
*   The attacker can dump the firmware using "busybox dd" after achieving root.
*   The attacker can cross-compile a new busybox binary using buildroot.org
