The provided content discusses multiple crashes found in Edraw Max version 7.9.3. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** The first crash is identified as a heap corruption starting at `ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey`.
*   **Read Access Violations:** The second and third crashes are read access violations at the instruction pointer.

**Root Cause:**

The root causes of the vulnerabilities are not explicitly detailed, but they are triggered during fuzzing and are related to malformed/unexpected input to the Edraw Max application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a crash of the Edraw Max application.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The blog mentions that all identified crashes are marked as 'exploitable' by `msec.dll`. This suggests that these crashes could potentially be further exploited to gain arbitrary code execution by a skilled attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through malformed input provided to the Edraw Max application, likely through a file or data format that the application processes. The specific nature of the malformed input is not detailed.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

An attacker would need the ability to craft or modify files or data that are processed by the Edraw Max application. No specific user-interaction or special permissions is mentioned in the blog. The attacker would need knowledge of the file format or data structures processed by the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The crashes were identified through fuzzing.
*   The author provides a link to a zip archive containing the fuzzed samples and Windbg information to replicate the crashes.
*   The vulnerable application was installed on Windows 7 (x86).
*   The `msec.dll` library identifies the crashes as 'exploitable'.

This information provides more detail than a typical CVE description, outlining the crash types and potentially exploitable nature.
