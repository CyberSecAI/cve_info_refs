| [CVE-2024-50066](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-50066/ "CVE-2024-50066") | [In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/mremap: fix move\_normal\_pmd/retract\_page\_tables race In mremap(), move\_page\_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of page table entries should be moved.

At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called, which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd().  move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the destination.  The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it.  So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it through the file rmap:  process A                      process B =========                      ========= mremap   mremap_to     move_vma       move_page_tables         get_old_pmd         alloc_new_pmd                       *** PREEMPT ***                                madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)                                  do_madvise                                    madvise_walk_vmas                                      madvise_vma_behavior                                        madvise_collapse                                          hpage_collapse_scan_file                                            collapse_file                                              retract_page_tables                                                i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)                                                pmdp_collapse_flush                                                i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)         move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)           take_rmap_locks           move_normal_pmd           drop_rmap_locks  When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.  Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.  Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags, which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like that.  Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.") |  |

| [Show Quoted Text - 23 lines][Hide Quoted Text]The original report included the following:# Attacker can combine "CSRF vulnerability in Trean Bookmarks (defaultly installed on Horde Groupware)" and # "Stored XSS vulnerability in Horde TagCloud (defaultly   installed)" vulnerabilities to steal victim's emails.  # Also: # Attacker can use 3 different reflected XSS vulnerability to   exploit Remote Command Execution, SQL Injection and Code Execution.I am working on updating the Horde packages in Debian LTS, also   coordinating with the security team for an update to Debian stable,   and so some clarification would help.  It is clear that the TagCloud XSS (CVE-2019-12094) was fixed and the   associated commit was easy to find and applied cleanly to the Horde   package in Debian.  It is also clear that the CSRF (CVE-2019-12095)   has been deemed minor and not worth fixing.  However, it is not   clear that the "3 different reflected XSS vulnerability" have been   addressed.  Is there an additional vulnerability there beyond those   two which received CVE assignments?  Answering this would help   ensure that we properly track the state of Horde in Debian. | | | |

| Thanks for the follow-up.  I also asked MITRE and they offered the   following clarification:The stored XSS should be considered part of the CSRF vulnerability   in CVE-2019-12095, with the CSRF being the primary vulnerability.   The reflected XSS vectors are all covered by CVE-2019-12094.The CVE database entries have been updated as to be more clear. | | | |

| As far as I know those are the only two issues applicable to this   ticket. I think the third was the "exploit" of being able to obtain   IMAP messages via GET requests, from a webmail application... | | | |

| The original report included the following:# Attacker can combine "CSRF vulnerability in Trean Bookmarks   (defaultly installed on Horde Groupware)" and # "Stored XSS vulnerability in Horde TagCloud (defaultly installed)"   vulnerabilities to steal victim's emails.  # Also: # Attacker can use 3 different reflected XSS vulnerability to   exploit Remote Command Execution, SQL Injection and Code Execution.I am working on updating the Horde packages in Debian LTS, also   coordinating with the security team for an update to Debian stable,   and so some clarification would help.  It is clear that the TagCloud XSS (CVE-2019-12094) was fixed and the   associated commit was easy to find and applied cleanly to the Horde   package in Debian.  It is also clear that the CSRF (CVE-2019-12095)   has been deemed minor and not worth fixing.  However, it is not clear   that the "3 different reflected XSS vulnerability" have been   addressed.  Is there an additional vulnerability there beyond those   two which received CVE assignments?  Answering this would help ensure   that we properly track the state of Horde in Debian. | | | |

| For the record: \* The XSS in the Horde tag cloud widget had already been discovered,   fixed, and released by ourselves with Horde 5.2.21 on April 21, before   the report: <https://lists.horde.org/archives/announce/2019/001278.html>   Without this, the whole "attack" is not exploitable. \* Adding bookmarks in Trean is indeed not CSRF protected, but that's   low priority for us, because it's a non-destructive action. \* GETting IMAP messages from IMP is a core functionality of the   webmail client and is hardly to be called a vulnerability. Whether it   would make sense to token-protected such requests is at least debatable. \* The reporter irresponsibly disclosed his findings, because we were   not willing, nor able to pay him a bounty price upfront.  Also for the records, these finding have been assigned CVE 2019-12094   & CVE-2019-12095.  Conclusion: no Horde installation installed or updated since April   21st 2019 is vulnerable to this exploit. | | | |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
