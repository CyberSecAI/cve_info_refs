| 010 Editor - Release Notes Version 15.0.1 - October 11th, 2024  * Fixed 'Format > Comment Selection' was not detecting the proper syntax in most cases.* Fixed when opening a file as hex and switching to text mode, sometimes the current linefeeds were not displayed in the status bar.* Fixed 'View > Linefeeds > Initial Wrap State' was not being respected in some cases.* Fixed the ASCII+OEM character set was not displaying the first 32 characters properly.* Fixed input method editors now respect overwrite mode.* Fixed 'Copy as Text Area' was not properly copying some non-ASCII characters.* Fixed changing the Home/End keyboard shortcut on macOS was not working.  |  | | --- |   Version 15.0 - July 31st, 2024 The following is an overview of the new functionality in version 15.0 of 010 Editor:   * Added support for Tree-sitter syntaxes which provide real-time syntax parsing.* Tree-sitter allows high-quality syntax highlighting including coloring function names, custom data types, struct definitions, etc.* Over 45 Tree-sitter syntaxes are included and more can be installed from the internet.* Brace and Tag Matching: Placing the caret over a bracket '(' or ')' will underline that bracket and the corresponding bracket in the syntax. Works with HTML and XML tags too.* Jump between matching braces or tags with 'Find > Jump to Matching Brace/Tag'.* Double-clicking on a word in the text editor will automatically highlight all occurrences of that word in the document.* Dotted lines are now drawn vertically between code sections as identified by a Tree-sitter syntax (for example, 'if' or 'while' statements).* Added new 'Select' menu to the main menu with 'Select Word', 'Select Line' and 'Expand Selection'.* Use 'Expand Selection' to increase the current selection by stepping up the syntax tree (requires a Tree-sitter syntax or Binary Template).* Added animated scrolling when using page up/page down or jumping to positions in the file using Find, Goto, etc.* On Windows added Full Screen mode using 'View > Enter Full Screen'.* Added new themes 'Sunset Sky' and 'Bright Sky' which adjust syntax highlighting colors.   The following is a list of all new features in version 15.0 of 010 Editor:   * **Tree-sitter**   + Added support for Tree-sitter syntaxes in addition to regular syntaxes from Binary Templates.+ Tree-sitter performs real-time parsing of source code into a syntax tree and allows high-quality syntax highlighting, matching braces/tags, expand selection, drawing section lines, etc.+ Tree-sitter syntaxes added for Ada, ASM, Bash, Common Lisp, C/C++, C#, CSS, D, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, GLSL, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, JSON5, Julia, Kotlin, LaTeX, LLVM, LUA, Make, Markdown, MATLAB, Objective-C, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Powershell, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Scheme, SQL, Swift, Syntax010, TypeScript, XML, YAML, and Zig.+ Supports injections where source code from one syntax is placed inside of source code from another syntax and both are highlighted (for example, HTML containing JavaScript or CSS code).+ Select a syntax using 'View > Syntax' or by clicking the Syntax section of the Status Bar (both Tree-sitter and Binary Template syntaxes can be selected).+ The 'View > Syntax' menu shows recently used syntaxes and use 'View > Syntax > All Syntaxes (Tree-sitter)' to view all available syntaxes.+ Updating the Tree-sitter tree when editing is done using threads to preserve fast editing with large source code files.+ Additional Tree-sitter syntaxes can be downloaded from the internet and installed.+ Can print the current syntax tree to the Output panel using 'View > Syntax > Print Syntax Tree'. If bytes are selected only nodes that intersect those bytes and their parent nodes are displayed.+ If a different syntax is chosen for a file, the syntax is remembered the next time the file is loaded (see Remember Last Syntax in the Opening Files Options dialog).+ Large source code files are supported by dividing the file into multiple large blocks and each block is placed into a cache that can be cleared when too much memory is used.+ The block sizes and cache sizes can be controlled with the Cache Options dialog.+ When opening a file, the syntax is auto-detected using the file extension or a regular expression.+ Can parse big and little endian unicode files.+ New 'Syntax' page of the Options dialog to control the available Tree-sitter syntaxes.+ Syntaxes can be assigned a default 'Edit As' using the Syntax Option dialog.+ An option exists to turn off all Tree-sitter syntaxes in the Syntax Options dialog.* **Syntax highlighting**     + More detailed syntax highlighting is available using Tree-sitter syntaxes including coloring for functions, custom data types, struct definitions, etc.+ Renamed syntax style names to be consistent with Tree-sitter. For example 'code-comment' becomes 'comment' and 'tag-comment' becomes 'tag.comment'.+ Syntax styles can now display text as bold. Struct and function definitions are marked as bold in Templates and Scripts.+ Syntax highlighting works inside injections (one syntax inside another syntax).+ In Templates, the HighlightFindStyle function can use either the old or new syntax style naming scheme to locate styles.+ Better syntax highlighting of Binary Template .bt and Script .1sc files using Tree-sitter.+ Added 'tag.error' style for coloring unmatched tags.* **Creating and Editing Syntaxes**       + 010 Editor Tree-sitter syntaxes require two things: a dynamic link library (.dll/.so/.dylib) that parses the file into a set of symbols, and a .syntax010 file that maps from symbols to syntax styles.+ Syntax010 files are text files that can be edited within 010 Editor to customize the syntax highlighting.+ Use 'View > Syntax > Edit Syntax File' to edit the Syntax010 file for the current syntax.+ A Syntax010 file contain a series of S-expressions that can match part of a syntax tree and then use the @ operator to map to a syntax style name.+ Once a Syntax010 file has been edited, use 'View > Syntax > Refresh Syntax' to apply the changes or click the icon in the top-right corner of the editor.+ A Syntax010 file is similar to Tree-sitter's 'highlights.scm' file but with some extensions using #section.+ Use '#section match' to control how brace matching works for a syntax.+ Use '#section injection' to control how other syntaxes are injected into the current syntax.+ Use '#section fold' to specify which sections have fold lines drawn (code folding will be available in future versions).+ Supports regular expression matching with the #match? keyword.* **Matching Braces/Tags**         + When using a Tree-sitter syntax, placing the caret over a brace '(' or ')' will cause that brace and the matching brace in the syntax to be underlined.+ Brace matching can be used for different types of symbols such as {}, [], ().+ Underlining also works with tags such as HTML tags (e.g. <b>, </b>) or XML tags.+ Use 'Find > Jump to Matching Brace/Tag' to jump the caret from one matching brace or tag to the other.+ Click 'View > Syntax > Highlight Matching Braces/Tag' to toggle the display of the underlines.+ The background color of the braces can also be changed using the Match Brace/Tag color in the Theme/Colors Options dialog.+ Which braces or tags are matched can be controlled by editing the '#section match' area of the Syntax010 file (use 'View > Syntax > Edit Syntax File' to view the file).* **Section Lines**           + Dotted lines are now drawn vertically between code sections as identified by a Tree-sitter syntax.+ The lines can be turned off using 'View > Syntax > Show Section Lines'.+ Use the '#section fold' area of the current Syntax010 file to control where the lines are drawn (use 'View > Syntax > Edit Syntax File' to view the file).+ In the future these lines will indicate sections of code that can be folded.+ Control the color of the section lines using the Section Lines color in the Theme/Colors Options dialog.* **Auto-Highlight Selection**             + Double-clicking on a word in the text editor will select that word and also automatically highlight all other occurrences of the word in the file.+ By default a rectangle is drawn around each matching word in the document.+ The background color can also be set using the Auto-Highlight Selection color in the Theme/Colors Options dialog.+ Turn off highlighting by clicking 'View > Highlighting > Auto-Highlight Selection'.+ Auto-highlight is turned off by default for hex files but can be enabled using 'View > Highlighting > Auto-Highlight Selection'.* **Selection**               + Added new 'Select' menu to the main menu.+ Added 'Select Word' to select the word the caret is on. If the word is already selected, the next word in the file is selected.+ Added 'Select Line' to select the whole line the caret is on or expand the selection to include the starting and end lines.+ Added 'Expand Selection' to increase the current selection by stepping up the syntax tree (requires a Tree-sitter syntax to be active). Expand Selection also works when a Binary Template is active by selecting the parent variables in the hierarchy.+ Added 'Reverse Selection' to move the caret from the start of the selection to the end of the selection, or from the end of the selection to the start of the selection.+ Added 'Mark Selection Start' to mark the beginning of a selection at the current caret position and 'Mark Selection End' to mark the end. If both a start and end point are set then the bytes are selected.+ Added 'Move Selection Back' and 'Move Selection Forward' to move the selection forward or back by the number of bytes that are selected (useful in hex editing).+ Moved 'Select All', 'Select Range' and 'Column Mode' to the Select menu.* **Tables**                 + Using the mouse wheel to scroll in tables no longer selects a different row.+ Re-enable selecting rows using the mouse wheel by right-clicking on a table and selecting 'Column Display Format > Select by > Mouse Wheel Changes Selection'.* **Themes**                   + Added new themes 'Sunset Sky' and 'Bright Sky' which adjust syntax highlighting colors.+ Added the 'View > Themes' menu for easily changing the theme.+ Adjustments and fixes for many theme colors.+ Added separate color for text line numbers and tool bar handles.* **Editor**                     + Added animated scrolling when using page up/page down or jumping to positions in the file using Find, Goto, etc.+ Animated scrolling can be turned off in the Editor Options dialog.+ Changed the indicator when the editor is scrolled to the right from a shadow to a single line.+ Added 'Clear Replace Results' toggle to the Editor right-click menu to remove coloring from the editor after doing a replace all operation.+ Line numbers are now displayed by default.+ Added an extra space before line numbers (use the Text Editor Options dialog to turn this off).+ Breakpoints are displayed in the left-most column when line numbers are turned on.+ Highlighting the current line in the text editor now uses alpha blending.* **Find**                       + Renamed the 'Search' menu to 'Find' on the main menu.+ When searching for hex bytes using wildcards, ?? now indicates a single hex byte.+ When scrolling through find results, the editor will favor the left side of the editor (turn this off by unchecking Minimize Horizontal Scrolling in the Editor Options dialog).+ When searching for a Variable Name, search for a Variable Name and Value at the same time using the syntax <varname>=<varvalue>.* **Workspace**                         + The 'Path' column is now hidden by default.+ Show the 'Path' column by right-clicking on the Workspace or the header and choosing 'Show Path Column'.* **Inspector**                           + Right click on a value and choose 'Goto Address <value>' or 'Goto Sector <value>'.* **General**                             + Added Full Screen mode using 'View > Enter Full Screen'. Exit Full Screen mode using 'View > Leave Full Screen'.+ The default character set for text files is now UTF-8.+ Updated the Welcome page with multiple pages. Added a new page for selecting the theme and line number visibility.+ Auto-detect file type now tries to detect UTF-8 files.* **Templates and Scripts**                               + Added the SRand function to provide a seed value for Random.+ Added the BitfieldGetCurrentShift function to return the number of bits already read when defining bitfields.+ When searching for a Variable Name, search for a Variable Name and Value at the same time using the syntax <varname>=<varvalue>.+ Increased the number of levels the Template Results can open from 32 to MAXINT.+ Added default types int8, INT8, uint8 and UINT8.+ Using the Tab key to select the Template Results no longer resets the current selection.+ When editing a Template or Script, the syntax can now be chosen in the status bar (used to be hidden).+ Adjusted template style colors.* **Options**                                 + On the Editor page, New File Types can be set to use a Tree-sitter syntax or a Template syntax.+ On the Editor page, added Animated Scrolling toggle.+ On the Editor page, added Minimize Horizontal Scrolling toggle.+ On the Editor page, Caret Animation can be set to 'None' to create a solid, non-blinking caret.+ On the Text Editor page, added Show Spaces before Line Numbers.+ On the Opening Files page, added Remember Last Syntax toggle.+ On the Opening Files page, added Open Syntax Files drop-down list.+ On the Theme/Colors page, added Tool Bar Handle, Auto-Highlight Selection, Address Highlight, Match Brace/Tag, Auto-Highlight Selection, Section Lines, Hex Editor Addresses.+ On the Theme/Colors page, renamed a number of syntax styles.+ On the Theme/Colors page, renamed Scroll Shadow to Scroll Indicator Line.+ On the Directories page, added Syntax Directory and Syntax DLL Directory.+ Added Syntax page with a list of all available Tree-sitter syntaxes.+ On the Cache page, added Tree-sitter Block Size and Cache size.* **Bugs**                                   + Fixed a crash on macOS using drag-and-drop from an empty space in a file tab.+ Fixed a crash with regular expressions using look-behind when called from FindFirst/FindAll (possible in PDF.bt).+ Fixed sizeof was not properly returning an int64 in some cases.+ Fixed Find in Files was not remembering the Current Project setting when 010 Editor was restarted.+ Fixed using Find in Files when no files are open should use the character set from the Text Edit As (as using ANSI).+ Fixed in Find in Files, the 'in Files' field was not taking up the full width of the edit field.+ Fixed a possible crash with SScanf if passing a string to the wrong parameter.+ Fixed a crash in an unoptimized array inside an on-demand struct that was generated in a read function (possible in DEX.bt).+ Fixed selected tabs in each group were not restored properly when restarting and the startup action was 'Restore Open Files'.+ Fixed some issues using find whole word with numbers.+ Fixed problems using auto-indent on unicode source code.+ Fixed Move Lines Up/Down should not move a line that touches just the end of the selection.+ Fixed the Run Template at Offset action could not be assigned a shortcut key.+ Fixed when debugging, placing the mouse cursor over a string did not correctly show the value in certain cases.+ Fixed the end of file marker was sometimes not displayed when scrolling if line numbers were turned off.+ Fixed a bug using Select Range when the Template the Results panel was focused.+ Fixed StringToUTF8 was not properly converting characters in the range 0x80..0x9F (was using latin1 instead of ANSI).+ Fixed files having a BOM caused XML to not be detected correctly.+ Fixed a possible crash with HighlightCheckSingleLineRule when using an invalid regular expression.+ Fixed a problem displaying word wrap symbols on macOS.+ Fixed on macOS, path information is now added to the .zshrc file.+ Fixed issues with the end-of-file test when using unpadding bitfields.+ Fixed some issues drawing the enum drop-down button in the Template Results.+ Fixed a problem using fgcolor/bgcolor custom functions with big-endian data.  |  | | --- |   Version 14.0.1 -

The following is a list of all new features in version 12.0 of 010 Editor:   * **Mini Map**   + Added an overview diagram called the *Mini Map* to the right side of each editor.+ The Mini Map shows a zoomed out view of each file and works for both text and hex files.+ The Mini Map can be hidden, resized, zoomed, or moved to either side of the editor.+ Scrolling the editor automatically scrolls the Mini Map.+ Bytes selected or highlighted in the Editor are highlighted in the Mini Map.+ View options for the Mini Map by clicking 'View > Mini Map > Mini Map Options' or by right-clicking on the Mini Map.+ The Mini Map can also be viewed in the new Visualize tab, located in the Inspector tab group.+ Can click and drag on the line separating the Mini Map and Editor to resize the Mini Map.+ The Hex Editor Mini Map takes each color of the file and lightens or darkens the color depending upon the byte value (byte values closer to zero darken the color and byte values closer to 255 lighten the color).+ The amount of lightening or darkening can be controlled with the Contrast and Brightness sliders in the Mini Map Options dialog.+ Colorize algorithms can be performed on the Hex Editor Mini Map to apply color maps to the data.+ Choices for colorize include ASCII Sections, Rainbow, Heat, Ocean, Gray and Custom.+ The number of bytes per line of the Mini Map can be controlled with the Hex Editor Mini Map Options dialog.+ The Hex Editor Mini Map automatically changes the line width when the control is resized.+ Line width of the Hex Editor Mini Map can be snapped to certain values with the Auto Snap setting (e.g. by default the width snaps to values of 16, 32, 48, 64, etc.).+ Hovering the mouse over the Mini Map shows a highlighted rectangle, indicating the portion of the Mini Map that is visible in the Editor.+ Clicking and dragging on the highlighted rectangle scrolls the Mini Map and Editor.+ Clicking on a line of the Mini Map that is not in the highlighted rectangle centers the editor on that line.+ After clicking on a line outside the highlighted rectangle, keep the mouse button down and move the mouse up or down to perform a velocity scroll (useful for large files).+ Clicking the Reset button in the Mini Map Options dialog returns the Mini Map to its initial state.+ The Mini Map supports high-DPI displays.+ Some colors for the Mini Map can be controlled with 'Tools > Options > Theme/Colors'.* **Style**     + The Dark theme can now be applied to scroll bars and dialogs.+ Tabs and headers are now rounded by default (this can be turned off using 'Tools > Options > Theme/Colors' and under 'Options' uncheck 'Rounded Tabs').+ Can customize the colors of scroll bars, main menu/right-click menus, tool tips, and dialogs using the 'Theme/Colors' page of the Options dialog.+ Can change the color of the open/close children arrows in Tables.+ Changed the drawing of splitter buttons in scroll bars.+ The scroll bar for text files now hides the bottom splitter button by default.+ The Mini Map is now integrated with the scroll bars.* **Disassembler**       + Added disassembler for X86 (64-bit/32-bit/16-bit), ARM (64-bit/32-bit), MIPS (64-bit/32-bit), PowerPC (64-bit/32-bit), SPARC, SystemZ, and XCore.+ New Disassembler Tool on the tools menu for disassembling a section of hex data.+ Results are displayed in the Disassembler Output Window as a new tab in

running the disassembler.+ Has disassembler options for ARM v8, ARM MClass, ARM Thumb Mode, MIPS Micro, MIPS 32r6, MIPS ii, MIPS iii, PowerPC QPX, SPARC v9.+ Endianness is supported for ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC.+ Define the architecture for an Opcode in a Template using DisasmSetMode or <disasm=<constant>> after an Opcode.+ Can include options for disasm using '|', for example "<disasm=(DISASM\_ARM\_32|DISASM\_OPTION\_ARM\_THUMB)>".+ Opcode variables can be a variable number of bytes.+ Use the 'sizeof' operator to query the size of an Opcode.+ Can display disassembly results in Intel or AT&T syntax ('mov rbx, rcx' versus 'movq %rcx, %rbx').+ Added new functions DisasmNumOps, DisasmOpString, DisasmGetMode, DisasmSetMode, DisasmOpSizeFromFile, and DisasmOpStringFromFile.+ Special Opcode array can be used to perform disassembly on a large block of data at once.+ When defining an Opcode array, place the number of bytes between the brackets '[' and ']' (the number of resulting Opcodes can be queried with DisasmNumOps).+ Note local opcodes are not currently supported but the DisasmOpSizeFromFile and DisasmOpStringFromFile functions can be used to do disassembly in a script.+ Can right-click on the Disassembly results and choose 'Clear' to clear the table.* **Templates and Scripts**         + Special attributes such as <read> and <write> can now be written inline instead of writing a separate function.+ Inline functions can be written by calling a function and then including arguments inside brackets '(' and ')' where each argument can be an expression. For example: <read=Str("%lg", this / 256.0)>+ Inline functions can also be written by enclosing an expression inside brackets '(' and ')'. For example: <comment=("ID = " + id)>+ New 'Str' function which works like Printf but returns a string instead of writing it to the Output Window.+ fgcolor and bgcolor attributes can now be a function or expression.+ When writing inline functions, use 'this' to refer to the current variable (or this[0], test[1], etc. if this is an array).+ Inline functions are supported for read, write, comment, size, name, fgcolor, bgcolor and disasm attributes.+ Inline write functions should assign to a variable and should use 'value' to refer to the input string.+ New 'Opcode' type to support using the Disassembler in Templates and see the Disassembler section above for other changes to Templates.+ New 'disasm' special attribute for setting the architecture to use when performing disassembly.+ Added 'Log10' function.* **Inspector**           + 'Opcode (X86-32)', 'Opcode (X86-64)', 'Opcode (ARM-32)' and 'Opcode (ARM-64)' have been added to the Inspector.* **Options**             + Can now control colors for the Dialogs, Menu/Right Click Menu, Scroll Bars, and the Mini Map on the 'Theme/Colors' page.+ Theming of dialogs or scroll bars can be turned on or off using the 'Native Dialogs' or 'Native Scroll Bars' toggle in the Options drop-down list.+ Rounding for Tabs or Headers can be turned on or off using 'Rounded Tabs' or 'Rounded Headers' in the Options drop-down list.* **General**               + Added SHA-384 to Checksum algorithms.+ Updated app icon.+ Updated EULA for libraries.+ Changed style of Hex Operations dialog.+ Selecting a row in the Find results table shows the index of the row in the status bar, for example "(3/9)" means the third out of 9 rows was selected.+ Added 'Hide my license' option to the Register dialog.+ Added section to the manual about Multi-Line Regular Expressions.* **Linux**                 + Some versions of Linux were crashing when copying large blocks of data from 010 Editor to other applications. A limit to the number of bytes that can be copied was added to the 'General' page of the Options dialog and this limit can be turned off on the same page.+ Some versions of Linux were having issues with certain Input Method Editors (IMEs). As such, IMEs are turned off by default on Linux but can be re-enabled using the 'Allow Input Method Editors' toggle on the 'Editor' page of the Options dialog.* **Bug Fixes**                   + Fixed a bug with regular expressions possibly finding a double match when a find result was over a 64K barrier.+ Fixed a problem editing some Template variables while a breakpoint is hit.+ Fixed loading files on Unix containing backslash '\' characters.+ Fixed issues with the ruler drawing on some high-DPI systems.+ Fixed a crash with certain scripts that write to text files.+ Fixed changes to fonts sometimes were not properly updated in the dialogs when pressing ok in the Options dialog.+ Fixed some Scripts were not working properly when run with -noui.+ Fixed the Open Process dialog was showing some heaps as having modules that did not belong to a module (Process tab was ok).+ Fixed the Open Process dialog was not showing some 64-bit addresses correctly (Process tab was ok).+ Fixed issues displaying Templates or Scripts that have been deleted from the Repository.+ Fixed when importing Motorola S19/S27/S37, data after a S7/S8/S9 record is now properly read.+ Fixed the printer dialog was not working on some Linux systems.+ Fixed a typo in the recent files list.  |  | | --- |   Version 11.0.1 - Nov 9th, 2020  * When opening a .LNK file, a dialog now asks whether to open the target of the LNK file or the LNK file itself. The LNK open action can also be controlled in the Editor Options dialog.* On the Bookmarks tab of the Inspector added *Import...* to the right-click menu to import a CSV file of bookmarks.* Fixed a string sometimes did not display properly in the Variables tab when debugging a script.* Fixed can get a crash setting a watch on a local struct.* Fixed sometimes a local struct in a script could not access other variables inside the local struct.* Fixed the opacity sliders were not saved properly in the Theme/Colors Dialog page on exiting 010 Editor.* Fixed ReadByte/ReadInt/ReadInt64/etc. did not properly take the file offset into account when called with no arguments.* Fixed a possible corruption of the 010 Editor cfg file when closing multiple instances of 010 Editor at the same time.* Fixed a possible crash running scripts which modify linefeeds in a text file.* Fixed a possible crash in SScanf using a string which is not null-terminated.* Fixed a possible crash calling ReplaceAll in a script.* Fixed some scripts were not properly updating the modified state after being run.* Fixed when a Template was modified, the Template icon disappeared from the file in the Workspace.* Fixed the Bookmarks panel was not displaying the type name properly on some systems.  |  | | --- |   Version 11.0 - September 30th, 2020 The following is an overview of the new functionality in version 11.0 of 010 Editor:   * New default editor font "Droid Sans Mono" and new themes "Starry Sky" and "Morning Sky".* Simplified editor display and the bar above each editor has been hidden (Run Template and Run Script are moved to icons in the Tool Bar and Edit As and Syntax are moved to the Status Bar).* Run, Repository and Debug icons are now displayed in the top-right corner of a Script or Template as overlaid icons.* Can run a Template at the current cursor position or on a selection by right-clicking on a Hex Editor and choosing *Run Template at Offset*.* Improved Status Bar which includes a number of popup sections.* 'local' structs are now supported in Templates and Scripts.* Capture groups / backreferences can be used when replacing with Regular Expressions.* When selecting bytes, the selection color is now blended with the existing colors allowing information to show through the selection.

relative to the start of the file by default but can be shown relative to the offset by right-clicking on the *Start* column and selecting *Start Addresses > From Offset*.* **Templates and Scripts - Local structs**           + The 'local' keyword can be used with structs to declare a struct as in regular C.+ Local structs can be used in Scripts as well as Templates but must be declared with the 'local' keyword.+ All variables defined inside a local struct are automatically local but sub-structs must still be declared with the 'local' keyword.* **Templates and Scripts - Functions**             + Added new functions for working with GUIDs: GUIDToString and StringToGUID.+ Added new functions for display formats: GetDisplayFormat and SetDisplayFormat.+ Added new functions for keep file time: GetKeepFileTime and SetKeepFileTime.+ Added new functions for checking status: IsBitfieldLeftToRight, IsBitfieldPaddingEnabled and IsUndoEnabled.+ Added new functions for running Templates at an offset: OffsetGetStart, OffsetSetStart, OffsetGetLimitSize, OffsetSetLimitSize, OffsetClear.+ In the FindInFiles function added an option to follow symbolic links.+ In the AddBookmark function changed arraysize to int64.+ Function GetFileNum now returns -1 if it is called in a Script which has no file target instead of causing a runtime error.* **Tool Bars**               + Added new Run Template and Run Script icons which display a drop-down list of Templates or Scripts to run.+ The drop-down list from the Run Templates or Run Scripts icon shows a list of Open, Installed or Recent Templates or Scripts.+ Hid the Change Font and Endian icons in the Tool Bar (can be shown by right-clicking on the Tool Bar and select *Font* or *Endian*, and note Endian is still visible in the Status Bar).+ Improved rendering and changed style of some Tool buttons.+ Tool Bars can now be docked to the left or right side of the application.+ Reordered icons in the View tool bar.+ Can change text and disabled text color of tool bar items with the Options dialog.+ Added icons to the Run Template drop-down to open the Template Repository dialog or Run Template at Offset.+ Added an icon to the Run Script drop-down to open the Script Repository dialog.* **Status Bar**                 + Reorganized the Status bar into 3 sections and changed the style on some operating systems.+ Most Status Bar panels can now be clicked to show a popup menu or change status (clickable panels highlight and show an up-arrow).+ The central section of the status bar shows different information depending if a Text or Hex file is shown.+ For Text files, the central section shows Edit As, Syntax Highlighter, Character Set, Linefeeds, and Tabs (also shows Endian for Unicode character sets).+ For Hex files, the central sections show Edit As, Character Set and Endian.+ Clicking on the Position, Byte Value or Size panel shows a popup used to change units or open the Goto or Set File Size dialogs.+ Binary is no longer shown in the Byte Value panel (moved to Inspector) but can be shown by clicking on the panel and selecting *Byte Value Units*.+ Commas are shown by default in the File Size panel but can be turned off by left-clicking and selecting *File Size Units*.+ Clicking on the Edit As panel shows a popup menu to choose a new Edit As (e.g. Text, Hex, Binary, etc.).+ Clicking on the Syntax Highlighting panel shows a popup to choose a new Syntax Highlighter or turn off Syntax Highlighting.+ Syntax Highlighting panel shows 'Plain' if no Syntax Highlighter has been chosen.+ Clicking on the Character Set panels shows a popup to select a new character set or convert to a different character set.+ Linefeeds panel now shows 'CRLF' for DOS linefeeds 0D0A, 'LF' for Unix linefeeds 0A, or 'CR' for Mac linefeeds 0D.+ Clicking on the Linefeeds panels shows a popup menu to convert to a different type of linefeed.+ Tabs panel now shows SPC if inserting spaces or TAB if inserting tabs.+ Clicking on the Tabs panel shows a popup menu to change the tab settings.+ Clicking on the Endian panel toggles the endian and no longer shows a popup menu.+ Added more information to hints for the panels.* **Repository**                   + A Repository icon is displayed in the top-right corner of a Script or Template editor and clicking the icon displays the Repository menu.+ The Repository icon changes depending upon the status of the file (gray means the file is not in the repository and blue means the file is in the repository).+ On the Repository menu, renamed some menu items from 'Submit File...' to 'Submit to Repository...' and 'Update' to 'Update from Repository...'.+ When editing a Script or Template, the Repository menu can also be accessed from the editor right-click menu.+ On the Help menu added *View Repository Status* and *View Repository History*.+ The Repository dialog shows tabs on the bottom and has a new style.+ In the Repository history dialog, the Comment field now displays the description of the file for the initial version.* **Capture Groups / Backreferences**                     + When doing a Replace operation with Regular Expressions, backreferences (capture groups) can be used in the replace string.+ Brackets ( and ) can be used in a Regular Expression to create a capture group.+ Use \1 up to \9, or $1 up to $9 to reference capture groups 1 through 9.+ Use \k<n> or ${n} where n is any integer to reference capture group 10 or higher.+ Named capture groups can be created in a Regular Expression using (?<name>...)+ A backreference to a named capture group can be created with \k<name> or ${name} in the replace string.+ Used capture group \0 or $0 to reference the text matching the whole regular expression.+ The codes \t, \n, \r, \a, \e, \f, \v, and \xHH can now be used in the replace string.* **Debugging**                       + When the debugger is active, the Continue, Stop, and Step icons are overlaid on the top-right corner of the Script or Template being debugged.+ The Debug Tool Bar is now hidden by default but can be shown with '*View > Tool Bars > Debug*'.+ By default only a Pause button is displayed in the Tool Bar which can be used to pause or stop a running Script or Template.+ The icon was changed to a double-arrow for Continue.+ Breakpoint indicators were resized and fixed for drawing issues.* **Workspace**                         + Added a Table header with File and Path sections to the Workspace to be more consistent with other tabs.+ Modified files are now shown as bold (can turn this off by right-clicking on the Workspace and selecting *Options*).+ Only show icons now for Scripts, Templates, Drives and Processes (removed file icon for regular files).+ Possible to display folders with bold text (right-click on the Workspace and select *Options*).* **Inspector**                           + 'Binary' and 'GUID' have been added to the Inspector.+ The Inspector.bt file has been added to the Repository which can be used to customize the Inspector.* **Find and Replace**                             + Added new Find Next/Previous icons.+ Tool buttons in Find Bars work better with popup issues fixed.+ In Find in Files, added an option *Follow Symbolic Links*. Turning this off ignores directories that are symbolic links.+ In the Find Bar, text is now not automatically converted to uppercase before being displayed in the bar.+ Lines used to resize sections of the Find bar are now drawn as solid instead of dotted.* **General**                               + In the Calculator, when multiplying two integers the multiplication is now done as an int64 to prevent overflow.+ Added '*View > Linefeeds > Show Wrap Line*' to allow drawing a wrap line even when wrapping is turned off.+ '*View > Character Set > Use Default Char Set*' menu option now includes the name of Edit As to be more clear.+ When a license for a previous version of 010 Editor is entered in the Register dialog, clicking the 'Check License' button displays the greatest version the license can run.+ Renamed 'File Interface' to 'Edit As' in the interface and the documentation.+ Each Dock Header now highlights when the mouse is placed over them when they are docked.+ Added '*View > Status Bar > Byte Value Units*' to control what is displayed in the Status Bar Byte Value panel.+ Reordered the '*View > Font*' menu.+ Added the '*View > File Bar*' menu.+ Added *Insert Tabs* to the '*View > View Tabs/Whitespace*' menu.+ On macOS removed the '*View > Show Tab Bar*' menu option.+ The tear marker on File Tabs is easier to see.+ Improved style and drawing in the Explorer tab.+ Clear All Bookmarks action now asks for confirmation before proceeding.+ Added scroll bars to the tutorial for long pages.* **Options**                                 + New style for the Options dialog.+ Scroll bars are automatically displayed now when resizing the dialog.+ Renamed *File Interface* page to *Edit As*.+ Renamed *Keyboard* page to *Shortcuts*.+ On the Fonts page added *Application Font* and *Dock Header Font*.+ On the Fonts page added *Set Old Editor Fonts* button to set editor fonts to fonts used in previous versions of 010 Editor.+ On the Editor page added *Show Shadow when Horizontally Scrolled* option.+ On the Edit As page the names of the linefeeds have changed.+ On the Compiling page added *Show Target File after Running Script/Template*.+ On the Theme/Colors page added new styles *Starry Sky* and *Morning Sky*.+ On the Theme/Colors page older styles are listed in the -----Older Themes----- section.+ On the Theme/Colors page added option for native drawing of Tool Buttons and Table Headers.+ On the Theme/Colors page some colors have an opacity slider for blending with the background color (0% means transparent and 100% means fully opaque).+ On the File Dialogs page the directory for Open File, Open Template and Open Script can be set to *Current File Location / Last Used Directory* or *Current File Location / Last Used ???

February 14th, 2020  * On macOS the application is now notarized.* Upgraded to a new version of our user-interface library.* Removed support for Windows XP, 32-bit macOS, and Ubuntu 10.04 to 15.10.* Better support for high-DPI displays.* Fixed a possible crash changing the text editor or hex editor font using the Options dialog.* Fixed in the Find in Files results, sometimes the file names would be incorrectly truncated.* Fixed a redraw issue when working with very large hex files and pressing Ctrl+A.* Fixed Overwrite File was incorrectly removing bookmarks when data was modified.* Fixed the Bookmark dialog was incorrectly truncating array sizes that were more than 4 GB.* Fixed an incorrect status bar message displayed when hovering over the new file icon.* Fixed the Register dialog was missing a Taskbar Icon if displayed before the main application started.* Fixed the warning for running a template which generates a large number of variables was not being displayed.* Added more checks a for corrupt configuration file on macOS.  |  | | --- |   Version 10.0 - December 6th, 2019 The following is an overview of the new functionality in version 10.0 of 010 Editor:   * A full debugger is now available for finding and fixing problems with Templates and Scripts.* The debugger can be accessed using the *Debug* menu and includes stepping, breakpoints, watches and a call stack.* Templates and Scripts are now threaded, meaning other editing operations can be done while a Template or Script is running.* When using the Text Editor, line numbers and ruler labels are now hidden by default (they can be shown with '*View > Addresses > Show Addresses*' or '*View > Ruler > Show Labels*').* When line numbers or ruler labels are hidden, hover the mouse over the address column or ruler for a second to display a hint popup with the hidden information.* '*View > Tabs/Whitespace > Show Whitespace*' now can be used to visualize linefeed types for each line.   The following is a list of all new features in version 10.0 of 010 Editor:   * **Debugger**   + A full debugger is now included for finding and fixing problems with 010 Editor Templates and Scripts.+ Added a new *Debug* menu for controlling the debugger.+ Debugging can be turned on or off using the '*Debug > Debugging Enabled*' menu option.* **Debugger Program Flow**     + Scripts or Templates can be run the usual way (for example with '*Scripts > Run Script*' or '*Templates > Run Template*') or by selecting a Script or Template and clicking '*Debug > Start Debugging*'.+ If debugging is enabled and a breakpoint is hit in the Script or Template, program execution will pause (see the next section for information on breakpoints).+ When paused a yellow arrow will indicate the current debug active line in the Text Editor.+ Use '*Debug > Step Over*' to step to the next line of the file, jumping over any functions or structs that are called.+ Use '*Debug > Step Into*' to step to the next line of the file and step into any functions or structs that are called.+ Use '*Debug > Step Out*' to execute the rest of the current function or struct and stop at the first statement outside the function or struct.+ To continue running a paused Script or Template click '*Debug > Continue*', '*Scripts > Continue Script or Template*' or '*Templates > Continue Script or Template*'.+ To pause a running Script or Template click '*Debug > Pause*'.+ To stop a running or paused Script or Template click '*Debug > Stop*' or press Shift+Esc (note this has changed from the Esc key in previous versions).+ Scripts or Templates are now run threaded meaning other editing operations can take place when a Script or Template is running.+ If stepping to a line in an include file, the include file is automatically opened in the editor.+ Right-click on a Script or Template and choose *Run to Cursor* from the right-click menu. The Script or Template will run (or continue) and execution will stop at the chosen line or at the first breakpoint encountered.+ When a Script or Template is stopped, click '*Debug > Step Into*' to start the program and stop at the first executable line.+ When stepping through a Template and the last line of the Template Results or Variables tab is selected, if any new variables are appended to the table then the selection will be moved to the last created variable.* **Breakpoints**       + A breakpoint marks a line to stop in the Script or Template and is marked by a red arrow in the left-hand column of the Text Editor.+ Set or clear a breakpoint for the current line using '*Debug > Toggle Breakpoint*' or by left-clicking the left-hand column in the Text Editor.+ If a breakpoint is set on a non-executable line then the breakpoint will be moved to the next line that is executable when the Script or Template executes.+ Breakpoints are persistent (saved to disk) but this can be changed using the Compiling page of the Options dialog.+ If debugging is disabled then no breakpoints will be hit and the breakpoints are displayed as red outlines in the Text Editor.+ If the Script or Template is modified when program execution is paused then breakpoints will be disabled. The breakpoints will be displayed as outlines with a solid arrow head.+ A list of all breakpoints can be found in the Breakpoints tab, which is found in the Inspector tab group or by clicking '*Debug > View Breakpoints*'.+ In the Breakpoints tab, right-click on the table and select *Add Breakpoint* to set a breakpoint by line number.+ All breakpoints in all files can be deleted by clicking '*Debug > Delete All Breakpoints*'.+ The color of breakpoints or the active line marker can be controlled using the Theme/Colors page of the Options dialog.+ Note that breakpoints are not hit when the application is starting up and any files are being reloaded.* **Variable Hints**         + When program execution is paused and the mouse is placed over a variable name in the Script or Template, a hint popup will display the value of the variable.+ When a selection is made in the Script or Template and the mouse is placed over the selection, the selection will be evaluated and the results displayed in a hint popup.+ Currently only simple functions (sizeof, startof, exists, etc) can be evaluated in a selection and open the Quick Watch dialog to evaluate a selection which contains more complex functions.+ Note that how variables are scoped can be affected by the Call Stack tab.+ Variable hints can be turned off using the Compiling page of the Options dialog.* **Watches**           + Watches can be set in the *Watch* tab found in the Inspector tab group or by clicking '*Debug > View Watches*'.+ Add a watch by double-clicking on the first empty line in the Name column or by right-clicking on the Watch tab and choosing *Add Watch*.+ A watch can be almost any expression or variable name (for example, 'FileSize()-1000' or 'blocks[i].data[10]').+ Watches are evaluated every time program execution is paused (e.g. a breakpoint is hit) or when the program is stepped to the next line.+ If the result of a watch is a struct, the struct can be opened and explored similar to the Template Results.+ To delete a watch use the Delete key or right-click on a watch and choose *Remove Watch*.+ A single list of watches is kept for the entire application.+ Note that how variables are scoped can be affected by the Call Stack tab.* **Quick Watch**             + Expressions can also be evaluated without creating a watch using the Quick Watch dialog ('*Debug > Quick Watch*').+ Enter an expression in the *Expression* field and click *Evaluate*.+ The result of the expression or variable is displayed in the *Value* column.+ A list of recent expressions is available by clicking the Down arrow in the dialog.+ Click the *Add Watch* button to add the current expression to the *Watch* tab.+ If a selection is made in the Text Editor before the Quick Watch dialog is opened, the selection is copied to the Expression field and evaluated.* **Debugging Runtime Errors**               + If a runtime error occurs in a Template or Script a popup dialog box will be displayed asking to start the debugger.+ When debugging errors the cursor is placed on the line that caused the error.+ Variables can be investigated with Variable Hints in the Text Editor or with watches.+ Clicking *Continue* or stepping to the next line will stop the Script or Template.+ Select the *Always use this action* toggle in the popup dialog box to always start the debugger or never start the debugger.+ Whether the debugger starts on an error can also be controlled with the Compiling page of the Options dialog.* **Call Stack**                 + The Call Stack is available in the *Call Stack* tab which can be found in the Inspector tab group or by clicking '*Debug > View Call Stack*'.+ When program execution is paused, the Call Stack lists the functions or structs that were called to reach the current execution point.+ The current function or struct is listed at the top of the call stack and the function or struct which called that function or struct is listed below it.+ If execution is not inside a function or struct then *(Main Program)* is listed in the call stack.+ Double-clicking on a function or struct jumps to the last position inside that function or struct.+ Double-clicking on a function or struct also makes any local variables inside the function or struct in local scope (this affects any watches or Variable hints in the Text Editor).* **Debugger Limitations**                   + Currently breakpoints are not hit inside custom read/write/name/comment functions that are called from the Template Results or Variables tab. To debug these functions call them directly inside the Template.+ Currently breakpoints in on-demand structures are not hit when the structure is created by opening it in the Template Results. To debug these functions trigger creation of the struct directly in the Template by accessing a variable inside the struct.+ Currently breakpoints are not hit inside the HighlightLineRealtime or HighlightBytesRealtime functions. To debug these functions see the *Using the Debugger* help topic in the manual for sample code to call.* **Templates and Scripts**                     + A full debugger including breakpoints, watches and call stack is now available for Templates and Scripts.+ Templates and Scripts are now threaded, meaning other editing operations can be done while a Template or Script is running.+ When a Template is running click '*Templates > Stop Template*' or press Shift+Esc to cancel the Template.+ When a Script is running click '*Scripts > Stop Script*' or press Shift+Esc to cancel the Script.+ On-demand Structures which have arguments are now supported.+ Custom read functions can now be called on structs with zero size.+ Custom name/comment functions now work for local variables.+ After selecting a Script or a Template that has been run, the Variables tab now shows the list of variables created by that Script or Template.+ If an included file is opened and modified in the editor, the modified version is used when compiling instead of the disk version.+ Which warnings are displayed in the Output panel can be configured using the *Compiling* page of the Options dialog.+ When the application is starting up and files are being reloaded, the Output panel shows the results from all Templates that were run.+ The Template Results panel only shows the results from a syntax highlighting template if the Template was run directly (not as the result of opening a file).+ Can right-click on the Variables tab and select *Clear* to clear the results from a Script or Template.+ The InputString function now returns a UTF-8 string.+ Jump to Template Variable is now only shown on the Editor right-click menu when editing a hex file.* **Editor**                       + In the Text Editor, line numbers are now hidden by default and can be displayed by clicking '*View > Addresses > Show Addresses*'.+ When addresses are hidden, place the mouse cursor over the address column for a second to see the line number in a hint popup.+ When addresses are hidden, a triangle marker indicates the last line in a file (this can be turned off by setting the *Address End Marker* to None in the Theme/Colors Options dialog).+ When addresses are hidden, a '-' marker indicates lines that are created by word-wrap.+ In the Text Editor, ruler labels are now hidden by default and can be shown using '*View > Ruler > Show Labels*'.+ When ruler labels are hidden, place the mouse cursor over the ruler for a second to view the mouse and cursor position in a hint popup.+ In the Hex Editor, small arrows in the ruler show the current cursor position and can be turned off using '*View > Ruler > Show Arrows*'.+ '*View > Tabs/Whitespace > Show Whitespace*' now can be used to visualize linefeed types for each line.+ The different symbols drawn for *Show Whitespace* can be configured using the *Text Editor* page of the Options dialog.+ Breakpoints can be toggled by clicking the left-most column when editing a Script or Template.+ When right-clicking on the editor, the cursor is now moved before the right-click menu is shown.* **General**                         + The shortcut for opening the Base Converter was changed to Ctrl+F11.+ Updated the visual style of the Windows installer.+ Using *Import Hex* with Hex Text or *Paste from Hex Text* now supports data with more types of formatting.* **Options**                           + On the Text Editor page added the *Show Whitespace* section to control how linefeeds are drawn.+ On the Text Editor page added the *Change Whitespace Symbols* button to control which symbols are drawn for the different types of whitespace.+ On the Theme/Colors page added an option to control colors of breakpoints and the debug active line.+ On the Theme/Colors page added an option to control colors of the Address Hover Marker and Address End Marker (a triangle marker displayed on the last line when Show Addresses is turned off).+ On the Compiling page added the *Configure* button to control which warnings are displayed in the Output panel.+ On the Compiling page added the *Breakpoints are Persistent* toggle to control whether breakpoints are automatically saved to disk.+ On the Compiling page added the *Show Variable Hints when Debugging* option to display the value of variables when the mouse is placed over a variable name in the Text Editor.+ On the Compiling page added the *When errors occur* drop-down menu to control what action is taken when an error occurs in a Script or Template.+ On the Inspector page added the default date format 'dd/MM/yyyy'.* **Bugs**                             + Fixed scripts were not given permission to execute functions in DLLs in some cases.+ Fixed incorrect error message 'Incorrect function' when trying to load a file that does not exist on some machines.+ Fixed a crash replacing certain empty regular expressions with nothing.+ Fixed a possible crash editing a text file which contains a very long line (as reported by Kexu Wang of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs).+ Fixed incorrect size of tabs in the Preferences dialog of the Help application.+ Fixed Save All does not try to save text in the Calculator to a file.+ Fixed the Inspector would sometimes not update properly after clicking a Floating Tab Group file and then a Template Results panel in the main window.+ Fixed possible crash with the Memset function (as reported by Kexu Wang of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs).+ Fixed possible crash with ReadWLine/ReadLine/ReadWString/ReadString functions and very large files (as reported by Kexu Wang of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs).+ Fixed '*Format > Comment Selection*' now works with Python commenting.+ Fixed permission issue with the FileSaveRange function.+ Fixed up some inaccurate error messages when using invalid name/comment functions.+ Fixed a text color issue with the Output pane after calling the OutputPaneClear function.+ Fixed when replacing with nothing, sometimes not all replacements were listed in the Replace Results when 2 or more occurrences were found together.+ Fixed an empty struct could be executed twice in some cases.  |  | | --- |   Version 9.0.2 - April 26th, 2019  * Fixed icon transparency for the Windows Explorer shell extension.* Fixed syntax highlighting for keywords (HighlightMatchKeyword) now finds the longest matching keyword instead of the shortest (e.g. 'background-repeat' vs 'background').* Fixed when 010 Editor is run as administrator on Windows, files could no longer be opened from the Windows Explorer shell extension. Now a new non-admin copy of 010 Editor is opened before the files are opened.* Fixed on Linux the IBus IME can now be used.* Fixed possible crash in Memcpy, StrCat and SubStr when using very large arrays.* Fixed possible memory overrun when downloading news.* Fixed when opening a text file from the command line containing a BOM, sometimes bytes were improperly selected at the beginning of the file.  |  | | --- |   Version 9.0.1 - December 5th, 2018  * Fixed a number of cases when a Syntax Highlighter was not properly applied when a file was opened.* Fixed an error running a Syntax Highlighter when the first line of a file was blank.* Fixed using 'return' inside a struct which was declared in a function would cause an error in the function.* Fixed bookmarks created while the Bookmarks panel was hidden were not properly shown when the Boomkarks panel was displayed.* Fixed on Linux when using a dark theme, the category headings in the Repository dialog could not be read.* Fixed the 'Hide Characters over 127' toggle should always be turned off when a custom character set is created.* Fixed passing a very long line to a Syntax Highlighter could cause the software to slow down. Syntax Highlighters now only color up to the Maximum Line Length as set in the Text Editor Options.* Fixed a problem running a template on a template, or a script on a script using the File Bar (right-click on the File Bar to enable this).* Fixed the Sleep function on Linux/macOS was using microseconds instead of milliseconds.* Fixed the Variables tab was not always showing the results after running a script.* Added a warning when a very long line was encountered (over 100,000 bytes) and word wrap was turned on. These lines cannot currently be fully wrapped and this will be improved in the future.  |  | | --- |   Version 9.0 - October 10th, 2018 The following is an overview of the new functionality in version 9.0 of 010 Editor:   * Syntax Highlighters can now be shared via our online template repository.* Syntax Highlighters are implemented as a function inside a Binary Template .bt file.* Syntax Highlighters can be run by clicking the *Syntax:* section in the File Bar just above each text editor or by clicking '*Templates > Syntax*' on the main menu.* Added a number of new character sets and simple character sets can be customized, imported, or exported.* Scripts and Templates can now call functions in an external library (\*.dll on Windows, \*.so on Linux, \*.dylib on macOS) using #link.* Now the last cursor position and scroll position for files are restored when 010 Editor is restarted.* Added Delete Line (Ctrl+Shift+Backspace) and Delete Blank Lines commands to the Format menu.* Triple-click to select by line and drag to select multiple lines.   The following is a list of all new features in version 9.0 of 010 Editor:   * **Syntax Highlighting**   + Syntax Highlighters can now be shared via our online template .+ Syntax Highlighters are written in a different format than before and are implemented as a function inside a Binary Template bt file.+ New Binary Templates XML.bt, CPP.bt, PHP.bt and HTML.bt are automatically installed to perform syntax highlighting for those formats and other Binary Templates will be added to the online repository soon.+ Highlighting for 010 Editor Templates and Scripts is now performed with the 010.bt Binary Template.+ Removed the '*View > Highlighting > Syntax Highlighting*' menu.+ Syntax Highlighters are now run by clicking the *Syntax:* section in the File Bar just above each text editor or by clicking '*Templates > Syntax*' on the main menu.+ Clear Syntax Highlighters from a file by clicking on the *Syntax:* section in the File Bar above a text editor and select '*(none)*'.+ If a Syntax Highlighter is found in the repository to highlight the current file, a dialog will popup asking to install or ignore the file, similar to installing regular Binary Templates.+ The *Syntax* page has been removed from the Options dialog.+ When 010 Editor v9 is first run, any old custom Syntax Highlighters created with the *Syntax* page of the Options dialog are exported to XML files in the 'Documents\SweetScape\Old Syntax Highlighters' directory.+ Old Syntax Highlighters must be converted manually to the new format and there is not yet an automated tool to do the conversion.+ The new Syntax Highlighting method can handle a huge range of other text formats but requires some programming to implement.+ SweetScape Software will be available to help with conversion of Syntax Highlighters for common text formats time permitting.+ If Old Syntax Highlighters were exported, they can be exported again later by clicking the *Export Old Syntax Highlighter* button on the *Highlights* page of the Options dialog. If this button is not displayed then there are no Syntax Highlighters to export.+ Syntax Highlighters are written by implementing the function HighlightLineRealtime inside a Binary Template. This function applies colors to a single line of text.+ Highlighting can also be applied to binary files instead of text files by implementing the function HighlightBytesRealtime in a Binary Template.+ Added new functions to help in the creation of Syntax Highlighters: HighlightFindStyle, HighlightGetStyleForeColor, HighlightGetStyleBackColor, HighlightAllowInstanceSharing, HighlightApplyStyle, HighlightApplyColor, HighlightGetNextToken, HighlightBuildKeywordList, HighlightMatchKeyword, HighlightMatchString, HighlightFindKeyword, HighlightFindString, HighlightCheckMultiLineRule, HighlightCheckCommentRule, HighlightCheckSingleLineRule, HighlightCheckKeywordRule, HighlightCheckTagRule, HighlightCheckTagTokenRule, HighlightColorPattern.+ Some highlighting functions can do case insensitive matching by using the HIGHLIGHT\_IGNORECASE constant.+ Some highlighting functions can do regular expression matching by using the HIGHLIGHT\_REGEX constant.+ The HighlightFindStyle function has an option to create custom Syntax Styles if they do not yet exist.+ Custom Syntax Styles now store separate colors for light and dark themes.+ If instance sharing is turned on using the HighlightAllowInstanceSharing function then only one copy of the Syntax Highlighter is kept in memory and used for all open files of the target text format.+ By default the Template Results panel is not shown when running a Binary Template that does syntax highlighting.* **File Interfaces**     + Syntax Highlighting is no longer controlled via the current File Interface (*View > Edit As*).+ Combined the old file interfaces *XML* and *HTML* into a single *Tagged* interface.+ Combined the old file interfaces *C/C++* and *PHP* into a single *Code* interface.+ '*File > New*' menu now controlled by clicking *Manage New File Types...* on the *Editor* page of the Options dialog.+ Possible to show or hide different sections (e.g. Run Script, Run Template, Repository...) of the File Bar above each text or hex editor by right-clicking on the File Bar.* **Character Sets**       + Added support for more character sets as well as custom character sets.+ The '*View > Character Set*' menu has been reorganized to show a list of common character sets, followed by a list of recently used characters, followed by the character sets sorted into Standard, International, and Custom categories.+ Character sets can be viewed, customized, imported and exported using the new *Character Sets* page of the Options dialog.+ Now per-file character sets can be set by turning off the '*View > Character Set > Use Default' toggle*. If the *Use Default* toggle is on then the character set comes from the current File Interface.+ When opening a file and a different character set is detected than the current File Interface has, the *Use Default* toggle will be turned off automatically (an example of this is opening a Unicode XML file).+ If a different character set is chosen when the *Use Default* toggle is off, that character set will be remembered when the file is closed and opened again.+ Added the following character sets:                     - Arabic (ISO) - ISO 8859-6- Baltic (ISO) - ISO 8859-13- Cyrillic (KOI8-R) - KOI8-R- Cyrillic (KOI8-U) - KOI8-U- Cyrillic (ISO) - ISO 8859-5- Eastern Europe (ISO) - ISO 8859-2- Greek (ISO) - ISO 8859-7- Hebrew (ISO) - ISO 8859-8- Japanese (EUC-JP) - EUC-JP- Japanese (ISO-2022-JP) - ISO 2022-JP- Turkish (ISO) - ISO 8859-9+ Existing character sets Arabic, Baltic, Cyrillic, Eastern Europe, Greek, and Hebrew now have "(Windows)" appended to their name to show they are using the Windows code pages.+ Japanese character set is now named 'Japanese (Shift\_JIS)'.+ Now just a single Korean character set EUC-KR is supported.+ The *Character Sets* page of the Options dialog allows viewing character sets and creating custom character sets.+ Character sets are displayed in a 16x16 table for easy visualization.+ Information about different symbols is displayed in a tool tip when moving the mouse cursor over the character set table.+ When viewing a complex (multi-byte) character set a horizontal scroll bar will appear to allow scrolling through the different pages.+ The font of the character set table can be controlled by right-clicking on the table.+ Simple character sets can be modified by clicking on a symbol in the character set table and selecting a different symbol using the Change Symbol dialog that pops up.+ If attempting to modify a built-in characters set, the character set will be copied to a new custom character set before the modification is made.+ Simple character sets can be exporting to a CSV file by clicking on the *Export...* button.+ A simple character set can be imported by clicking the *Import...* button. The import format should be 256 numbers separated by commas, spaces, or tabs and the number -1 designates no change.+ In the Change Symbol dialog click the *Reset* button to reset the character to the original value or enter a new Unicode code point U+XXXX in the edit field at the top right corner.+ In the *Character Sets* page of the Options dialog enable the *Show at Top Level* toggle to display the character set at the top of the '*View > Character Sets*' menu.+ For custom character sets, the *Encoding* can be chosen to select which internal encoding this character set uses to convert bytes to characters.+ Enable the *Hide Characters over 127* toggle to hide the display of any character with Unicode code points over 127 (for example, this is used for the ASCII character set).+ The text displayed in the status bar when a character set is active can be controlled using the *Status Bar Indicator* edit box.+ An integer *ID Number* can be specified for custom character sets for use in scripting functions such as ConvertString.+ New constants are available for the ConvertString function for the newly available build-in character sets.+ Created character sets are available for conversion when using the '*Tools > Convert...*' tool.+ The Convert tool shows the character sets marked as *Show at Top Level* and recently used character sets at the top of the *Target Character Set* list.+ After the Convert tool is run, the file may be assigned a per-file character set (i.e. the '*View > Character Set > Use Default*' toggle is turned off and a different character set is assigned).* **External Functions in DLLs**         + Templates and Scripts can now call functions in an external dynamic library.+ Works with Windows DLLs (\*.dll), Linux shared objects (\*.so), or macOS DYLIB files (\*.dylib).+ All functions defined inside of a #link "<filename>" and #endlink directive are assumed to be located in an external library (note that no body can be defined for these functions).+ The 32-bit version of 010 Editor should be used when linking to 32-bit external libraries and the 64-bit version of 010 Editor should be used when linking to 64-bit external libraries.+ Supports passing regular integer variables, floats and doubles and arrays of these types to external functions.+ Support passing strings or wstrings to external functions.+ Supports return types of any regular integer variables, float, double, string or wstring.+ Use & to pass variables as references (pointers are not currently allowed in scripts and templates).+ Structs cannot currently be passed to external functions.+ Templates must be granted *ExecuteDLL* permission before being allowed to call functions in an external library. See the *Permissions* page of the Options dialog.* **Templates and Scripts**           + Templates and Scripts can now use functions in an external library (see External Functions in DLLs above).+ Added support for time64\_t including new functions StringToTime64T and Time64TToString.+ The ImportFile function can now import Motorola with word-based addressing.+ The default character set for Templates and Scripts for new installs of 010 Editor is now UTF-8 (the character set of existing installations of 010 Editor is not changed).+ Syntax Highlighting is now done through Binary Templates.+ Implement the HighlightLineRealtime function in a Template to provide syntax highlighting for a text file, or HighlightBytesRealtime function to provide highlighting for a binary file.+ Added a variety of HighlightXXX functions to help with writing syntax highlighters.+ Added new functions for testing the type of different characters: IsCharAlpha, IsCharAlphaW, IsCharNum, IsCharNumW, IsCharAlphaNum, IsCharAlphaNumW, IsCharSymbol, IsCharSymbolW, IsCharWhitespace, IsCharWhitespaceW.* **General**             + Now the last cursor position and scroll position for files are restored when 010 Editor is restarted (this can be turned off using the Editor page of the Options dialog).+ Added '*Format > Delete Line*' command (Ctrl+Shift+Backspace shortcut by default).+ Added Ctrl+Shift+N shortcut key to create a Hex file.+ Triple-click the mouse to select a whole line in the text or hex editor.+ Triple-click the mouse and drag to select by lines.+ Added the '*Format > Delete Blank Lines*' command to delete empty lines in a file or selection.+ Added '*Format > Delete Left Word/Delete Right Word*' to the format menu with shortcuts Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Del.+ Can export Motorola S19/S28/S37 hex data using word-based addressing (added *Motorola Hex Address Format* toggle to the Export Hex dialog).+ Can import Motorola S19/S28/S37 hex data using word-based addressing (added *Motorola Hex Address Format* toggle to the Importing section of the Options dialog).+ Added new 64-bit type time64\_t to the Inspector (the new type has also been added to the Inspector.bt file).+ Hid Unicode line in the Inspector as it could cause rare crashes when browsing large binary files. This can be re-enabled by choosing *Use Custom Inspector* in the Inspector Options and then editing the Inspector.bt file.* **Options**               + Add new *Character Sets* page for organizing and customizing character sets.+ Remove *Syntax* page as Syntax Highlighting is now done through Binary Templates.+ Added *Export Old Syntax Highlighter* button on the *Highlights* page if old custom syntax highlighters are found.+ On the Editor page added *Show Startup Page when All Files are Closed* toggle.+ On the Editor page added *Remember Last Cursor Position* toggle.+ '*File > New*' menu is now controlled by clicking *Manage New File Types...* on the *Editor* page of the Options dialog.+ Added *ExecuteDLL* permission to the *Permissions* page to allow Templates to execute functions in an external library.+ On the Importing page added *Motorola Hex Address Format* radio buttons.* **macOS**                 + Fixed a problem on macOS opening files from the command line that contain spaces.+ Fixed a problem using the Esc key to cancel certain operations on macOS.+ Fixed a problem with the hex editor Auto-line width calculation on macOS.+ Fixed an issue with the version number display in the macOS Finder on some versions of macOS.+ Fixed on macOS the undo stack was being lost after saving a file in some cases.* **Bugs**                   + Fixed preprocessor symbol expansion was improperly expanding constants inside strings.+ Fixed the Input Method Editor (IME) was not being displayed properly after certain operations.+ Fixed a problem using the color picker in the Custom Colors section of the Find Bar Options dialog.+ Fixed opening a file when a different character set is detected than is assigned in the current File Interface, then that file is assigned a per-file character set (for example if opening a Unicode XML file).+ Fixed a crash with Copy As Text Area operation in certain cases.+ Fixed an issue with the Portable version loading files from the command line when the application was already open.+ Fixed an issue displaying non-printable characters in the text editor on some machines.+ Fixed newly created Tool Bars where not being themed properly.+ Fixed a crash assigning to structs in certain cases (should generate an error instead of crashing).+ Fixing pressing Backspace when a selection was made and the cursor was at the beginning of the file was not deleting the selection.+ Fixed clicking 'View > Template Results' may not properly show a hidden Template Results panel when moved to the right side.+ Fixed an issue using Ctrl+C to copy text from the Output panel when text was selected in the main editor window.+ Fixed name and password are now being encoded before being sent to our online server for license checks.+ Fixed a problem using the FindAll and ReplaceAll functions using UTF-8.+ Fixed in the Template Repository, clicking the View button does not properly focus the displayed file.+ Fixed the Inspector when using a custom Template was not updating properly after FileNew was called in a script.+ Fixed using unpadded bitfields could result in a zero sized variable in some cases.+ Fixed a problem loading a custom theme that was imported.+ Fixed a bug on Linux with unreadable white text in the help file when using a dark OS theme.+ Fixed Copy Table command in the Checksum Results panel was only copying one column.+ Fixed Copy as Rich Text Format now creates background colors in a format compatible with WordPad.  |  | | --- |   Version 8.0.1 -
