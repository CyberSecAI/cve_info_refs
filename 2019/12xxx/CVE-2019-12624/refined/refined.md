Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections in the web-based management interface of Cisco IOS XE New Generation Wireless Controller (NGWC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability in the web interface.
- Lack of adequate checks to verify the origin of requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker could perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.
- The attacker can execute commands with the privileges of the user who is tricked into clicking the crafted link/request.
- Potential for complete compromise of the affected device (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability all rated as High impact).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:N).
- Exploitation requires user interaction (UI:R) â€“ specifically, the user needs to be persuaded to click a crafted link.
- The attack is unauthenticated (PR:N), meaning the attacker doesn't need any prior access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious link.
- The attacker needs to persuade a user of the web interface to follow the crafted link.
- The attacker does not need to have any special privileges or authentication to the system.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco 5760 Wireless LAN Controllers, Catalyst 3650 Series Switches, Catalyst 3850 Series Switches, and Catalyst 4500E Supervisor Engine 8-E (Wireless) Switches, when running any of the 3.xE releases of Cisco IOS XE Software.
