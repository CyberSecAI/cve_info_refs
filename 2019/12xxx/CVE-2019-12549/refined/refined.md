```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the use of hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon within the WAGO devices.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Hardcoded private keys for the SSH daemon.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the affected devices via SSH using the hardcoded private key, leading to full compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote network access via SSH.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the device to establish an SSH connection. They would also need to know or obtain the hardcoded private key.",
    "Additional Information": "The fingerprint of the SSH host key from the corresponding SSH daemon matches the embedded private key. This detail helps an attacker confirm they have the correct key."
