Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12472:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the MediaWiki API's `action=block` functionality not properly enforcing the `$wgBlockCIDRLimit` configuration setting. This setting is meant to limit the size of IP ranges that can be blocked, preventing overly broad blocks.
- A code change in 2011 moved the validation out of `SpecialBlock::processForm()` which resulted in the API block action bypassing the configured limits.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Bypass of configured limits:** The primary weakness is that the API allowed blocking IP ranges larger than what was defined by `$wgBlockCIDRLimit`, such as /1 or /2 blocks.
- **Lack of input validation:** Specifically in the API `action=block`, there was a lack of proper validation against `$wgBlockCIDRLimit`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could block extremely large ranges of IP addresses, effectively denying access to a significant portion of users.
- **Disruption of Service:** This broad blocking could disrupt normal website operation.
- **Abuse by malicious actors:** Malicious users, or automated bots with admin privileges, could misuse this to disrupt the MediaWiki instance.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Abuse:** The vulnerability was exploited through the MediaWiki API, specifically using the `action=block` parameter.
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker would require a MediaWiki account with the necessary privileges to use the `action=block` API function (e.g., admin or bot account).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **MediaWiki account:** The attacker needs a user account with permissions to use the block API call.
- **Knowledge of the MediaWiki API:**  The attacker would need knowledge of how to use the `action=block` API.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in multiple versions of MediaWiki and has been patched in versions 1.27.6, 1.30.2, 1.31.2, 1.32.2, and newer.
- The fix was implemented by ensuring that the `action=block` API call now respects the `$wgBlockCIDRLimit` setting.
- The issue was discovered when an adminbot on ruwikiquote was observed blocking large IP ranges.
