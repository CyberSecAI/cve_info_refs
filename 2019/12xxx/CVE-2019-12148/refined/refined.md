{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Sangoma SBC web application passes user-supplied input (username) as arguments to the `sng-user-mgmt` script without proper sanitization. The `escapeshellcmd` function is used to prevent shell injection, but it does not prevent argument injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Argument Injection (CWE-88)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated user can bypass the login process and gain complete access to the application, including the ability to create new privileged users.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a crafted username containing arguments to the `sng-user-mgmt` script, an attacker can manipulate the execution of the script to return a successful exit code, which bypasses authentication logic.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have network access to the Sangoma SBC web application login page and be able to submit HTTP requests with modified usernames."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered because the `/usr/local/sng/bin/sng-user-mgmt` script returns an exit code of 0 even when it receives the `-h` argument (help menu). The web application incorrectly interprets this exit code as successful authentication and establishes a user session.",
