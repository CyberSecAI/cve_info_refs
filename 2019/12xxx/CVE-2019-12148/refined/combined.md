# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

# Sangoma SBC bypass authentication via argument injection - CVE-2019-12148

---

*From*: Security Team Appsecco via Fulldisclosure <fulldisclosure () seclists org>

*Date*: Thu, 17 Oct 2019 13:17:00 +0000

```
## Introduction

### Description

A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists in the 2.3.23-119-GA version of Sangoma SBC that would allow an
unauthenticated user to bypass authentication and login as a non-existen user but with complete access to the dashboard
including additional privileged user creation capabilities.

### Vulnerability Type

- Argument Injection or Modification (<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html>)

## Product Overview

A Sangoma SBC protects both your data and voice network and is designed to handle every aspect of phone calls that
travel over the internet (or voice-over-ip phone calls).

## Background

The Sangoma SBC web application heavily relies on the python script `/usr/local/sng/bin/sng-user-mgmt` for various user
operations including authenticating the user that is supplied on the login screen of the web application.

When a username and password is provided to the application, it is processed by `/var/webconfig/gui/Webconfig.inc.php`
which uses the `Execute` function from `/var/webconfig/api/ShellExec.class.php` to pass the credentials to
`/usr/local/sng/bin/sng-user-mgmt` as arguments. The `Execute` function applies the `escapeshellcmd` function to
convert any shell characters as literals, however there is no verification that the variables passed do not contain
strings that can be interpreted as additional arguments to `/usr/local/sng/bin/sng-user-mgmt`.

The `/var/webconfig/gui/Webconfig.inc.php` calls the `WebSetSessionAuthenticated()` function if the return value of the
`$shell->Execute($cmd, $args, true, array('log','escape'=>true))` is 0 as shown below.

```
$rc = $shell->Execute($cmd, $args, true, array('log','escape'=>true));
if(0 == $rc){
    ...
    ...
    WebSetSessionAuthenticated();
}else{
    Logger::SysLog("webconfig", "login - ${username} login failed");
    ...
    ...
}
```

The Operating System returns a 0 if the `/usr/local/sng/bin/sng-user-mgmt` program exits successfully.

This is true for all arguments of the program unless an explicit status code is sent back to the Operating System.
Invoking the help menu, for example is also a successful execution of the program as can be seen from the below two
commands

```
# /usr/local/sng/bin/sng-user-mgmt -h
Usage: sng-user-mgmt [options] arg

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ACTION, --action=ACTION
                        Action to perform.
  -u USER, --user=USER  User Name
  -s, --syslog          Log to syslog
  -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                        Password
  -f FORCE, --force=FORCE
                        Force to remove a user
  -n NAME, --name=NAME  User Name
  -e ENCRYPTEDPASSWORD, --encrypted-password=ENCRYPTEDPASSWORD
                        Encrypted Password
  -d HASHEDPASSWORD, --hashed-password=HASHEDPASSWORD
                        Hashed Password
  -l ACCESS, --access=ACCESS
                        Toggle user login access, ie. Enable / Disable
  -o, --sudoer          Add to sudoer list
root@sangoma-test ~
# echo $?
0
```

As the status code is 0, the check in `/var/webconfig/gui/Webconfig.inc.php` passes and a new user session is created.

Passing additional arguments through the username field that would cause the `sng-user-mgmt` to return a 0 would result
in a session being created without any valid credentials being supplied. This session provides complete access to the
application, including the ability to create additional sudo privilged users.

## Proof of Concept Exploit

1. Pass a username with the value `adam -h`
2. The password field can be set to anything as this will be ignored
3. Click login
4. The `-h` invokes the help menu for `sng-user-mgmt`, returning a 0 and causing `Webconfig.inc.php` to create a new
session.
5. You are now logged in

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
