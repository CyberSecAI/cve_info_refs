The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Anviz biometric devices and their management software. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-2019-12394:

**CVE-2019-12394:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Anviz devices do not require any password for various operations, including changing the administrator password. The devices fail to implement proper authentication mechanisms.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of authentication, specifically the absence of a password check when changing settings like the administrator password.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can change the administrator password without knowing the current password. This leads to unauthorized access and control over the device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network access to the device using the proprietary protocol.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Must be able to send commands to the device on the network, using the proprietary protocol (TCP port 5010).
    *   No prior authentication is required.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE description):**

*   The article provides significant context around the protocol's vulnerabilities, its lack of encryption, and its susceptibility to replay attacks.
*   It details the reverse engineering process used to understand the protocol, which uses a custom CRC16 checksum.
*   The research demonstrates that an attacker can access and modify sensitive data (cleartext passwords/pins, RFID tag data, names, and other personal parameters), not just the administrator password, and this is covered by CVE-2019-12390/CVE-2019-12389/CVE-2019-12388.
*   The article highlights that Anviz recommends exposing the device directly to the internet, exacerbating the security risks.
*   The research also found a buffer overflow vulnerability in the management software (CVE-2019-12518) and a vulnerability in the update mechanism (CVE-2020-19594) that could lead to remote code execution.

In summary, the content confirms that CVE-2019-12394 is related to the lack of authentication on the Anviz devices allowing password changes without any checks, and provides significant details about the root cause, impact, and attack vectors.
