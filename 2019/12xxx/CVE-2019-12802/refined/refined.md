  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-12802",
    "description": "radare2: denial of service in function rcc_context in /libr/egg/egg_lang.c",
    "affected_component": "radare2",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of boundary check when changing context in the `rcc_context` function within `/libr/egg/egg_lang.c`. Specifically, the context variable `CTX` can be manipulated with a `delta`, leading to out-of-bounds access. When CTX is at its maximum (31) and delta is 1, or when CTX is at its minimum (0) and delta is -1, CTX will go out of bounds.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service",
      "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
   "impact": "The out-of-bounds access can lead to a crash, causing a denial of service. In some instances, this may also trigger invalid memory frees.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a specific input file using `ragg2` to manipulate `CTX` in the `rcc_context` function within `/libr/egg/egg_lang.c` and trigger an out-of-bounds access.",
       "This can be triggered by parsing a crafted input file to ragg2"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to `ragg2`, which is part of the radare2 framework."
