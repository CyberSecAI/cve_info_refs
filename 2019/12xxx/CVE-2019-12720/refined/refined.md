- **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
- **Root cause:** The AUO SunVeillance Monitoring System versions prior to 1.1.9e are vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient input validation. Specifically, the `MailAdd` parameter in `mvc_send_mail.aspx` is vulnerable. Additionally, the parameters `plant_no` in `picture_manage_mvc.aspx` and `swapdl_mvc.aspx`, and `Text_Postal_Code` and `Text_Dis_Code` in `account_management.aspx` are also vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Attack vector:** By crafting malicious SQL queries through the vulnerable parameters.
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL commands to the server, allowing them to read privileged data.
- **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable pages and modify the vulnerable parameters with malicious SQL code. The `mvc_send_mail.aspx` page is accessible without authentication.
