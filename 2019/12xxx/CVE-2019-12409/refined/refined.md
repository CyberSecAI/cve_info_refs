{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an insecure default configuration in Apache Solr versions 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 where the JMX service is enabled and configured for remote access without authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS=\"true\"` setting in `solr.in.sh` enables the JMX service.",
      "The `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false` setting in `solr.cmd` allows remote access to JMX.",
      "The `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false` setting disables authentication for JMX access."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the server running Apache Solr.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks targeting the exposed JMX port (typically 18983).",
       "The attacker uses the exposed JMX service to load and execute malicious code.",
      "Metasploit module or tools like `mjet` can be used to exploit the vulnerability."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
        "Attacker needs network access to the exposed JMX port.",
        "Attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted JMX requests."
