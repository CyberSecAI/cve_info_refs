Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-12749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the implementation of the `DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1` authentication mechanism within the `dbus` library. The core issue is that the implementation is susceptible to a symbolic link attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Authentication bypass:** A local attacker can manipulate symbolic links in their own home directory (specifically the `~/.dbus-keyrings` symlink) to redirect the `DBusServer` to read and write in unintended locations.
* **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** The `DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1` mechanism doesn't properly handle symbolic links, allowing an attacker to force the `DBusServer` to use attacker-controlled files for authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Privilege escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and connect to a `DBusServer` with elevated privileges.
* **Data confidentiality and integrity:** The attacker can potentially cause the `DBusServer` to read or write in unintended locations, leading to disclosure of sensitive data and/or alteration of data.
* **System availability**: Attackers can impact system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack**: The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Symbolic Link Manipulation**: The attack is carried out by manipulating symbolic links within the attacker's home directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account**: The attacker requires a local user account with write access to their home directory.
*   **Ability to create symbolic links**: The attacker must have the capability to create and modify symbolic links in their own home directory.
*   **No Remote Attack**: This vulnerability is not remotely exploitable under normal configurations

**Additional Details:**

*   The standard system and session `dbus-daemon` in default configurations are usually **not affected** because they only accept the `EXTERNAL` authentication mechanism, rejecting `DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1` early on.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects third-party users of `DBusServer` that utilize the `DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1` authentication.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is affected and can achieve privilege escalation through upstart.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 are affected only in non-standard configurations.
* Mitigation for supported branches includes disabling the `DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1` mechanism by forcing the use of `EXTERNAL` authentication only

**Affected versions (as per security.gentoo.org):**
*   `dbus` versions prior to 1.10.28, 1.12.x prior to 1.12.16, and 1.13.x prior to 1.13.12

**Unaffected versions (as per security.gentoo.org):**
*   `dbus` versions 1.10.28 and later, 1.12.16 and later, and 1.13.12 and later

The provided information includes a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, its impact, and affected versions. The documents also include information on how to mitigate the vulnerability by upgrading affected packages and/or applying upstream patches. Several documents also indicate that while the vulnerability is present, it does not affect default configurations for some of the affected software, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora. However, the vulnerability can be triggered in non-standard configurations, requiring users to update their systems to mitigate the issue.
