- System Compromise: The ability to execute commands can lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attack can be carried out remotely.
- WebUI: The vulnerable component is the WebUI of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage solution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Attacker: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the WebUI.
- Malicious Input: The attacker must configure a malicious username on the login page which is then not properly validated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco SD-WAN vManage releases earlier than 18.3.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- Fixed releases include Cisco SD-WAN vManage 18.3.0 and later.
