Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `miniupnpd` daemon's improper validation of callback addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The daemon fails to adequately validate callback addresses, which are likely used in UPnP event notification. This lack of validation opens a path for attackers to provide malicious callback URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** A remote attacker could exploit this issue to potentially expose sensitive information. While the specific nature of leaked data isn't detailed in these sources, it suggests that the attacker might be able to redirect or intercept callback data, leading to unauthorized access to information intended for other systems/users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:**  A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Callback Address:** The attacker sends requests containing crafted callback addresses, likely as part of UPnP subscription requests or event notifications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the `miniupnpd` service, possibly from the same network or via a reachable interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft or manipulate UPnP requests or events to include a malicious callback address.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided `github.com` content shows a commit that addresses a related issue in the `upnp_event_prepare()` function, where the return value of `snprintf()` was not checked. This doesn't directly relate to the callback validation issue described for CVE-2019-12107, however the `upnp_event_prepare` function is involved in preparing upnp event messages to be sent to subscribers, which may involve handling the callback address indirectly.
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4542-1) explicitly mentions the improper validation of callback addresses as the vulnerability for CVE-2019-12107.
- The Debian LTS advisory and the Ubuntu package changelog both indicate that this CVE is addressed by applying upstream patches.

In summary, CVE-2019-12107 in `miniupnpd` arises from a lack of proper validation of callback addresses. A remote attacker could leverage this to potentially leak sensitive information by directing callback data to attacker-controlled destinations.
