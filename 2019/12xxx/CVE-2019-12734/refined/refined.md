      ],
      "impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary code as root on the target server.",
      "attack_vectors": [

		"Leveraging the injected script module to execute arbitrary code via Java APIs"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a low-privilege account, such as an Editor user, on the SiteVision platform.",
	   "additional_info": "The vulnerability is triggered by resending an HTTP request, modifying the `portletType` parameter to `script`, and then adding malicious JavaScript code."
