## Relevant content from the provided documents regarding CVE-2019-12781:

Here's a breakdown of the information extracted from the provided texts, focusing on CVE-2019-12781:

**Description of the Vulnerability:**

*   **Incorrect HTTP detection:** When Django is deployed behind a reverse proxy that connects to it via HTTPS, the `django.http.HttpRequest.scheme` attribute incorrectly detects client requests made via HTTP as using HTTPS.
*   **Impact:** This leads to incorrect results for `is_secure()` and `build_absolute_uri()`. Also HTTP requests are not correctly redirected to HTTPS in accordance with `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Django master development branch
*   Django 2.2 before version 2.2.3
*   Django 2.1 before version 2.1.10
*   Django 1.11 before version 1.11.22

**Root Cause:**

*   The `HttpRequest.scheme` was not correctly detecting the scheme of the client request (HTTP vs HTTPS) when a reverse proxy was used.

**Resolution:**

*   The fix involves making `HttpRequest.scheme` respect the `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` setting.  If configured, it checks the appropriate header to determine the scheme, handling both HTTP and HTTPS requests correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Disclosure of sensitive information.
*   Incorrect results from scheme, `is_secure()`, `build_absolute_uri()`.
*   Failure to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS when `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` is enabled.

**Attack Vector:**

*   A client makes an HTTP request to a Django application deployed behind a reverse proxy that connects to Django via HTTPS.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Django application that is behind a reverse proxy.

**Affected NetApp Products:**

*   According to one of the NetApp documents, *none* of their products were affected. However, this advisory notes that multiple NetApp products incorporate Django, and exploiting the vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.

**Specific vulnerable code:**

*   `django.http.HttpRequest.scheme`

**Red Hat's view**

*   Red Hat states that their python-django packages shipped with Red Hat Update Infrastructure for Cloud Providers are not affected because the load balancer should not be configured to forward HTTP requests.

**Fix versions:**

*   Django 1.11.22
*   Django 2.1.10
*   Django 2.2.3
