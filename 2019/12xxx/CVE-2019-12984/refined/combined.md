CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207
                 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233
                 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-20836

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel
    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be
    exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

    It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively
    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the
    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when
    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,
    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using
    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an
    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-1999

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  If this driver is loaded, a
    local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-10207

    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with
    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this
    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash".  This could enable
    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
    remote servers and from different networks.  The "siphash"
    function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-12817

    It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the
    hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a
    process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB.  This could
    lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of
    memory between user processes.  A local user could use this for
    privilege escalation.  Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom
    kernel with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected.

CVE-2019-12984

    It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not
    properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user on a system with an
    NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-13233

    Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture,
    in use of the LDT.  This could lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service.

CVE-2019-13631

    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially
    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-13648

    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without
    Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to
    restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call.  A local
    user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

CVE-2019-14283

    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a
    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the
    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the
    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk
    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207
                 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-20836

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel
    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be
    exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

    It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively
    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the
    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when
    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,
    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using
    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an
    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-1999

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  If this driver is loaded, a
    local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-10207

    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with
    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this
    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash".  This could enable
    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
    remote servers and from different networks.  The "siphash"
    function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-12817

    It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the
    hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a
    process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB.  This could
    lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of
    memory between user processes.  A local user could use this for
    privilege escalation.  Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom
    kernel with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected.

CVE-2019-12984

    It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not
    properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user on a system with an
    NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-13233

    Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture,
    in use of the LDT.  This could lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service.

CVE-2019-13631

    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially
    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-13648

    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without
    Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to
    restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call.  A local
    user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

CVE-2019-14283

    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a
    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the
    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the
    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk
    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not

sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking

protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux

devices. ([CVE-2019-10638](/security/CVE-2019-10638))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14283](/security/CVE-2019-14283))

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14284](/security/CVE-2019-14284))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the

virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.

([CVE-2019-3900](/security/CVE-2019-3900))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 19.04

* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [5.0.0.1014.15](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/5.0.0-1014.16)
* [linux-image-5.0.0-1014-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [5.0.0-1014.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/5.0.0-1014.16)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

coredump: fix race condition between collapse\_huge\_page() and core dumping
commit 59ea6d06cfa9247b586a695c21f94afa7183af74 upstream.
When fixing the race conditions between the coredump and the mmap\_sem
holders outside the context of the process, we focused on
mmget\_not\_zero()/get\_task\_mm() callers in 04f5866e41fb70 ("coredump: fix
race condition between mmget\_not\_zero()/get\_task\_mm() and core
dumping"), but those aren't the only cases where the mmap\_sem can be
taken outside of the context of the process as Michal Hocko noticed
while backporting that commit to older -stable kernels.
If mmgrab() is called in the context of the process, but then the
mm\_count reference is transferred outside the context of the process,
that can also be a problem if the mmap\_sem has to be taken for writing
through that mm\_count reference.
khugepaged registration calls mmgrab() in the context of the process,
but the mmap\_sem for writing is taken later in the context of the
khugepaged kernel thread.
collapse\_huge\_page() after taking the mmap\_sem for writing doesn't
modify any vma, so it's not obvious that it could cause a problem to the
coredump, but it happens to modify the pmd in a way that breaks an
invariant that pmd\_trans\_huge\_lock() relies upon. collapse\_huge\_page()
needs the mmap\_sem for writing just to block concurrent page faults that
call pmd\_trans\_huge\_lock().
Specifically the invariant that "!pmd\_trans\_huge()" cannot become a
"pmd\_trans\_huge()" doesn't hold while collapse\_huge\_page() runs.
The coredump will call \_\_get\_user\_pages() without mmap\_sem for reading,
which eventually can invoke a lockless page fault which will need a
functional pmd\_trans\_huge\_lock().
So collapse\_huge\_page() needs to use mmget\_still\_valid() to check it's
not running concurrently with the coredump... as long as the coredump
can invoke page faults without holding the mmap\_sem for reading.
This has "Fixes: khugepaged" to facilitate backporting, but in my view
it's more a bug in the coredump code that will eventually have to be
rewritten to stop invoking page faults without the mmap\_sem for reading.
So the long term plan is still to drop all mmget\_still\_valid().

nvme-tcp: fix queue mapping when queue count is limited
commit 6486199378a505c58fddc47459631235c9fb7638 upstream.
When the controller supports less queues than requested, we
should make sure that queue mapping does the right thing and
not assume that all queues are available. This fixes a crash
when the controller supports less queues than requested.
The rules are:
1. if no write queues are requested, we assign the available queues
to the default queue map. The default and read queue maps share the
existing queues.
2. if write queues are requested:
- first make sure that read queue map gets the requested
nr\_io\_queues count
- then grant the default queue map the minimum between the requested
nr\_write\_queues and the remaining queues. If there are no available
queues to dedicate to the default queue map, fallback to (1) and
share all the queues in the existing queue map.
Also, provide a log indication on how we constructed the different
queue maps.

mm: mmu\_gather: remove \_\_tlb\_reset\_range() for force flush
commit 7a30df49f63ad92318ddf1f7498d1129a77dd4bd upstream.
A few new fields were added to mmu\_gather to make TLB flush smarter for
huge page by telling what level of page table is changed.
\_\_tlb\_reset\_range() is used to reset all these page table state to
unchanged, which is called by TLB flush for parallel mapping changes for
the same range under non-exclusive lock (i.e. read mmap\_sem).
Before commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap\_sem in
munmap"), the syscalls (e.g. MADV\_DONTNEED, MADV\_FREE) which may update
PTEs in parallel don't remove page tables. But, the forementioned
commit may do munmap() under read mmap\_sem and free page tables. This
may result in program hang on aarch64 reported by Jan Stancek. The
problem could be reproduced by his test program with slightly modified
below.

The program may bring in parallel execution like below:
t1 t2
munmap(map\_address)
downgrade\_write(&mm->mmap\_sem);
unmap\_region()
tlb\_gather\_mmu()
inc\_tlb\_flush\_pending(tlb->mm);
free\_pgtables()
tlb->freed\_tables = 1
tlb->cleared\_pmds = 1
pthread\_exit()
madvise(thread\_stack, 8M, MADV\_DONTNEED)
zap\_page\_range()
tlb\_gather\_mmu()
inc\_tlb\_flush\_pending(tlb->mm);
tlb\_finish\_mmu()
if (mm\_tlb\_flush\_nested(tlb->mm))
\_\_tlb\_reset\_range()
\_\_tlb\_reset\_range() would reset freed\_tables and cleared\_\* bits, but this
may cause inconsistency for munmap() which do free page tables. Then it
may result in some architectures, e.g. aarch64, may not flush TLB
completely as expected to have stale TLB entries remained.
Use fullmm flush since it yields much better performance on aarch64 and
non-fullmm doesn't yields significant difference on x86.
The original proposed fix came from Jan Stancek who mainly debugged this
issue, I just wrapped up everything together.

ocfs2: fix error path kobject memory leak
[ Upstream commit b9fba67b3806e21b98bd5a98dc3921a8e9b42d61 ]
If a call to kobject\_init\_and\_add() fails we should call kobject\_put()
otherwise we leak memory.
Add call to kobject\_put() in the error path of call to
kobject\_init\_and\_add(). Please note, this has the side effect that the
release method is called if kobject\_init\_and\_add() fails.

scsi: smartpqi: properly set both the DMA mask and the coherent DMA mask

When SME is enabled, the smartpqi driver won't work on the HP DL385 G10

Basically, the fact that the coherent DMA mask value wasn't set caused the
driver to fall back to SWIOTLB when SME is active.
For correct operation, lets call the dma\_set\_mask\_and\_coherent() to
properly set the mask for both streaming and coherent, in order to inform
the kernel about the devices DMA addressing capabilities.

net: sh\_eth: fix mdio access in sh\_eth\_close() for R-Car Gen2 and RZ/A1 SoCs
[ Upstream commit 315ca92dd863fecbffc0bb52ae0ac11e0398726a ]
The sh\_eth\_close() resets the MAC and then calls phy\_stop()
so that mdio read access result is incorrect without any error
according to kernel trace like below:
ifconfig-216 [003] .n.. 109.133124: mdio\_access: ee700000.ethernet-ffffffff read phy:0x01 reg:0x00 val:0xffff
According to the hardware manual, the RMII mode should be set to 1
before operation the Ethernet MAC. However, the previous code was not
set to 1 after the driver issued the soft\_reset in sh\_eth\_dev\_exit()
so that the mdio read access result seemed incorrect. To fix the issue,
this patch adds a condition and set the RMII mode register in
sh\_eth\_dev\_exit() for R-Car Gen2 and RZ/A1 SoCs.
Note that when I have tried to move the sh\_eth\_dev\_exit() calling
after phy\_stop() on sh\_eth\_close(), but it gets worse (kernel panic
happened and it seems that a register is accessed while the clock is
off).

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't take kvm->lock around kvm\_for\_each\_vcpu
[ Upstream commit 5a3f49364c3ffa1107bd88f8292406e98c5d206c ]
Currently the HV KVM code takes the kvm->lock around calls to
kvm\_for\_each\_vcpu() and kvm\_get\_vcpu\_by\_id() (which can call
kvm\_for\_each\_vcpu() internally). However, that leads to a lock
order inversion problem, because these are called in contexts where
the vcpu mutex is held, but the vcpu mutexes nest within kvm->lock
according to Documentation/virtual/kvm/locking.txt. Hence there
is a possibility of deadlock.
To fix this, we simply don't take the kvm->lock mutex around these
calls. This is safe because the implementations of kvm\_for\_each\_vcpu()
and kvm\_get\_vcpu\_by\_id() have been designed to be able to be called
locklessly.

KVM: PPC: Book3S: Use new mutex to synchronize access to rtas token list
[ Upstream commit 1659e27d2bc1ef47b6d031abe01b467f18cb72d9 ]
Currently the Book 3S KVM code uses kvm->lock to synchronize access
to the kvm->arch.rtas\_tokens list. Because this list is scanned
inside kvmppc\_rtas\_hcall(), which is called with the vcpu mutex held,
taking kvm->lock cause a lock inversion problem, which could lead to
a deadlock.
To fix this, we add a new mutex, kvm->arch.rtas\_token\_lock, which nests
inside the vcpu mutexes, and use that instead of kvm->lock when
accessing the rtas token list.
This removes the lockdep\_assert\_held() in kvmppc\_rtas\_tokens\_free().
At this point we don't hold the new mutex, but that is OK because
kvmppc\_rtas\_tokens\_free() is only called when the whole VM is being
destroyed, and at that point nothing can be looking up a token in
the list.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Use new mutex to synchronize MMU setup
[ Upstream commit 0d4ee88d92884c661fcafd5576da243aa943dc24 ]
Currently the HV KVM code uses kvm->lock in conjunction with a flag,
kvm->arch.mmu\_ready, to synchronize MMU setup and hold off vcpu
execution until the MMU-related data structures are ready. However,
this means that kvm->lock is being taken inside vcpu->mutex, which
is contrary to Documentation/virtual/kvm/locking.txt and results in
lockdep warnings.
To fix this, we add a new mutex, kvm->arch.mmu\_setup\_lock, which nests
inside the vcpu mutexes, and is taken in the places where kvm->lock
was taken that are related to MMU setup.
Additionally we take the new mutex in the vcpu creation code at the
point where we are creating a new vcore, in order to provide mutual
exclusion with kvmppc\_update\_lpcr() and ensure that an update to
kvm->arch.lpcr doesn't get missed, which could otherwise lead to a
stale vcore->lpcr value.

xenbus: Avoid deadlock during suspend due to open transactions
[ Upstream commit d10e0cc113c9e1b64b5c6e3db37b5c839794f3df ]
During a suspend/resume, the xenwatch thread waits for all outstanding
xenstore requests and transactions to complete. This does not work
correctly for transactions started by userspace because it waits for
them to complete after freezing userspace threads which means the
transactions have no way of completing, resulting in a deadlock. This is
trivial to reproduce by running this script and then suspending the VM:
import pyxs, time
c = pyxs.client.Client(xen\_bus\_path="/dev/xen/xenbus")
c.connect()
c.transaction()
time.sleep(3600)
Even if this deadlock were resolved, misbehaving userspace should not
prevent a VM from being migrated. So, instead of waiting for these
transactions to complete before suspending, store the current generation
id for each transaction when it is started. The global generation id is
incremented during resume. If the caller commits the transaction and the
generation id does not match the current generation id, return EAGAIN so
that they try again. If the transaction was instead discarded, return OK
since no changes were made anyway.
This only affects users of the xenbus file interface. In-kernel users of
xenbus are assumed to be well-behaved and complete all transactions
before freezing.

perf record: Fix s390 missing module symbol and warning for non-root users
[ Upstream commit 6738028dd57df064b969d8392c943ef3b3ae705d ]
Command 'perf record' and 'perf report' on a system without kernel
debuginfo packages uses /proc/kallsyms and /proc/modules to find
addresses for kernel and module symbols. On x86 this works for root and
non-root users.
On s390, when invoked as non-root user, many of the following warnings
are shown and module symbols are missing:
proc/{kallsyms,modules} inconsistency while looking for
"[sha1\_s390]" module!
Command 'perf record' creates a list of module start addresses by
parsing the output of /proc/modules and creates a PERF\_RECORD\_MMAP
record for the kernel and each module. The following function call
sequence is executed:
machine\_\_create\_kernel\_maps
machine\_\_create\_module
modules\_\_parse
machine\_\_create\_module --> for each line in /proc/modules
arch\_\_fix\_module\_text\_start
Function arch\_\_fix\_module\_text\_start() is s390 specific. It opens
file /sys/module//sections/.text to extract the module's .text
section start address. On s390 the module loader prepends a header
before the first section, whereas on x86 the module's text section
address is identical the the module's load address.
However module section files are root readable only. For non-root the
read operation fails and machine\_\_create\_module() returns an error.
Command perf record does not generate any PERF\_RECORD\_MMAP record
for loaded modules. Later command perf report complains about missing
module maps.
To fix this function arch\_\_fix\_module\_text\_start() always returns
success. For root users there is no change, for non-root users
the module's load address is used as module's text start address
(the prepended header then counts as part of the text section).
This enable non-root users to use module symbols and avoid the
warning when perf report is executed.

s390/zcrypt: Fix wrong dispatching for control domain CPRBs
[ Upstream commit 7379e652797c0b9b5f6caea1576f2dff9ce6a708 ]
The zcrypt device driver does not handle CPRBs which address
a control domain correctly. This fix introduces a workaround:
The domain field of the request CPRB is checked if there is
a valid domain value in there. If this is true and the value
is a control only domain (a domain which is enabled in the
crypto config ADM mask but disabled in the AQM mask) the
CPRB is forwarded to the default usage domain. If there is
no default domain, the request is rejected with an ENODEV.
This fix is important for maintaining crypto adapters. For
example one LPAR can use a crypto adapter domain ('Control
and Usage') but another LPAR needs to be able to maintain
this adapter domain ('Control'). Scenarios like this did
not work properly and the patch enables this.

configfs: Fix use-after-free when accessing sd->s\_dentry
[ Upstream commit f6122ed2a4f9c9c1c073ddf6308d1b2ac10e0781 ]
In the vfs\_statx() context, during path lookup, the dentry gets
added to sd->s\_dentry via configfs\_attach\_attr(). In the end,
vfs\_statx() kills the dentry by calling path\_put(), which invokes
configfs\_d\_iput(). Ideally, this dentry must be removed from
sd->s\_dentry but it doesn't if the sd->s\_count >= 3. As a result,
sd->s\_dentry is holding reference to a stale dentry pointer whose
memory is already freed up. This results in use-after-free issue,
when this stale sd->s\_dentry is accessed later in
configfs\_readdir() path.
This issue can be easily reproduced, by running the LTP test case -
sh fs\_racer\_file\_list.sh /config
(https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/testcases/kernel/fs/racer/fs\_racer\_file\_list.sh)

perf/ring\_buffer: Add ordering to rb->nest increment
[ Upstream commit 3f9fbe9bd86c534eba2faf5d840fd44c6049f50e ]
Similar to how decrementing rb->next too early can cause data\_head to
(temporarily) be observed to go backward, so too can this happen when
we increment too late.
This barrier() ensures the rb->head load happens after the increment,
both the one in the 'goto again' path, as the one from
perf\_output\_get\_handle() -- albeit very unlikely to matter for the
latter.

perf/ring\_buffer: Fix exposing a temporarily decreased data\_head
[ Upstream commit 1b038c6e05ff70a1e66e3e571c2e6106bdb75f53 ]
In perf\_output\_put\_handle(), an IRQ/NMI can happen in below location and
write records to the same ring buffer:
...
local\_dec\_and\_test(&rb->nest)
... <-- an IRQ/NMI can happen here
rb->user\_page->data\_head = head;
...
In this case, a value A is written to data\_head in the IRQ, then a value
B is written to data\_head after the IRQ. And A > B. As a result,
data\_head is temporarily decreased from A to B. And a reader may see
data\_head < data\_tail if it read the buffer frequently enough, which
creates unexpected behaviors.
This can be fixed by moving dec(&rb->nest) to after updating data\_head,
which prevents the IRQ/NMI above from updating data\_head.

x86/CPU/AMD: Don't force the CPB cap when running under a hypervisor
[ Upstream commit 2ac44ab608705948564791ce1d15d43ba81a1e38 ]
For F17h AMD CPUs, the CPB capability ('Core Performance Boost') is forcibly set,
because some versions of that chip incorrectly report that they do not have it.
However, a hypervisor may filter out the CPB capability, for good
reasons. For example, KVM currently does not emulate setting the CPB
bit in MSR\_K7\_HWCR, and unchecked MSR access errors will be thrown
when trying to set it as a guest:
unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0xc0010015 (tried to write 0x0000000001000011) at rIP: 0xffffffff890638f4 (native\_write\_msr+0x4/0x20)

mISDN: make sure device name is NUL terminated
[ Upstream commit ccfb62f27beb295103e9392462b20a6ed807d0ea ]
The user can change the device\_name with the IMSETDEVNAME ioctl, but we
need to ensure that the user's name is NUL terminated. Otherwise it
could result in a buffer overflow when we copy the name back to the user
with IMGETDEVINFO ioctl.
I also changed two strcpy() calls which handle the name to strscpy().
Hopefully, there aren't any other ways to create a too long name, but
it's nice to do this as a kernel hardening measure.

In xhci\_debugfs\_create\_slot(), kzalloc() can fail and
dev->debugfs\_private will be NULL.
In xhci\_debugfs\_create\_endpoint(), dev->debugfs\_private is used without
any null-pointer check, and can cause a null pointer dereference.
To fix this bug, a null-pointer check is added in
xhci\_debugfs\_create\_endpoint().
This bug is found by a runtime fuzzing tool named FIZZER written by us.

powerpc/powernv: Return for invalid IMC domain
[ Upstream commit b59bd3527fe3c1939340df558d7f9d568fc9f882 ]
Currently init\_imc\_pmu() can fail either because we try to register an
IMC unit with an invalid domain (i.e an IMC node not supported by the
kernel) or something went wrong while registering a valid IMC unit. In
both the cases kernel provides a 'Register failed' error message.
For example when trace-imc node is not supported by the kernel, but
skiboot advertises a trace-imc node we print:
IMC Unknown Device type
IMC PMU (null) Register failed
To avoid confusion just print the unknown device type message, before
attempting PMU registration, so the second message isn't printed.

[ Upstream commit e633508a95289489d28faacb68b32c3e7e68ef6f ]
NFTA\_FIB\_F\_PRESENT flag was not always honored since eval functions did
not call nft\_fib\_store\_result in all cases.
Given that in all callsites there is a struct net\_device pointer
available which holds the interface data to be stored in destination
register, simplify nft\_fib\_store\_result() to just accept that pointer
instead of the nft\_pktinfo pointer and interface index. This also
allows to drop the index to interface lookup previously needed to get
the name associated with given index.

netfilter: nf\_queue: fix reinject verdict handling
[ Upstream commit 946c0d8e6ed43dae6527e878d0077c1e11015db0 ]
This patch fixes netfilter hook traversal when there are more than 1 hooks
returning NF\_QUEUE verdict. When the first queue reinjects the packet,
'nf\_reinject' starts traversing hooks with a proper hook\_index. However,
if it again receives a NF\_QUEUE verdict (by some other netfilter hook), it
queues the packet with a wrong hook\_index. So, when the second queue
reinjects the packet, it re-executes hooks in between.

perf/x86/intel/ds: Fix EVENT vs. UEVENT PEBS constraints
[ Upstream commit 23e3983a466cd540ffdd2bbc6e0c51e31934f941 ]
This patch fixes an bug revealed by the following commit:
6b89d4c1ae85 ("perf/x86/intel: Fix INTEL\_FLAGS\_EVENT\_CONSTRAINT\* masking")
That patch modified INTEL\_FLAGS\_EVENT\_CONSTRAINT() to only look at the event code
when matching a constraint. If code+umask were needed, then the
INTEL\_FLAGS\_UEVENT\_CONSTRAINT() macro was needed instead.
This broke with some of the constraints for PEBS events.
Several of them, including the one used for cycles:p, cycles:pp, cycles:ppp
fell in that category and caused the event to be rejected in PEBS mode.
In other words, on some platforms a cmdline such as:
$ perf top -e cycles:pp
would fail with -EINVAL.
This patch fixes this bug by properly using INTEL\_FLAGS\_UEVENT\_CONSTRAINT()
when needed in the PEBS constraint tables.

iio: imu: mpu6050: Fix FIFO layout for ICM20602
[ Upstream commit 1615fe41a1959a2ee2814ba62736b2bb54e9802a ]
The MPU6050 driver has recently gained support for the
ICM20602 IMU, which is very similar to MPU6xxx. However,
the ICM20602's FIFO data specifically includes temperature
readings, which were not present on MPU6xxx parts. As a
result, the driver will under-read the ICM20602's FIFO
register, causing the same (partial) sample to be returned
for all reads, until the FIFO overflows.
Fix this by adding a table of scan elements specifically
for the ICM20602, which takes the extra temperature data
into consideration.
While we're at it, fix the temperature offset and scaling
on ICM20602, since it uses different scale/offset constants
than the rest of the MPU6xxx devices.

Due to an issue on Spectrum-2, in front-panel ports split four ways, 2 out
of 32 port buffers cannot be used. To work around this, the next FW release
will mark them as unused, and will report correspondingly lower total
shared buffer size. mlxsw will pick up the new value through a query to
cap\_total\_buffer\_size resource. However the initial size for shared buffer
pool 0 is hard-coded and therefore needs to be updated.
Thus reduce the pool size by 2.7 MiB (which corresponds to 2/32 of the

mlxsw: spectrum\_router: Refresh nexthop neighbour when it becomes dead
The driver tries to periodically refresh neighbours that are used to

However, if the neighbour becomes dead, there is nothing we can do to
return it to a connected state and the above function call is basically
a NOP.
This results in the nexthop never being written to the device's
adjacency table and therefore never used to forward packets.

associating the nexthop with a new neigbhour which we will try to
refresh.

net: ethtool: Allow matching on vlan DEI bit

Using ethtool, users can specify a classification action matching on the
full vlan tag, which includes the DEI bit (also previously called CFI).
However, when converting the ethool\_flow\_spec to a flow\_rule, we use
dissector keys to represent the matching patterns.
Since the vlan dissector key doesn't include the DEI bit, this
information was silently discarded when translating the ethtool
flow spec in to a flow\_rule.
This commit adds the DEI bit into the vlan dissector key, and allows
propagating the information to the driver when parsing the ethtool flow
spec.

sunhv: Fix device naming inconsistency between sunhv\_console and sunhv\_reg
[ Upstream commit 07a6d63eb1b54b5fb38092780fe618dfe1d96e23 ]
In d5a2aa24, the name in struct console sunhv\_console was changed from "ttyS"
to "ttyHV" while the name in struct uart\_ops sunhv\_pops remained unchanged.
This results in the hypervisor console device to be listed as "ttyHV0" under
/proc/consoles while the device node is still named "ttyS0":
root@osaka:~# cat /proc/consoles
ttyHV0 -W- (EC p ) 4:64
tty0 -WU (E ) 4:1
root@osaka:~# readlink /sys/dev/char/4:64
../../devices/root/f02836f0/f0285690/tty/ttyS0
root@osaka:~#
This means that any userland code which tries to determine the name of the
device file of the hypervisor console device can not rely on the information
provided by /proc/consoles. In particular, booting current versions of debian-
installer inside a SPARC LDOM will fail with the installer unable to determine
the console device.
After renaming the device in struct uart\_ops sunhv\_pops to "ttyHV" as well,
the inconsistency is fixed and it is possible again to determine the name
of the device file of the hypervisor console device by reading the contents
of /proc/console:
root@osaka:~# cat /proc/consoles
ttyHV0 -W- (EC p ) 4:64
tty0 -WU (E ) 4:1
root@osaka:~# readlink /sys/dev/char/4:64
../../devices/root/f02836f0/f0285690/tty/ttyHV0
root@osaka:~#
With this change, debian-installer works correctly when installing inside
a SPARC LDOM.

sctp: Free cookie before we memdup a new one
[ Upstream commit ce950f1050cece5e406a5cde723c69bba60e1b26 ]
Based on comments from Xin, even after fixes for our recent syzbot
report of cookie memory leaks, its possible to get a resend of an INIT
chunk which would lead to us leaking cookie memory.
To ensure that we don't leak cookie memory, free any previously
allocated cookie first.

Check that the NFC\_ATTR\_TARGET\_INDEX attributes (in addition to
NFC\_ATTR\_DEVICE\_INDEX) are provided by the netlink client prior to
accessing them. This prevents potential unhandled NULL pointer dereference
exceptions which can be triggered by malicious user-mode programs,
if they omit one or both of these attributes.

net: tls, correctly account for copied bytes with multiple sk\_msgs
[ Upstream commit 648ee6cea7dde4a5cdf817e5d964fd60b22006a4 ]
tls\_sw\_do\_sendpage needs to return the total number of bytes sent
regardless of how many sk\_msgs are allocated. Unfortunately, copied
(the value we return up the stack) is zero'd before each new sk\_msg
is allocated so we only return the copied size of the last sk\_msg used.
The caller (splice, etc.) of sendpage will then believe only part
of its data was sent and send the missing chunks again. However,
because the data actually was sent the receiver will get multiple
copies of the same data.
To reproduce this do multiple sendfile calls with a length close to
the max record size. This will in turn call splice/sendpage, sendpage
may use multiple sk\_msg in this case and then returns the incorrect
number of bytes. This will cause splice to resend creating duplicate
data on the receiver. Andre created a C program that can easily
generate this case so we will push a similar selftest for this to
bpf-next shortly.
The fix is to \_not\_ zero the copied field so that the total sent
bytes is returned.

net: openvswitch: do not free vport if register\_netdevice() is failed.
[ Upstream commit 309b66970ee2abf721ecd0876a48940fa0b99a35 ]
In order to create an internal vport, internal\_dev\_create() is used and
that calls register\_netdevice() internally.
If register\_netdevice() fails, it calls dev->priv\_destructor() to free
private data of netdev. actually, a private data of this is a vport.
Hence internal\_dev\_create() should not free and use a vport after failure
of register\_netdevice().

realtek-smi switch lan0: failed to initialize vlan filtering on this port
This is because it is trying to disable VLAN filtering
on VLAN0, as we have forgot to add 1 to the port number
to get the right VLAN in rtl8366\_vlan\_filtering(): when
we initialize the VLAN we associate VLAN1 with port 0,
VLAN2 with port 1 etc, so we need to add 1 to the port
offset.

neigh: fix use-after-free read in pneigh\_get\_next
[ Upstream commit f3e92cb8e2eb8c27d109e6fd73d3a69a8c09e288 ]
Nine years ago, I added RCU handling to neighbours, not pneighbours.
(pneigh are not commonly used)
Unfortunately I missed that /proc dump operations would use a
common entry and exit point : neigh\_seq\_start() and neigh\_seq\_stop()
We need to read\_lock(tbl->lock) or risk use-after-free while
iterating the pneigh structures.
We might later convert pneigh to RCU and revert this patch.

lapb: fixed leak of control-blocks.
[ Upstream commit 6be8e297f9bcea666ea85ac7a6cd9d52d6deaf92 ]
lapb\_register calls lapb\_create\_cb, which initializes the control-
block's ref-count to one, and \_\_lapb\_insert\_cb, which increments it when
adding the new block to the list of blocks.
lapb\_unregister calls \_\_lapb\_remove\_cb, which decrements the ref-count
when removing control-block from the list of blocks, and calls lapb\_put
itself to decrement the ref-count before returning.
However, lapb\_unregister also calls \_\_lapb\_devtostruct to look up the
right control-block for the given net\_device, and \_\_lapb\_devtostruct
also bumps the ref-count, which means that when lapb\_unregister returns
the ref-count is still 1 and the control-block is leaked.
Call lapb\_put after \_\_lapb\_devtostruct to fix leak.

hv\_netvsc: Set probe mode to sync
[ Upstream commit 9a33629ba6b26caebd73e3c581ba1e6068c696a7 ]
For better consistency of synthetic NIC names, we set the probe mode to
PROBE\_FORCE\_SYNCHRONOUS. So the names can be aligned with the vmbus
channel offer sequence.

be2net: Fix number of Rx queues used for flow hashing
[ Upstream commit 718f4a2537089ea41903bf357071306163bc7c04 ]
Number of Rx queues used for flow hashing returned by the driver is
incorrect and this bug prevents user to use the last Rx queue in
indirection table.
Let's say we have a NIC with 6 combined queues:
[root@sm-03 ~]# ethtool -l enp4s0f0
Channel parameters for enp4s0f0:
Pre-set maximums:
RX: 5
TX: 5
Other: 0
Combined: 6
Current hardware settings:
RX: 0
TX: 0
Other: 0
Combined: 6
Default indirection table maps all (6) queues equally but the driver
reports only 5 rings available.
[root@sm-03 ~]# ethtool -x enp4s0f0
RX flow hash indirection table for enp4s0f0 with 5 RX ring(s):
0: 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1
8: 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3
16: 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5
24: 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1
...
Now change indirection table somehow:
[root@sm-03 ~]# ethtool -X enp4s0f0 weight 1 1
[root@sm-03 ~]# ethtool -x enp4s0f0
RX flow hash indirection table for enp4s0f0 with 6 RX ring(s):
0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
...
64: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
...
Now it is not possible to change mapping back to equal (default) state:
[root@sm-03 ~]# ethtool -X enp4s0f0 equal 6
Cannot set RX flow hash configuration: Invalid argument

LOCKED OUT久 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.

Check that the NFC_ATTR_TARGET_INDEX attributes (in addition to
NFC_ATTR_DEVICE_INDEX) are provided by the netlink client prior to
accessing them. This prevents potential unhandled NULL pointer dereference
exceptions which can be triggered by malicious user-mode programs,
if they omit one or both of these attributes.
