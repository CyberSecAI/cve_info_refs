Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the Lightning Network daemon (lnd) during channel opening. Specifically, when a node accepts a channel, it didn't verify that the funding transaction output matched the details provided in the `open_channel` message. This included:

*   **Incorrect amount:** The receiving node did not verify if the funding transaction output contained the correct amount as specified in the `open_channel` message.
*   **Incorrect scriptPubKey:** The receiving node did not always verify if the funding transaction output contained the correct scriptPubKey.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Validation:** The primary weakness was the absence of proper validation of the funding transaction details against the promised channel parameters.
*   **Trust in Counterparty:** The vulnerability effectively relied on the honesty of the peer initiating the channel opening process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Funds:** An attacker could claim to open a channel, but either not pay the full amount or not pay at all, effectively stealing funds from the victim node.
*   **Invalid Channel State:** The victim would be operating with an invalid channel state that would only be discovered when trying to close the channel, where the victim's commitment or mutual close transactions would be invalid.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Peer:** The primary attack vector is a malicious peer node connecting to the vulnerable lnd node.
*   **Manipulated Funding Transaction:** The attacker would provide a `funding_created` message with an incorrect outpoint referring to a funding transaction output with either an incorrect amount or an incorrect scriptPubKey.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connection:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection with the target node.
*   **Lightning Network Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker must have sufficient understanding of the Lightning Network protocol to manipulate the channel opening messages, specifically `open_channel` and `funding_created`.
*   **Crafted Transaction:** The attacker needs to create a bitcoin transaction with the correct transaction ID, but with an incorrect amount or scriptPubKey.
*  **Offline Target (for scriptPubKey exploit pre-v0.6):** To exploit the scriptPubKey vulnerability in v0.6.x, the target node has to be offline when the funding transaction receives the required confirmations and the node must also be running with `-txindex=0` on either full node backend.

**Versions affected:**

* lnd versions prior to v0.7.1 were vulnerable.
* v0.7.0 and above correctly check for the scriptpubkey
* v0.6.x partially enforce the funding scriptpubkey, but pre-v0.6.0 did not verify at all.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was discovered during protocol testing and was not exploited in the wild before it was patched.
*   The fix involved adding checks to verify the amount and the scriptpubkey of the funding transaction output against the provided details.
*   The vulnerability was present in c-lightning and eclair implementations as well, and assigned CVEs CVE-2019-12998 and CVE-2019-13000 respectively.
