The provided content details multiple crashes found in Edraw Max version 7.9.3 during a fuzzing session. Here's a breakdown of the identified issues:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap Corruption (Crash #01):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A heap corruption issue was triggered, leading to a crash within the `ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey` function.
    *   **Weakness:** Heap corruption due to improper memory handling.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash. The crash occurs within a low-level Windows system DLL, indicating a potentially serious flaw.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input file that exploits an unspecified flaw in the Edraw Max software.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need the ability to create or modify input files for the application.
*   **Read Access Violation (Crashes #02 & #03):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application attempts to read from an invalid memory address, resulting in a crash. These crashes occurred at seemingly random memory addresses (`8b560c5d` and `15ff8007`).
    *   **Weakness:**  Memory access violation due to an invalid pointer or memory corruption.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input file.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need the ability to create or modify input files for the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post provides crash details from Windbg, including register values at the time of the crash.
*   The author states that the crashes are identified by *msec.dll* as 'exploitable', suggesting the potential for more serious attacks.
*   The fuzzed samples and Windbg info are available for download on the author's GitHub repository.

**Summary:**

The blog post identifies three distinct crashes in Edraw Max 7.9.3. These vulnerabilities demonstrate poor memory handling within the application. While the immediate impact is application crashes, the *msec.dll* flags these as exploitable, which suggests a risk of more serious exploitation.
