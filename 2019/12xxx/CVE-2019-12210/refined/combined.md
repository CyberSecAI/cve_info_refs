# CVE-2019-12210

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-12209.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-12211.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12210 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12210)

#### Description

In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug\_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.

## Commit

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Do not leak file descriptor when doing exec

[Browse files](/Yubico/pam-u2f/tree/18b1914e32b74ff52000f10e97067e841e5fff62)

```
When opening a custom debug file, the descriptor would stay
open when calling exec and leak to the child process.

Make sure all files are opened with close-on-exec.

This fixes [CVE-2019-12210](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pxf2-5pmm-5r8f "CVE-2019-12210").

Thanks to Matthias Gerstner of the SUSE Security Team for reporting
the issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1135729#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-21 08:51:16 UTC  ``` Split-off from audit [bug 1087061](show_bug.cgi?id=1087061 "RESOLVED FIXED - AUDIT-0: pam_u2f: Whitelist PAM module"): This issue is for tracking the following of symlinks in the user's home directory for the auth_file:  ```     the file `$HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys` is blindly followed by the     pam module. It can be a symlink pointing to an arbitrary file. The PAM     module only rejects non- regular files and files owned by other users     than root or the to-be- authenticated user. Even these checks are only     made after open()ing the file, which may already trigger certain logic     in the kernel that is otherwise not reachable to regular users.        If `debug` is also enabled then most of the content of the file is     written either to stdout, stderr, syslog or to the defined debug     file. Therefore this can pose a big information leak to access e.g.     the contents of /etc/shadow, /root/.bash_history or similar sensitive     files.        For example use the following line in the PAM stack:        auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug        Then prepare a suitable symlink:        user$ mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico     user$ ln -s /etc/shadow ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys        Then authenticate the user on a text console:        host login: user     Password: XXX     [...]     debug(pam_u2f):  Authorization line: avahi:!:18019::::::     [...]        Notice the lines from /etc/shadow being output on the terminal. ```  This finding is still undisclosed and the publication date for this is:  CRD: 2019-06-04 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1135729#c4)  Karol Babioch   2019-05-28 19:53:08 UTC  ``` Addressed this in SLE codestreams:  - <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193686> - <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193687>  The openSUSE codestreams will either inherit it from SLE, or will be updated/bumped once this becomes public. Not sure what else will change with next upstream release, but personally I would prefer to bump the version instead of maintaining patches on top of an old release. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1135729#c5)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2019-05-28 20:35:33 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for IBS integration: This bug (1135729) was mentioned in <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193688> SLE-15 / pam_u2f ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1135729#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-06-04 13:10:40 UTC  ``` Upstream published the findings by now.

# CVE-2019-12209

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-12207.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-12210.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12209 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12209)

#### Description

Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f\_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and does not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other files on the system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the PAM configuration, part of the file contents of a symlink target will be logged, possibly revealing sensitive information.

## Description

In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug\_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1135727#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-21 08:47:35 UTC  ``` Split-off from audit [bug 1087061](show_bug.cgi?id=1087061 "RESOLVED FIXED - AUDIT-0: pam_u2f: Whitelist PAM module"): This issue is for tracking the file descriptor leak:  ``` - if the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug file   will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process. Therefore   this user can access write further information to it, possibly filling up a   file system. ```  Accessing the content of the debug file should not be possible, since the file descriptor is opened write only and Linux doesn't offer any way to change the access mode for open file descriptors.  This finding is still undisclosed and the publication date for this is:  CRD: 2019-06-04 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1135727#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-21 08:53:18 UTC  ``` This here is a more complete description of the issue:  ```     if the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug     file will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process.     Therefore this user can manipulate the information in the debug file and     also write further information to it, possibly filling up a privileged     file system.        In some contexts the program utilizing PAM closes off leaked file     descriptors but it does work with su, for example:        Use the following line in the PAM stack:        auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug debug_file=/tmp/u2f-debug.txt        The prepare the debug file such that the PAM module can open it:        root# touch /tmp/u2f-debug.txt        Then perform su on yourself as an unprivileged user:        user$ su user     Password: XXX     user$ ls -l /proc/$$/fd     [...]     l-wx------ 1 mgerstner users 64  8.

Subject: pam-u2f: CVE-2019-12210: debug_file file descriptor leak,
 CVE-2019-12209: symlink attack on u2f_keys leading to possible information
 leak

Hello,

pam-u2f [1] is a PAM module that allows to integrate universal 2nd
factor authenticators like YubiKey into the PAM stack. In the context of
a source code review [2] due to the inclusion of pam-u2f into SUSE Linux
two security issues in this PAM module have been uncovered as described
in the following sections.

CVE-2019-12210: debug_file file descriptor leak
-----------------------------------------------

If the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug
file will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process.
Therefore this user can write further information to it, possibly
filling up a privileged file system or manipulating the information
found in the debug file.

In some contexts the program utilizing PAM closes off leaked file
descriptors but it does work with su, for example, use the following
line in the PAM stack:

```
auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug debug_file=/tmp/u2f-debug.txt
```

Then prepare the debug file such that the PAM module can open it:

root# touch /tmp/u2f-debug.txt

Then perform su on yourself as an unprivileged user:

user$ su user
Password: XXX
user$ ls -l /proc/$$/fd
[...]
l-wx------ 1 user users 64  8. Mai 11:44 3 -> /tmp/u2f-debug.txt

As you can see the new user shell now has an open file descriptor for
the debug file.

CVE-2019-12209: symlink attack on u2f_keys leading to possible information leak
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file `$HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys` is blindly followed by the PAM
module. It can be a symlink pointing to an arbitrary file. The PAM
module only rejects non-regular files and files owned by other users
than root or the to-be-authenticated user. Even these checks are only
made after open()'ing the file, which may already trigger certain logic
in the kernel that is otherwise not reachable to regular users.

If the PAM modules' `debug` option is also enabled then most of the
content of the file is written either to stdout, stderr, syslog or to
the defined debug file.  Therefore this can pose an information leak to
access e.g.  the contents of /etc/shadow, /root/.bash_history or similar
sensitive files. Furthermore the symlink attack can be used to use other
users' u2f_keys files in the authentication process.

For example use the following line in the PAM stack:

```
auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug
```

Then prepare a suitable symlink:

```
user$ mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico
user$ ln -s /etc/shadow ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys
```

Then authenticate the user on a text console:

host login: user
Password: XXX
[...]
debug(pam_u2f):  Authorization line: avahi:!:18019::::::
[...]

Notice the lines from /etc/shadow being output on the terminal.

Bugfixes and Mitigations
------------------------

The bugfix for CVE-2019-12210 is found in [3]. It solves the issue by
passing `O_CLOEXEC` and more conservative flags to related `open()`
calls.

The bugfix for CVE-2019-12209 is found in [4]. It solves the issue by
dropping privileges to the to-be-authenticated user before accessing the
`u2f_keys` file.

Both bugfixes are contained in the upstream release 1.0.8 [5].

A major mitigation for both issues is to remove the `debug` and
`debug_file` options for `pam_u2f.so` in the PAM configuration.
Furthermore enabling the `openasuser` option will mitigate the symlink
attack in CVE-2019-12209.

Timeline and Responsible Disclosure
-----------------------------------

Communication with upstream was responsive and constructive over the
complete timeline.

2019-05-08: I reported the findings privately to the upstream maintainer.
2019-05-20: security@...ico.com has been involved and we worked out and
    reviewed patches together that have been agreed upon by this time.
2019-05-22: Yubico assigned CVEs for the issues.
2019-06-04: This was the established publication date and Yubico
    released a fixed version as planned.
