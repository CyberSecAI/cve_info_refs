The provided content is related to CVE-2019-12359. It describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities found in the zzcms project.

**Root Cause:** The root cause for all listed vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, when constructing SQL queries. The application directly includes the `id` parameter into SQL queries without using prepared statements or any form of sanitization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities are present due to the lack of input sanitization of the `id` parameter in the following files:
    *   `user/dls_print.php`
    *   `user/dls_download.php`
    *   `dl/dl_sendmail.php` (via COOKIE `dlid`)
    *  `dl/dl_sendsms.php` (via COOKIE `dlid`)
    *   `admin/deluser.php`
    *   `admin/dl_sendmail.php`
    *   `admin/showbad.php`
    *   `admin/ztliuyan_sendmail.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
*   **Server Compromise:** In some scenarios, advanced SQL injection techniques can lead to remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET/POST parameters:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the `id` parameter in HTTP GET or POST requests.
*   **HTTP Cookies:**  `dl/dl_sendmail.php` and `dl/dl_sendsms.php` are vulnerable via the `dlid` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any authentication for most of the mentioned injection points, but they need to be able to send requests to the application with a modified id parameter.
* For dl/dl_sendmail.php and dl/dl_sendsms.php an attacker needs to be able to set cookies
* In the case of admin files, attacker needs to have admin privileges.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable code constructs SQL queries using string concatenation, directly embedding the unsanitized `id` parameter into the query.
*   The code checks for a comma (`,`) in the `id` parameter to execute a specific branch of the vulnerable code, which is exploited to perform the injection
*   The `dlid` cookie is used in `dl/dl_sendmail.php` and `dl/dl_sendsms.php`
* The `n` parameter in `dl/dl_sendmail.php` and `dl/dl_sendsms.php` is used to bypass a condition that does not set the `dlid` cookie, allowing exploitation.
* The vulnerability is demonstrated using various payloads, including `UNION SELECT` and `sleep()` based injection.
