{
  "vulnerability": "CVE-2019-12269",
  "description": "Enigmail before 2.0.11 allows PGP signature spoofing: for an inline PGP message, an attacker can cause the product to display a \"correctly signed\" message indication, but display different unauthenticated text.",
  "affected_component": "thunderbird-enigmail",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Enigmail processes and displays inline PGP messages. It incorrectly indicates a message as correctly signed, while actually displaying different, unauthenticated content.",
   "weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of inline PGP messages",
    "Failure to properly verify message authenticity",
        "Displaying a signed message indication when the displayed content is unauthenticated."
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can trick a user into believing an email is signed and authentic, when in fact it has been tampered with. This could lead to various attacks, such as phishing or malware distribution, as the user would trust the displayed content. This is a spoofing vulnerability and it can have an impact of integrity and trust in communication.",
  "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, where a crafted email is sent to a target user. The malicious content is embedded within an inline PGP message.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious email that includes a specially crafted inline PGP message. The attacker does not need access to the victim's private key or other sensitive information.  They need to be able to send an email to the victim.",
