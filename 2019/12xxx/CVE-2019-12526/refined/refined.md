Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-12526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an incorrect buffer management issue within Squid when processing URNs. Specifically, when receiving data from a remote server in response to a URN request, Squid doesn't properly ensure that the response fits within the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. Due to the lack of size checks, an attacker-controlled response can overflow the allocated heap buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overflowing the heap, a malicious client can potentially write arbitrary data, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Denial of service (DoS):** On systems with memory access protections (like ASLR), the overflow can lead to the Squid process being terminated unexpectedly, causing a DoS for all clients using the proxy.
- **Information Disclosure:** In some cases the overflow can overwrite adjacent memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker sending a specially crafted URN request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URN request to the Squid proxy server. This could be done by a client directly using the proxy or by an intermediary if the traffic is proxied.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Squid versions 3.x up to and including 3.5.28, and 4.x up to and including 4.8.
- Squid version 4.9 is not affected, as it contains the fix.
- A workaround is available by denying the "urn:" protocol URI being proxied via access control lists (ACL).
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jeriko One, and the fix was implemented by Eduard Bagdasaryan.
- The issue is related to the handling of URN response and doesn't affect the request side.
