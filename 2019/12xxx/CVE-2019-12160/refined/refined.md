The provided content describes a heap-use-after-free vulnerability in the GoHttp server.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability occurs due to a use-after-free condition, where memory is freed and then accessed again. Specifically, the memory allocated within `handleHttpGET` is freed in the `checkMime` function but later used in `sendHeader`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-use-after-free: The core vulnerability is the use of memory after it has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Program crash: As seen in the provided output, the vulnerability leads to a crash of the server application due to the ASAN (AddressSanitizer) detection.
- Potential code execution: While not explicitly demonstrated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can be exploited to potentially gain arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated in a predictable manner.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending an HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the GoHttp server. The request processing within `handleHttpGET` initiates a memory allocation and subsequent use.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: An attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the server, such as via the `curl` utility in the example.
- No authentication or special privileges needed: The vulnerability appears to be triggered by normal HTTP requests, suggesting no need for authentication or specific privileges.

**More Details:**
The provided output from the ASAN analysis gives a clear call stack, showing that the memory is allocated in `handleHttpGET`, freed in `checkMime`, and then used again in `sendHeader`. This detailed information is more comprehensive than a standard CVE description, as it gives function names, locations, and the sequence of operations leading to the vulnerability.
