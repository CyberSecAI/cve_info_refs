# Exploit Title: Verint Impact 360 login CSRF
# Date: 7-13-2020
# Exploit Author: Ryan Delaney
# Author Contact: ryan.delaney () owasp org
# Author LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/infosecrd/>
# Vendor Homepage: <https://www.verint.com/>
# Software Link:
<https://www.verint.com/engagement/our-offerings/solutions/workforce-optimization/>
# Version: Impact 360 v15.1
# Tested on: Impact 360 v15.1
# CVE: CVE-2019-12784

1. Description

An issue was discovered in Verint Impact 360 15.1. At wfo/control/signin,
the login form can accept POST submissions from external sources. This may
allow attackers to compromise credentials via bruteforce login attempts
through users in the target environment running JS provided by the attacker
(e.g. malvertising) via XHR, and be notified of a successful login attempt
via a unique callback from CVE-2019-12783 to an attacker-owned web server,
even if the site is not accessible to the attacker due to firewall rules or
network configuration.

2. Mitigation

Create firewall rules to drop traffic going to the Impact 360 system with
an external referrer.
Request a patch from Verint. Verint has not patched this vulnerability to
my knowledge, despite having been made aware of it over a year ago.

3. PoC

Withheld due to possible legal threat.

## What is workforce optimization?

Workforce Optimization (WFO) is a unified suite of cloud solutions for capturing interactions and managing the performance of employees across the enterprise. WFO can help you improve customer experience, scheduling, and operational efficiency by providing appropriate staffing levels and empowering employees.

In the contact center, WFO involves solutions with pre-defined workflows that deliver unique information to help enhance contact center productivity and quality.

This includes workforce management, call recording, automated quality management, performance management, speech, text, and desktop analytics and much more.

## What are the benefits of workforce optimization?

With workforce optimization, you can answer the most pressing questions facing your contact center:

* How do I easily balance employee flexibility with staffing needs and costs?
* How do I save money while improving customer experience?
* How do I reduce effort, improve processes and empower my workforce?
* What type of WFO analytics are required to improve customer engagement?
* What’s next for WFO in my organization?

 ![Woman in office sitting using laptop]()
## How do I balance employee flexibility with staffing needs and costs?

Customers expect prompt resolution of their issues. They can take their business to another provider at any moment. Whether you’re an enterprise or a **[small or medium-sized business (SMB)](/grow-my-smb-business/)**, the contact center is a vital component of your business.

However, delivering great customer experiences, while also keeping costs lows and balancing workload, staffing, and other resources isn’t easy. How do you ensure the right employees are in the right place at the right time?

You need to easily navigate:

* Appropriate staffing levels to meet customer demand across multiple channels, work queues, product lines, and locations.
* Scheduling staff based on skills, shift preferences and customer demand and expectations.
* Employee demands for flexibility.

[**Verint Workforce Management**](/verint-workforce-management-professional/) can help you easily and accurately forecast and schedule your employees, while still providing them the flexibility they need to manage their jobs with their busy lives.

## How do I reduce effort, improve processes and empower my workforce?

Once you have the right employees in place, how do you make sure they’re becoming effective, customer-focused employees? Your agents handle a variety of communications, from calls to chats and emails. How do you evaluate their performance and take the guesswork out of quality management?

You need to:

* Make it easier for employees to know how they are doing all the time.
* Identify where to train and coach based on more than just a small sample.
* Help your managers assess productivity, compliance and accuracy.

**[Verint Automated Quality Management](/automated-quality-management/)** helps ensure your employees are following the right processes by leveraging AI to automate the entire quality management process, from scoring evaluations to assigning coaching.

[**Verint Performance Management**](/verint-performance-management-professional/) helps you capture data across multiple systems to efficiently track, manage, and improve individual and organizational performance.

## What type of analytics are required to improve customer engagement?

Optimizing customer interactions is a continuous process. Organizations must have broad visibility across all interactions to spot new trends and opportunities for improvement.

You need to:

* Capture and analyze customer interactions, journeys, and sentiment across channels.
* Enhance the quality and efficiency of customer interactions.
* Uncover business trends and areas of opportunity.

True omnichannel intelligence requires capturing, indexing, archiving and retrieving voice, video, and text interactions across multiple channels. Verint **[Enterprise Recording](/enterprise-recording/)** can capture all types of communications along with rich contextual data, providing an omnichannel view of your customers’ journey.

**[Speech and Text Analytics](/speech-analytics/)** provide critical insight into customer calls, chats and emails to help you uncover insights into your customers and your business. Now you can transcribe and analyze millions of calls to discover customer insights and improve contact center performance in the cloud.

## What’s next for WFO?

The market has made a massive shift towards automation recently in response to growing complexity and ever-increasing customer expectations. Workforce Optimization (WFO) solutions improve staffing, efficiency, and quality. The good ones can even help better engage employees.

But, are they truly helping agents solve problems in real-time? Are they helping your agents deliver personalized service? Do they consider human-to-robot interactions and handoffs?

Move beyond Workforce Optimization and view your challenges and goals through the lens of [**Workforce Engagement**](/workforce-engagement/).
