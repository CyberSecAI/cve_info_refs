CVE-2019-12312: IKEv2 bogus Informational Exchange request can cause NULL pointer dereference
```

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12312:

*   **Vulnerability:** NULL pointer dereference
*   **Root Cause:** Libreswan attempts to send an encrypted error message in response to a bogus IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchange request received *before* the IKE\_AUTH exchange is completed. Because the IKE\_AUTH exchange hasn't finished, no encryption key exists. The attempt to encrypt the error message without a key leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Affected Versions:** Libreswan 3.27
*   **Fixed Versions:** Libreswan 3.0 - 3.26, 3.28 and later
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL packet before the IKE\_AUTH exchange.
*   **Exploitation:** By repeatedly sending such packets, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing and restarting the libreswan service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the Libreswan instance.
*   **Workaround:** Reconfigure IKEv2 connections to use IKEv1.
*   **Patch:** The provided patch in `ikev2_send.c` adds a check to ensure that `SKEYSEED` has been calculated (meaning IKE\_AUTH has completed) before attempting to send an encrypted response. If `SKEYSEED` hasn't been calculated, the packet is dropped, and an error is logged.
