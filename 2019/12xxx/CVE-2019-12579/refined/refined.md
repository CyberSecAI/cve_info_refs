Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `openvpn_launcher.64` binary, part of the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN client, is setuid root.
- The binary takes parameters that are then passed to operating system commands using a Here document.
- The parameters are not sanitized before being used in the shell command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization of user-provided parameters allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
- **Setuid Binary:** The `openvpn_launcher.64` binary running with setuid root privileges makes exploitation more severe because the injected commands will execute with root privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local, unprivileged attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- This can lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable binary on the target system.
- An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a local account on the system where the vulnerable PIA VPN client is installed.
- The attacker must have the ability to execute the `openvpn_launcher.64` binary.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by passing specially crafted arguments to the `--dns` parameter. The vulnerable code uses these parameters within a here-document, allowing shell metacharacters like `$()` to inject commands for execution.
- The exploit example provided in the document uses shell command substitution `$()`  to execute the `id` command, which outputs the user's id (and proves root execution as a result).  The output is redirected to `/dev/tty` so it can be viewed.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content includes specific steps to reproduce the vulnerability on both Linux and macOS.
- The vulnerability was present in PIA VPN client version v82 and was fixed in a later rewritten version (v1.2.1+).
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2019-06-10.
