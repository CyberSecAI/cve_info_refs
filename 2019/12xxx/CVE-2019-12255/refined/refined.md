  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the TCP component of the Wind River VxWorks TCP/IP stack (IPNET). Specifically, it involves a manipulated TCP Urgent Pointer with a value of 0 which leads to an integer underflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Underflow",
       "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the target device. It could also lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of array management data, or denial of service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted TCP packets with a manipulated TCP Urgent Pointer to a device.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device, but no authentication or user interaction is required."
