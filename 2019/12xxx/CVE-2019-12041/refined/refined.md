Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a regular expression (regex) used to parse HTML tags, specifically the handling of CDATA sections within HTML.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The regex pattern used to match CDATA tags (`<![CDATA[...]]>`) is vulnerable to ReDoS. Specifically, a crafted input with many repetitions of 'a' within the CDATA section can cause the regex engine to perform excessive backtracking, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- The vulnerable code is located in `lib/common/html_re.js` at line 47.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to hang or become unresponsive by providing specially crafted input strings that trigger the vulnerable regex. This prevents the application from processing requests correctly and can lead to service disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides a markdown string containing a crafted HTML tag with a large CDATA section (e.g., `<![CDATA[aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa]]>`) as part of the input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `remarkable` markdown parser, particularly user-controlled content where this vulnerability can be exploited through the rendering of markdown.
- No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to provide input to the vulnerable application, meaning the attacker could be an anonymous user or an authenticated user who provides crafted input.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The issue was reported on May 13, 2019.
