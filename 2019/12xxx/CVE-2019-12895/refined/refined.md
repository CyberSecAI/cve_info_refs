The provided content details three distinct crashes found in Alternate Pic View through fuzzing, which aligns with the nature of a potential vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The crashes are caused by malformed input files that trigger memory corruption issues within Alternate Pic View.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **User Mode Write AV:** A write access violation occurs due to an out-of-bounds write to memory controlled by the attacker. `mov dword ptr [edx+4],ebx` where the address `edx+4` (01000003) points to invalid memory, causing a crash
- **Read Access Violation at the Instruction Pointer:** A read access violation occurs when the instruction pointer (EIP) is set to an invalid address (c0000000). This indicates a likely control-flow hijack vulnerability, where the attacker has influenced EIP with an invalid address
- **Exception Handler Chain Corrupted:** A crash occurs due to a corrupted exception handler chain, with an attempt to perform an out-of-bounds memory access `add dword ptr [edx+edx*8+0Fh],esi` with an invalid address `32e19684`. This could be an indication of a stack overflow or heap overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of these vulnerabilities is a crash of the Alternate Pic View application.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the "Read Access Violation at the Instruction Pointer" and "Exception Handler Chain Corrupted" crashes suggest that an attacker could potentially gain arbitrary code execution by controlling program flow.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious image files crafted to exploit the identified vulnerabilities are used as the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted image file to the victim using Alternate Pic View.
