Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-12390:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided text explicitly mentions "CVE-2019-12390" in the context of an Anviz product vulnerability. The text states that a vulnerability allows the retrieval of sensitive data, such as "cleartext passwords/pins, RFID tag, name, and several other personal parameters".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The core issue is that the proprietary network protocol used by Anviz devices does not require any authentication or authorization. This means that anyone with network access to the device can send commands and receive data. The password, when configured, is not verified or transmitted on the network.
   - **Insecure Protocol Design:** The protocol itself is not secure. It lacks any encryption, nonce usage, or proper session management. This allows for trivial replay attacks and eavesdropping.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Cleartext Transmission:** Sensitive information, including user passwords, PINs, RFID data, and user names, is transmitted in cleartext over the network.
   - **Replay Attacks:** The lack of nonces or session management makes the protocol vulnerable to replay attacks. Previously captured commands can be replayed to trigger actions on the device.
   - **Bypass Authentication:** The device does not properly enforce password authentication. An attacker can access or modify data without needing to provide a password.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve all stored user information, including sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) and authentication credentials.
   - **Unauthorized Access:** Malicious actors can open doors controlled by the device by replaying captured commands.
   - **System Compromise:** The lack of authentication allows attackers to manipulate device settings and potentially compromise the device further (although this specific impact is described under the other related CVEs).
   - **Lateral Movement:** By gaining access to the device, attackers can use it to gather network information and potentially pivot to other systems.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is over the network, exploiting the lack of authentication in the proprietary TCP protocol used on port 5010.
   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker on the same network can eavesdrop on the communication, capture data, and replay commands.
   - **Internet Exposure:** Devices exposed directly to the internet via port forwarding are especially vulnerable and an attacker can achieve remote compromise.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Anviz device, or have a connection to the device on port 5010.
   - **Protocol Understanding:** A basic understanding of the device's proprietary protocol is necessary for crafting commands, though existing tooling can simplify this task.
   - **Basic Network Tools:** Attackers can use tools like Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic and a script to generate malicious requests.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

- **SDK Analysis:** The provided content describes how the researchers used the official Anviz SDK to understand the protocol and its shortcomings.
- **Reverse Engineering:** A significant portion of the research involved reverse engineering the proprietary protocol and the checksum function used by the devices.
- **Discovery of Multiple CVEs:** The content mentions multiple CVEs, suggesting a broad range of vulnerabilities across the Anviz product line.
- **Disclosure Challenges:** It details the challenges in getting Anviz to respond to the vulnerabilities reported, leading the researchers to disclose their findings publicly and coordinate with CSIRT.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-12390 and related information.
