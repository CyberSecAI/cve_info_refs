# Changelog

**Important note:** manual patches are being released continuously, so if you are a FileRun client,
please check the forum at <https://feedback.filerun.com> for the latest changes.

### FileRun Update **2024.1.2** (August 2024)

* **Important fixes**
  + Ability of independent admins to create/edit roles when their accounts are configured with a home folder template path and a space quota.
  + Independent admin users which have a home folder template path assigned and a space quota assigned cannot create or edit user accounts because the "Home folder" tab is not shown, and they don't have access to setting a required space quota.
  + The "Maximum login attempts" limit did not apply when the provided user credentials were correct but the 2FA code was not. Now it does, so the user no longer has unlimited 2FA tries.
  + Fixed undisclosed account enumeration vulnerability.
  + Fixed blank display of the URL in the web linking panel under "Albums".
  + The option to set a download limit is no longer shown when sharing via link a folder or collection. This applies also to when sending a folder via e-mail as web link; the overwritten setting for download limits will not apply to shared folders.
  + Safari prevents right-clicking where a window with an IFRAME was open, even though it is no longer visible.
  + Fixed scrolling the user signup page on mobile devices, which worked only by dragging on certain areas.
  + Fixed display of "Send a notification now" checkbox when creating a new user account.
* **Important changes**
  + E-mailing files as password protected web links no longer includes the password in the shared link, and needs to be separately communicated to the recipients.
  + Guest users created by independent admins or users created by independent admins, are now owned/managed by the independent admin user. This also means that they will take out of the independent admin's "Max users" quota and the admin's space quota.
  + Removed the Pusher.com integration. It provided too little benefit, and it was not used enough to warrant maintenance. A new column is now available in the control panel list of users. It is named "Last seen" and it shows how long ago the user accessed FileRun by any means. The list of users can be sorted by the column, to show users likely to be online.
  + **User sign up process changes**
    - The option "Automatically generate the passwords." is now enabled by default and users cannot signup by specifying their own passwords. They will however be asked to change the password on first login.
    - FileRun no longer e-mails activation links. The e-mail address is validated through the temporary credentials the user will need in order to login.
    - The e-mail address is now a requirement when using the self-registration process. The username can no longer be specified by the visitors and the e-mail address will automatically be used for the username. That is because the validation can be used to obtain valid usernames, which can then be used for brute force attacks.
    - The generated passwords are now at least 12 characters long, regardless if the minimum length in the password policy settings allow for shorter.
    - Fixed reCAPTCHA handling.
  + The template file for the e-mail message is no longer "customizables/emails/signup\_email.tpl.txt". If you wish to customize the e-mail message, make a copy of the file "core/includes/emails/english/signup.tpl.php" to "customizables/emails/signup.tpl.php" and edit the copy accordingly.
* **Other**
  + Renamed from "Your account has been deactivated!" to "Your account has been deactivated!" for accounts that haven't logged in before.

  + The "Trash" is no longer shown for guest users when they have the ability of making changes.
  + The "Add to" -> "Photo album" option is no longer shown for users without home folders, thus missing the "Photos" section.
  + The superuser can no longer delete a role which is assigned to new users via third-party authentication.
  + Fixed collapsible fieldsets not collapsing when unchecking the box.

  + Fixed PHP error under certain circumstances when trying to list the users in the control panel.
  + Prevented "Account deactivated" action to be triggered more than once on multiple failed login attempts.
  + Removed the option to login with the 2FA code typed inside the password field because it was causing problems with passwords which happened to include a forward slash character followed by 6 characters at the end of the password.
  + Included the error code in the user activity log entry for failed login attempts.
  + Reintroduced the "User manual activation" and the "User manual deactivation" activity log entries which are added when a user account is deactivated/reactivated by an admin user.

### FileRun Update **2024.1.0** (May 2024)

* ### Highlights

  + Refreshed user interface with better ergonomics, improved keyboard accessibility and better mobile experience (including for the control panel).
  + Many fixes and smaller improvements (the list bellow is not comprehensive).
  + **Under the hood:**
    - The UI library has been reworked from the ground up.

  + Fresh new modern UI with theme editor.
  + File uploads on steroids. Reliably uploads anything you throw at it.
  + Faster everything.
  + Many improvements tags related.
  + Better third-party authentication integration.
  + Many security fixes and improvements.
  + Many smaller fixes and improvements which are not documented because the list would just become to large.
* ### Full list of changes

  + Support for PHP 8+
  + ### Security and authentication

    - ### Fixed vulnerabilities

      * Fixed undisclosed critical security vulnerability #1.
      * Fixed undisclosed critical security vulnerability #2.
      * Fixed undisclosed critical security vulnerability #3.
      * Fixed undisclosed critical security vulnerability #4.
      * Fixed undisclosed non-critical security vulnerability.
      * Fixed the permission "User can download folders and collections" which was still allowing collections to be downloaded even when disabled.
      * Fixed e-mail enumeration vulnerability.
      * To disable the 2-step verification, the user now needs to provide the current verification code.
      * Improved CSRF protection.
      * Improved brute force protection on session ids.
    - ### Third-part authentication

      * Possible breaking changes
        + The authentication options are still available but not as customizable plugins.
        + If your current authentication method is no longer available in the FileRun version, the update will reset the authentication back to FileRun default.
        + If you need to continue to use a custom authentication plugin, please [contact us](https://filerun.com/contact) for options before installing this update.
        + If you are using an external login form, the target URL changed. "/?module=fileman&page=login&action=login" no longer works and instead you need to HTTP POST the form, including the variable "filerun\_login\_action" (any value would do), to the FileRun installation root URL.
        + PHP sessions are no longer being used:
          - "$\_SESSION['FileRun']['username']" is no longer a possible way to automatically sign in FileRun users.
          - The PHP settings no longer have any impact on how the user authenticated sessions are being handled.
          - There is a control panel option for choosing to log the users out when they are closing their browsers. There is also a control panel option for choosing to log other sessions out and keep only the last login.
      * Added option to login with Google.
      * Added option to login with Dropbox.
      * Added option to login with Box.com.
      * Added option to login with Facebook.
      * Added option to login with Microsoft (Azure AD OAuth2).
      * "WordPress v4" authentication is now "WordPress" and has been tested with WordPress versions 5 and 6 and the SSO process is much smoother, redirecting to the WP login form and then straight back to FileRun.
      * "SimpleSAMLphp v1" is now "SimpleSAMLphp" and has been tested also with SimpleSAMLphp version 2 (tested with 2.0.3).
      * LDAP
        + The LDAP authentication plugin is now using the "Bind DN" to retrieve the user's record and group information.
        + Fix: The remote groups are now synced for the user accounts also when signing in using IWA SSO.
        + Improved troubleshooting.
      * Added dedicated authentication option for "Microsoft Active Directory". It extends the LDAP option with default settings for quicker or alternative setup.
    - Added option to force the last login to be the only authenticated session. This will log out all other active browser sessions, and will not affect existing OAuth2/API sessions or WebDAV access.
    - FileRun now informs the user with a message when he gets logged out because the authentication session expired.
    - FileRun now records inactivity logouts to the user acitivity log, so you can see when it happens and even attach e-mail notifications to it.
    - Guest accounts can now also be limited by IP.
    - When the third-party authentication plugin is limited to a particular IP address range, the third-party authentication is completely disabled for other users (no longer attempting login against the third-party system, nor showing the SSO button).
    - Signing in as a different user now logs the logout+login actions.
    - The action of removing a guest user account which no longer has access to any shares is now logged to the user activity log.
    - Logging out via the OAuth2 consent screen now logs the action as normal.
    - Fixed not updating last user login date when logging in via SSO.
    - Gracefuly allow signing in with another user account if the login page is open in one tab while already signed-in in another tab.
    - Accessing WebDAV with the main user account credentials when 2FA is enabled now results in a HTTP "400 Bad Request" error. This is more intuitive, rather than confusingly allowing the user access for just a few seconds until the current verification code expires.
  + ### Important fixes

    - Fixed crash of Android Nextcloud app when accessing FileRun.
    - Fixed warning in both ownCloud and Nextcloud apps regarding unsupported server version.
    - Fixed compatiblity with ONLYOFFICE 7.1
    - Fixed problem with user getting logged out because of inactivity while uploading large files.
    - Multiple files/folders can be now shared at the same time also anonymously.
    - CSV Editor plugin: Fixes saving changes. Fixed horizontal scrolling. Fixed support for non-UTF8 files.
    - Fixed FileRun not loading for users which do not have the permission to upload files nor make changes.
  + ### File Upload

    - You can now sync changes from a local folder to the remote one, in the browser, by simply dragging and dropping that folder into FileRun. Files with the exact same bytesize and same modification time, will simply be skipped.
    - You can now upload massive number of files while being able to use FileRun smoothly.
      The uploader no longer lists all files to be uploaded, but instead it groups the files by folders. Also, uploading more than 10 files, it groups them into one.

      It uses considerably less memory and CPU.
    - You can now upload image files to FileRun by directly dragging them from other web pages into the FileRun UI.
    - You can now upload also the empty folders in a selection, using copy+paste and drag+drop. Note: The folder upload via the "+ New" menu does not preserve empty folder structures (browser limitation (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=360412)).
    - Preserves files and folder last modified date from the user's computer to the server.
    - ### Fault tolerance

      * Intelligent automatic retries with various time intervals.
      * The upload queue no longer stops for any reason. Regardless if files/folders fail to transfer, the queue will continue until the last item.
      * The files/folders which failed to transfer, can be individually retried at any later time.
      * It lets users know if the network connection goes offline and automatically resumes when the connection is restored, regardless of how long that might take or in which stage of the transfer the connection went offline.
      * The number of max simultaneous files uploading drops automatically to 1 when a slow network connection speed is detected.
      * If an interrupted chunk has been actually successfully saved on the server, no longer errors out, but automatically skips ahead accordingly to resume the transfer.
      * Two different computers uploading the same file at the same time won't error, and it won't corrupt the file data either.
      * If a temporary upload file gets removed from the server durring a transfer, the file transfer automatically starts over.
    - Skips uploading folders like "@eaDir", ".DS\_Store" or "$RECYCLE.BIN"
    - Skips files which are not allowed on the server before even trying to upload them.
    - Multiple users can successfully upload the same file, in the same folder, at the same time, without competing with each other and without corrupting the file.
    - Dynamic chunk size, adjusted automatically based on the user's connection speed, to allow users on slow connections to restore interrupted uploads more efficiently. FileRun helps you now never loose more than 5 minutes of upload.
    - Long uploads no longer log the users out.
    - More accurate individual and overall progress when transfers get interrupted/resumed.
    - Much more accurate transfer speed calculation and time remaining estimates, putting more weight on more recent transfer speeds, and taking into account server response times.
    - If a file transfer fails, the percent completed is still displayed.
    - Takes into account file's modification date to avoid resuming the wrong transfer if the file has been changed in the meantime.
    - You can upload the same file in multiple folders at the same time.
    - Better progress indicator when uploading a large number of empty files or folders.
  + ### UI and UX

    - ### Fresh new modern UI

      * Clean and streamlined, bringing the focus back on the content.
      * Smooth transition between the light and dark mode with many improvements for the dark mode.
      * The folder location of a selected file is now prominently displayed at the top of the file list. This allows you to identify files much quicker, compared to waiting for the selected file's information to be loaded on the "Details" panel.

        Particularly useful when browsing collections, search results or looking at the new shortcut files.
      * Colorful tags can now be displayed in the list of files and folders, in all display modes. You get to choose how many tags to display, and if they are displayed as a tag icon or textually.
      * ### Improved file viewer

        + Redesigned for bringing the focus on the file.
        + Remade for experience and performance.
        + Added touch support. Swipe left and right to browse images. Using pinching with panning for zooming.
        + You can click next to an image/file, instead of the back arrow, to close/hide the viewer.
        + You can now click the file's name to change it.
    - ### Themes

      * Brand new theme editor which allows you to completely customize the colors of the UI, both for the light and the dark version.
      * It is much easier now to create a custom theme.
      * The Google Drive theme has been replaced with the blue FileRun theme (which is now inline with the new Google Drive looks).
      * Breaking change The Corporate theme has been discontinued. The theme will revert to the FileRun default theme, with a black and white color scheme.
      * Added the possibility of applying different themes based on user id, via the configuration file.
    - Optimized the "Compact" and "Detailed" list view modes:
      * The file extension is now closer to the file name.
      * The file and folder labels are also shown now separate from the file icon/thumbnail.
      * There is more room available for longer names, particularly on mobile
      * The thumbnail column can be used to sort files by type.* Tooltips for checking long filenames.
    - Added a compact list display mode for the file browser. With this mode there are no thumbnails loading.
    - Added options for adding links like "Privacy", "Impressum", "Terms" or "Help" to the login page.
    - The OAuth2 login page has been replaced with the main FileRun login page.
    - Added control panel option for preventing search engines from indexing files shared by web links.
    - The login page is now fully responsive. It fits better any screensize, also after changing device orientation.
    - Improved usability of the control panel on mobile devices.
    - Breaking change If you have set a hex color code for "Page background" you will need to use an image now, or use the new control panel theme customization options for it (though note that the "Surface" color used for the login page is also used for the main user interface, and you will need to keep it very light).
    - Added possibility of loading custom CSS files based on user groups.
    - Updated third-party services icons.
    - Audio player volume is now 100% by default.
    - Much better experience using slider controls (such as the audio player progress track) on touch devices.
    - Various other UI improvements
    - Added buttons to open the file preview and "Open with.." options in new browser tabs.
    - Fixed saving values to multiple-value metadata fields without pressing TAB or Enter before submitting the form.
    - Added option to share created web links via the user's operating system integrated sharing UI.
    - The metadata window can be now maximized.
    - The "Activity" tab shows the new entry count bubble again.
    - Fixed contextual menu options for newly created collections and albums, to allow management and sharing.
    - Added option to show logo on the login page at the top of the form.
    - Fix: contextual menu "Copy/Move" is no longer shown when the user doesn't have upload permission.
    - All metadata, comments, tags and colors are now shown for folders inside Trash.
    - Additional data which loads under the Details tab is now cached, so it no longer have to load twice from the main view to the file viewer and back.
    - Holding shift when deleting files will automatically select the option for permanent deletion.
    - ### Keyboard operations

      * Ctrl+F now shows a field for selecting files and folders by searching text in their filenames. Similar to the browser's "Find" function, but limited to the listed files and folders and instead of highlighting, it actually selects the items.
      * Ctrl+Shift+A will select all items of same type as the one selected. If it is a folder, all folders will be selected. If it is a file, all files with the same file extension as the selected one will be selected.
      * Removed D as keyboard shortcut for deleting items. "Delete" key remains the only way.
      * Removed R as keyboard shortcut for renaming items. "F2" key remains the only way.
      * Removed S as keyboard shortcut for searchin items. "CTRL+S" key remains the only way.
      * Creating a new folder is now done using the plus (+) key, instead of N.
      * CTRL+Enter opens items in a "New tab".
      * "Page Up" and "Page Down" for scrolling the file list.
      * After closing the file viewer, the focus now returns to the file list, so that you can continue using the keyboard.
      * 0-5 keys change the rating of the selected files/folders.
    - ### UI fixes

      * Fixed sorting of shared folders.
      * Fixed broken UI when user has no permissions of making any changes to files.
      * Shares listed under a user, in the tree panel, did not show details, such as stars, web links or colors.
      * Changing metadata is reflected right away in the Details panel.
      * Removing one value from a "Multiple values" metadata field by clicking the value's X button. The button got hidden, but the value was not removed upon saving.
      * Going back/forward using the browser history between FileRun UI states which include searching
      * Resizing the browser when a modal window is shown, now keeps the window in view.
      * A moved window which got hidden is now preserving the position when being shown again.
      * Fixed not being able to paste text inside FileRun's various promps and fields.
      * Fixed inline video playback of videos on Safari mobile.
      * Fixed showing if a file/folder which is shared by other users is in a one of the user's own collections.
      * Fixed dark mode not being automatically applied for ONLYOFFICE.
      * Fixed login background color when one is set.
      * Made sure popups windows do not open larger than the browser body size on smaller screens or scaled-up desktops.
    - Added right-click option to create new collections and photo albums.
    - Better thumbnails for CSV files: no third-party software requirement, very fast generation, sharp text, columns and rows borders, and dark mode support.
    - Files/folders get removed from the list when unstarring while under the Starred section.
    - Brought the search panel closer to the search button to make it easier for big screens.
    - The profile pictures are now resized on the server for smoother results.
    - Showing full date on mouse over the "Modified" date field in the grid.
  + ### Tags

    - Tags of multiple selected files/folders can be now managed in bulk.
    - You can now specify colors for new tags, like this: tag|color. The color can be HTML color name (ex: red, green, blue, etc.) or a hexadecimal value. If you do not specify a color, one will automatically be assigned.
    - You can now change the color of an existing tag, by clicking the tag and choosing "Change color". (The change will apply only for the selected files/folders.)
    - The sorting is now reversed, with the newest tag being shown first.
    - You can add multiple tags at the same time, if the text is separated by comma (,) or by semicolon (;). Pasting also works.
    - A new tag can no longer be added to a file/folder which already has it but with different capitalization.
    - Tags are now being shown in color under "Photos" > "By tag".
    - 2 tags are by default displayed in the list of files. You can change that from the control panel section "Interface".
    - Tag suggestions list is now sorted by frequency of use.
    - The permission required for viewing tags remains the same as before, though now it is named "User can view metadata".
    - Added option to copy all tags from a file.
    - Multiple tags with same text but different case are no longer allowed.
  + ### Labels and colors

    - The labeling feature has been replaced by the tags feature. Use the "Quick tag" option from the contextual menu. The predefined tags can be customized from the configuration file, just as one could customize the labels in the previous versions.
    - Existing labels will be replaced with tags of same color.
    - Note: unlike labels, tags are not affected by language translations.
    - Breaking change: If you had e-mail notifications rules set for labeling, for example on "Label received", you will need to update these rules to use "Tag received" instead.
    - ### Folder colors

      * Labeled folders will preserve the icon color, which can be now changed using the "Change color" option.
      * The option is available only for folders.
      * The permission to set custom folder icon colors requires the "*User can make changes to files and folders*" and for a shared item, the permissions must include "*Make changes*". This update will not alter user permissions in any way, so if needed you will have to do that yourself manually.
      * Colors are now shown for folders also when choosing the target folder for a copy/move action.
  + ### Search

    - Made the search panel a bit more intuitive.
    - Content search: Added compatibility with all the newer ElasticSearch server versions. Tested with up to ElasticSearch version 8.5.2.
    - Breaking change If you continue to use an old ElasticSearch version, you will need to add the following line inside "customizables/config.php": $config['elasticsearch\_legacy'] = true;
    - Added control panel option for resetting the ElasticSearch index, and also for clearing the indexing queue.
    - Added compatibility with newer Elasticsearch versions. If you upgrade Elasticsearch, remember to press the "Test server" button from the FileRun control panel. If you reinstall Elasticsearch, see the "reindex\_files.php" command line script on this page https://docs.filerun.com/command\_line\_tools to reindex your documents.
  + ### Nextcloud apps

    - Fixed crash on Android.
    - Fixed warning in both ownCloud and Nextcloud apps regarding unsupported server version.
    - Fix ability to remove editing permissions from a web link via Nextcloud desktop app.
    - Fixed WebDAV/Sync not working with some files from Windows servers which can miss modification times.
    - Dekstop sync: added config option for not taking the device ID into account when checking for changes. Set $config['system']['webdav']['skip\_device\_id\_for\_etag'] = true; inside the config file.
  + ### Other Improvements

    - Improved overall server-side performance.
    - Added the possibility of editing multiple files at the same time with Google Docs Editor.
    - The file "Edit" function always opens in a new browser tab. The same when creating new files from the "New" menu.
    - Allows users without download permission to access the media library features.
    - Creating new files with plugins always opens in a new browser tab, to allow the user to return to file management operations before being done with the new file.
    - The installation wizard is now accessible by the FileRun superuser from the FileRun control panel section called "Reinstall". This can be used to reset the FileRun installation to factory default, but also just for checking that the server meets the requirements.
  + ### Other changes

    - Added partial support for AVIF image files. Thumbnail generation and sizing metadata extraction. Because we don't have the date taken metadata, they will not show under "Photos" media library. (Might require an update on ImageMagick (at least v7.0.25). Same for Vips and GraphicsMagick, make sure you update them.)
    - Changing file/folder rating is now logged independently of metadata.
    - When a guest user tries to access FileRun and there are no shares and his account gets deleted, the login access attempt gets logged now.
    - Updated CommonMark markdown parsing and added an extension for tasks lists.
    - Metadata change details are now shown in a file/folder activity log.
    - Fix: The user activity of changing a file's metadata now logs the action, as it should have, to the user activity log and to the file activity log.
    - Fixed not being able to add own admin account to a group by editing the group.
    - Creating two files with the same name but different case, is no longer possible.
    - Forced usernames to lowercase for accounts created via the API.
    - The QR code image that is generated when sharing a link can be now downloaded.
    - Better error logging in the user activity when failing to delete files/folders.
    - Added config option to delete files/folders to the trash folder by copy+delete instead of move, to allow cross-disks moves. Enable like this: $config['system']['trash']['use\_safe\_move'] = true;
    - Gallery Web Links: Added buttons to access a file's details page, to read possible shared metadata and comments.
    - Gallery Web Links: now use a lightbox for all file types, to allow a smooth experience for browsing folders with both photos, videos and other types of files.
    - Fixed share web link via Linkedin option.
    - XMP and/or Exif metadata is now extracted from WEBP files, allowing these files to show under the "Photos" media library.
    - Improved XMP compatibility extraction of photo creation date and caption.
    - Remote groups are now synced to FileRun every time a user logs in with remote credentials.
    - Fixed WebDAV compatibility with Enpass.
    - Added definition for delimited values text files to group .csv, .tsv and .tab files as type of files that can be connfigured to edit/open by default with a particular plugin. This type of files now preview by default with the CSV editor instead of the Text Viewer.
    - The "Folder index" plugin now sorts file/folder names in a case-insensitive way.
    - Added support for webloc MacOS bookmark files.
    - Improved speed of reading a PNG dimensions.
    - PNG metadata from the tEXt textual data ancillary chunks is now imported.
    - Every image generated by FileRun is now in SVG format, so PHP GD is no longer a requirement.
    - Fixed mime types of CSS files served via FileRun, in order to be accepted by browsers as stylesheets.
    - Better handling of MySQL connection when it timesout due to long PHP process activity.
    - Fixed display of image files which are wider than the browser window, when opening image files via web links.
    - Screenshots pasted in the browser will be uploaded with the name received from the browser. This is usually the same one every time, something like "image.png", so it will overwrite a potentially existing file with the same name. This change was needed in order to preverse the name of files uploaded individually by copy/paste. Because there is no way to distinguish pasting a file from cliboard or from the file system, they were both ending up named like "Pasted image 2022-07-17 14-37-37.png".
    - Limited pasting images with preview to 10MB to prevent browser from crashing.
    - If no image processing tool is found or functioning, just output web-safe images as they are for both thumbnails and image previews. For those few cases where the managed image files are low res.
    - Breaking change If you are running Nginx and you are unable to use the FileRun API or WebDAV/sync access after the update, review your Nginx+PHP configuration and use the [updated official guide](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/phpfcgi/) to correctly configure your server to register the PATH\_INFO environment variable. (The workaround which was included in FileRun to help with misconfigured server has been now removed.)
    - The "HTML Editor" plugin, which was previously shipped disabled, has been now removed entirely.

### FileRun Update **20220519** (May 2022)

### Summary of this fantastic update

* Much much better mobile experience. Automatic dark mode, installable PWA, embedded PDF viewer.
* Upload by copy+paste! From Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder into your browser! ð¤¯
* [Mount as Windows drive](https://docs.filerun.com/webdav#windowsconnecting_with_explorer) without third-party apps.
* Edit files with your desktop Microsoft Office without downloading. Changes get saved back to FileRun!
* Very fast loading of the UI, lower memory requirements, smoother browsing of massive folders.
* The "Photos" view mode shows a much nicer photo grid, and it is now available while browsing any folder.
* Collections can now hold files and folders that are shared by other FileRun user accounts. Users without home folders can now also create and manage their own collections.
* Lots and lots of improvements and fixes, including security fixes.

* ### Notes for developers

  + The FileRun favicons have been updated and the entire "images/favicons" will be replaced. If you have customized the favicon files, you will need to restore your versions from the backup folder the update creates inside "system/data/temp/" back to "images/favicons/".
  + All FileRun core JavaScript and CSS files have changed.

    The only JS/CSS customizations that will be preserved through this update are the ones made via external files ("customizables/theme.css" for CSS and "$config['app']['ui']['custom\_js\_url']" for JS) and the ones made via plugins.

    If you made changes to any FileRun code, you will want to verify that everything looks and works as desired after installing this update.
  + The file "customizables/include.html" is no longer parsed as Smarty code. It is also no longer included in the free FileRun version.
  + Updated the TinyMCE plugin to work with the latest version.
* ### Security

  + Vulnerability Fix Fixed moderate security vulnerability allowing XSS attacks from one FileRun user to another. Thanks to Christian PÃ¶schl and the "usd AG" Responsible Disclosure Team.
  + Warning Please make sure you are not runing an old version of GhostScript on your server. Your server can otherwise be easily compromised by any FileRun user exploiting some critical vulnerabilities. Thanks to Dr. Jens Mueller for the responsible disclosure.
  + Improvement Better security for authenticated cached content such as thumbnails and previews.
* ### Mobile Browsers

  + Much better experience on mobile, for sharing, searching, tagging, commenting, editing text files.
  + Full support for dark mode.
  + FileRun now offers the option to install itself as a PWA (Progressive Web App), to open like a native app and use the full screen.
  + Faster initial loading, faster navigation through folders, better performance with large lists of files and folders, less memory usage.
  + PDF and Office file preview
    - Added PDF viewer plugin which is automatically used by the "Open in browser" plugin to open PDF documents on mobile devices without downloading the entire file nor leaving the browser.
    - It is used also by the "LibreOffice Viewer" plugin to view office documents on mobile devices.
    - This works also for when sharing PDF and office files via web links.
    - This plugin can also be used separately, though the default "Open in browser" plugin provides much better performance and experience on desktop.
    - It has support for loading very large documents progressively.
    - It remembers the last read page and can load a document fast from that particular page.
* ### Photos

  + The "Photos" display mode is now available anywhere, including physical folders, virtual folders or the search result. Note that the photos will be shown with proper aspect ratio only if the file metadata has been imported in FileRun, othwerwise the thumbnails will be square because FileRun imports metadata only on upload on when manually triggered.
  + The "Photos" display mode is now using the full available space for a more aesthetically pleasing gallery.
  + Added ability of users without access to metadata to view photos and videos in full aspect ratio, as well as sort files by metadata document types.
  + Photos and videos can now be added to collections with a single click from the "Details" panel.
  + Added tree menu option under "Photos" to show only videos.
  + FileRun now imports into metadata image sizes of WebP files.
  + Added JFIF to be handled as JPG image files.
  + Added top toolbar button under "Photos" > "Albums" for creating new photo albums.
  + Option to create photo proof sheet is now shown only when image files are selected.
* ### File management

  + Big Improvement Added compatibility with Windows native WebDAV. You can mount your FileRun account as a Windows drive without any third-party program. Please see [this page](https://docs.filerun.com/webdav#windowsconnecting_with_explorer) for details. Requires that you access your server via HTTPS.

    This also means that you can use any third-party software for keeping files/folders from your cumputer in sync with FileRun, without having to use the Nextcloud desktop sync apps.

    Also, successfully tested support for Finder's "Connect to server" on MacOS.
  + Big Improvement Files and folders can be uploaded from desktop to FileRun, by copy/paste. Tested on Edge, Chrome and Safari. Not supported on Firefox.
  + Big Improvement Files and folders can be uploaded by drag and drop from desktop to a FileRun folder wherever that folder is being shown, including search results, collections, starred, etc. It also prevents dropping the files in there if permissions do not allow.

    With this change one can upload now files by drag and drop to shared folders without having to browse to the folder first.
  + **Big Improvement** Collections can now contain files and folders that are shared from other FileRun user accounts. Users without home folders can now create and manage their own collections.
  + **Big Improvement** The "Office" plugin now opens files via WebDAV to allow editing and saving back to FileRun without having to manually upload the file. First time is being used, it will ask for credentails.

  FileRun will attempt to get the filename or page title from the URL, to use as a filename to identify the linked resource.
  URL files now have "thumbnails" showing that they are links and the hostname of the linked website.
  CTRL+V is one option and the other is from the "New" > "Link external file", where you are given a simple prompt to paste the URL with no other options.

### FileRun Update **2021.12.07**

* ### New User Interface

  The entire user interface has been reworked, with high attention to every little detail.

  + Great **mobile experience**. It adapts to screens of any size to provide a smooth and intuitive experience. Supports touchscreen laptops, handling both mouse and touch selection in the best way.
  + It is now a **progressive web app (PWA)**, so that you can add it to your desktop or mobile phone home screen. (Requires HTTPS access.)
* ### New UI options

  + The folder tree panel can be collapsed for more space for the files list. It is particularlly useful when browsing photos in the new "Photo" view, or documents in the new "Large thumbnails" view. The setting is remembered in the browser.
  + Listing files and folders in "Detailed list" now allows you to sort without keeping the list split between folders and files. The option is found under the file list options menu.
  + New display mode **"Large"**
    - It shows twice larger thumbnails.
    - It displays both documents and photos in full aspect ratio.
    - It shows when an image file has transparency.
    - It is great for brwosing documents and photos.
    - It replaces the previous "Photos" view mode.
  + **Filter files** by metadata file type. You can leave the filter enabled and continue browsing around folders looking for particular types of files. The Image/Audio/Video file list view modes have been removed.
  + Tags can be added to multiple files/folders at the same time. Simply select multiple items and use the "Add tags" field on the "Details" panel.
  + Multiple files can be star rated at the same time. Just select the desired files and use the star rating option found on the "Details" panel. If any of the selected files already has a rating, its value will be overwritten.
* ### UI Performance improvements

  + Direct links to **subfolders now open instantly**, regardless of how deep the folder is located. Browsing directly to a sub folder no longer loads the parent folders unnecessarily. Yet, it still displays the full location, allowing you to browse parent folders.
  + Uploading folders now updates the folders structure in the tree menu in real time, so you can browse directly to a subfolder that was just uploaded, or that it hasn't even finished uploading!
  + Optimized code for faster display, **snappier feeling** and less browser memory usage.
  + Creating new folders now shows the new folders in the folders tree menu instantly.
  + **Pagination for large folders!** The maximum number of files you wish to list per page can be configured from the FileRun control panel. The pagination also applies to search results, so you can now see the full number of results. (Current limitation to be addressed in the future: sorting inside paginated folders is always done in an alphanumeric way by file name.)
  + **Very fast thumbnail generation**
    - Using "libvips" (https://www.libvips.org) instead of ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick, generating thumbnails can be almost instantaneous for average photo files on average server hardware.
    - The supported file formats are "jpg,jpeg,tif,tiff,png,webp,pdf,hdr,gif,exr,svg". Other file formats would still be processed with your current ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick configuration.
    - The "vipsthumbnail" binary must be installed on the server, and enabled from the FileRun control panel. Make sure you are using Vips version 8.10 or higher.
  + Long file management operations, including calculating a large folder size, no longer lock other FileRun action.
  + Space quotas no longer slow down the login and the loading of the user interface. Refreshing the quota usage no longer blocks other requests.
  + Listing more than 100 subfolders in the folder tree panel no longer loads metadata for the folders, as it becomes too slow to browse. Therefore, in these cases the folders in the tree panel would no longer show if they are shared or if they have notifications or changes.
* ### Much improved file viewer

  + Much better image viewing experience.
  + Shows now all files in the list, regardless if FileRun can generate thubmnails and previews for.
  + Faster loading previews for non-image files.
  + If files are selected, the viewer will cycle only through the selected files. Use this to preview only certain files.
  + It now shows if an image has transparency.
  + Added information when previewing an empty file (0 bytes file size).
  + Opening the file viewer no longer disturbs the file list scroll position.
* ### Uploading

  + Uploading a folder which contains files or folders with names which are not allowed, automatically skips those files, no longer interrupting the whole transfer anymore for user input.
  + Uploading folders now updates the folder tree in real time. This allows you to browse/manage the uploaded folders before the whole transfer completes.
  + The upload panel shows the file upload speed again.
  + The large Nextcloud uploads no longer show temporary folders inside the user's home folder. The temporary folders are now hidden. Added support for deleting a temporary upload folder by Nextcloud on a failed chunked upload, so no folders are left behind.
* ### Usability improvements

  + The list of files is sorted in a more natural way. Sorting is now done in a case-insensitive way, non-latin characters and numbers are sorted better as well. The browser's first preferred language is also taken into consideration.
  + **The "Activity" panel**
    - The "Activity" tab now shows also own user actions. $config['app']['folder\_activity']['show\_own'] config option no longer exists.
    - The "Activity" tab now includes the actions made on the folder iteself, when a folder is selected, not only actions made on content.
    - When no file or folder in the list is selected, the activity tab will show all the activity inside that folder and subfolders. The list is grouped by file/folder, so instead of seeing multiple actions made on the same file or folder, you will only see the last action for that file/folder. The number of other actions made is shown.
    - When selecting a particular file or folder in the list, you see all the actions performed on that file, no longer groupped. $config['app']['folder\_activity']['show\_all\_actions'] config option no longer exists.
  + **The "Details" panel**
    - The details panel is collapsed by default on screen sizes that are not large. It can be displayed using the info button on the top toolbar, or by using the new file context menu option "View details".
    - The preview on the details panel now shows if the image has a transparent background. This helps also identify the image aspect ratio.
    - Added option to change label from the details panel.
    - The details panel shows when the file list is filtered (by audio/video/photos).
    - The "Deleted from" details now links for quickly opening the location an item was deleted from.
    - The "Details" tab now shows the metadata type for the selected file or folder.
  + **Thumbnails**
    - Thumbnails are focusing the center for photos and the top for documents.
    - Document thumbnail loading is animated, to provide hints on the page size.
    - The thumbnail display mode is now flexible, stretching and shrinking folders and files as needed to use all the available space.
    - Added control panel option for choosing the seek time for the frame selected out of videos for thumbnails.
  + **The audio player**
    - The audio player no longer closes when leaving the music media library folders.
    - The audio player no longer opens automatically when browsing the music media library.
    - For users who do not have download permissions but they have only preview permission, the audio player now opens directly rather than inside the file viewer.
    - It can now be disabled from the control panel.
    - Added option to disable autoplaying the next file in the audioplayer.
  + **Inside the trash folder**
    - Files in the trash folder can now be previewd.
    - You can now read comments on files/folders inside the trash folder.
    - The trash folder no longer groups folders at the top, but shows files and folders sorted by deletion date.
  + Increased the text/code editor font size.
  + Added contextual menu option for copying a folder's path to clipboard.
  + Added tooltips on most clickable actions.

  + Added ability to calculate total file size of multiple collections and photo albums together.
  + Better handling renaming current folder.
  + Selecting more than one file to delete now shows a confirmation prompt. This can also be used for deleting permanently instead of to the trash.
  + Added warning when deleting files from outside the home folder or a shared folder in order to prevent accidental deletion from places such as the Starred, Collections or other virtual locations.
  + To prevent accidental file changes, creating a new file from the "+ New" menu no longer allows overwriting existing files.
  + Autosave is now enabled by default for the ONLYOFFICE editors.
  + **The Download cart**
    - Better feedback adding files and folders to the download cart.
    - Added contextual menu option for adding files to download cart, without having to drag the files from the list to the toolbar menu item.

## April 1, 2021 (2021.03.26)

#### Summary of the most important changes:

* File plugins can be now used with shared web links.
* Allow visitors to edit files shared via web links.
* "Preview without download" permission available for both user accounts or web links.
* New plugins for spliting and merging PDF documents.
* Three new themes.
* Other improvements and fixes

* #### Web links improvements

  + The following plugins can be now used to display files shared via web links: 3D Viewer, LibreOffice Viewer, ONLYOFFICE, Office Web Viewer, Zoho, OpenDocument Viewer, Markdown Viewer, Bing Maps, Google Maps, Text Editor, E-book Reader, Markdown Viewer, Open in browser, Video Player, Google Docs Viewer, Link Opener, Audio Player.

    The plugins used for previewing or editing files via web links can be selected from the FileRun control panel section "Files > Plugins > Defaults".
  + A web link to a file can now be shared in 4 different modes:
    - **With preview**: it opens a HTML page with a preview.

      The preview is generated by the plugin configured for the particular type of files.

      Image Viewer plugin can be used to show previews for non web-safe image files, such as raw images, PSD, etc.

      Important: This is the default way web links open now. Old links that you might have used to embed files into other applications or web sites, would require the following parameter "**&fmode=open**" appended to them.
    - **Open in browser**

      Just lets the browser handle the file. If it's a plain text file, a PDF document, or an image file that is supported by the browser, the browser will open it directly. If browsers can't handle the file type, they usually provide the visitors with the option to save the file to their computers.
    - **Force download**

      The browser will always provide the visitors with the option to save the file to their computers.
    - **Editable**

      This mode looks similar to the preview mode, but it can use a different FileRun file plugin, that might provide the ability to edit the file. The plugins used with this mode are configurable for the various types of files from the FileRun control panel, under "Files > Plugins > Defaults".

      This mode is available only with the permission to edit the file. This new permission is enabled under the "Advanced" panel when editing the web link.
  + You can now disable the download permission on a link.
    - If you set a preview plugin for the web links, the preview will still be shown.

      The plugins that can handle non-download previews are the same as above.

      If you do not configure plugin previews for web links, they would just show a file type icon with the message that there is no preview available.
    - This works also when sharing entire folders.
  + The "Prevent the browser from opening the file." option is no longer available. If you wish the links to provide the download, select "Force download" option under the web link URL, or append "&fmode=download" to old web links. $config['app']['weblinks']['force\_download'] = ['txt', 'csv']; can still be used to prevent the browser from opening files that have the specific extensions (txt and csv for this example).
* #### Preview without download

  Users that are not allowed to download files can be now given permission to preview files.

  You can also now disable the download permission on a link which might still allow previewing.

  Available preview options:
  + "LibreOffice Viewer" and "Open in browser" plugins can be configured to allow PDF previews even when the user doesn't have download permissions but has preview permission. The PDF files will open without toolbar, making it difficult (but not impossible!) to save the PDF preview file.
  + "Zoho" plugin can also be configured to allow previewing without download permission. Note though that Zoho allows exporting spreadsheets and presentations from the editor to the original file format, so it does not protect from downloading. For word documents, it allows printing, so that can be used for exporting as PDF.
  + The "Autodesk" plugin allows previews without permission to download the file. This is safe as the original file never gets on the user's computer.
  + The "Audio Player" and "Video Player" plugins can be configured to allow playback of media files without the permission to download the file. Note that this does not keep the original files safe!
  + Other plugins, without download permission, will either show the file's thumbnail, an icon or no preview at all.
  + In the future, more plugins will be able to display limited previews without downloading capabilities.
  + If you do not configure plugin previews for web links, they would just show a file type icon with the message that there is no preview available.
  **Very important notes:**+ This is not a safe view-only access to data. There is no such technology. Use this only with non-sensitive data that you do not mind sharing with other people.
  + It is still possible to select and copy text, or extract image data from the generated PDF previews.
  + It is technically possible to extract textual content out of an image preview.
  + It is still technically possible to download/save the generated PDF files to the users computers.
  + For image files of smaller resolution, the thumbnail is the same as the file, so saving the thumbnail to the visitors computers would technically be the same as downloading the original file.
* #### Unified file preview

  + Preview all files in a folder, or from a search result, with next and previous buttons. All file types are now included.
  + More screen space for previewing documents and the preview can be made fullscreen.
  + Shows edit option for editable files. (This option shows only when the file type has a default editing plugin configured inside the FileRun control panel "Files" > "Plugins" > "Default".)
* #### New plugins:

  + **Extract PDF pages**. You can extract a range of pages (1-5 or 5-1), or a list of separate pages (1,2,3), or any combination of ranges and separate pages (1, 5-10). The extracted pages can be in separate PDF files or in a combined one.
  + **Merge PDF files**. Two or more PDF documents can be merged into a new document. The order you select the files dictates the order the pages are copied into the merged document.
  + **CSV Editor**: edit .csv files in a spreadsheet-like way.
  + **Text Viewer**: read plain text files more comfortable and with support for the dark theme.
* Videos can be now browsed through the Videos media library option by the date their were taken and by tags. Date taken and GPS location metadata is now imported from video files, if available. Note that this requires a [metadata reindexing](https://docs.filerun.com/metadata#indexing_metadata_from_files).
* #### User interface improvements

  + New theme "Google Drive". Similar to the default blue, but flat with white top bar.
  + New theme "Microsoft OneDrive". Flat with square corners, thin and blue top bar, orange folders.
  + New theme "Zoho". Flat with squarer corners, black folder tree, green highlights.
  + Added "Edit" right-click option. This option shows only when the file type has a default editing plugin configured inside the FileRun control panel "Files" > "Plugins" > "Default".
  + Audio files can be opened in the audio player in a new browser tab.
  + Multiple files and folders can be now selected without using the keyboard, but instead using checkboxes that show over their icons when one or more items are selected.
  + You can now configure file plugins to hide the options for creating new files. You can allow users to edit files with plugins such as Google Editor without having the options of creating new documents with this plugin under the "NEW" button.
  + Added dark theme support for Markdown viewer.
  + Various cosmetic and ergonomic improvements.
* #### Other Improvements

  + The "Autodesk" plugin now reuses uploaded documents for generating previews instead of uploading the files to the Autodesk server on every preview.
  + Added option to the "Create photo proof sheet" plugin to autorient images.
  + Creating weblinks via API can be now done with all the options available via the user interface.
  + Added DPX and EXR as supported image file types.
  + Added the possibility of creating a new group of users from other groups or from all existing users.
  + The "Image Editor" plugin has now options for adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation and sharpness.
  + The E-book reader now opens the book where you left them. It also provides options for adding bookmarks. Note that information on bookmarks and the last read page is saved in the browser's cache.
  + Downloading a single file now takes advantage of Chromium automatic download resuming, so it resumes the download when the connection gets interrupted.
  + Sped up thumbnail generation for video files by using ffmpeg also for scaling.
  + The Image Viewer plugin, which is used when previewing images via web links can now show small resolution previews for non web-compatible image files. This plugin can also be used to show quick previews for non web-safe image files via the versioning panel.
  + The metadata fields of type "Single value" can be now filed quicker by typing to jump to a predefined value.
  + The metadata fields of type "Small text", "Normal text" and "Multiple values" can be configured with autocompletion, where metadata values from other files are being suggested as the user types in.
* #### Other Fixes

  + Fixed opening PDF files and previews in newer Chromium versions.
  + Fixed possibility of downloading entire home folder.
  + Fixed LibreOffice Viewer support for non-Latin characters in file names.
  + Fixed file versions being left behind in the file system after a file is being deleted, either directly or via the trash folder.
  + Fixed reloading current folder on rename.
  + Fixed listing user activity logs for independent admins.
  + Labels and other metadata not showing for files in the search results, when searching just by filename.
  + Fixed deleting metadata file types.
  + Users can no longer create/upload folders with names that makes them hidden (for example folders with names starting with a dot character), nor they can create/upload files with names that makes them hidden (such as ".htaccess", ".DS\_Store", or if a custom hidden pattern is configured for the user/group/role).
    This applies to any method: user interface, API, WebDAV, sync clients.
  + Fixed exporting user activity logs when specifying a date range.
  + The "Link Opener" plugin which allows you to upen .URL (Internet bookmarks) files now opens the links in separate windows, as most websites block frames nowdays.
  + Fixed display of file owner group name under the file control panel.
  + Fixed folder listing when locating a file from the search result when the file is located in the root folder of the search.
  + Fixed display of large lists of file tags in the file details panel.
  + The videos media folder is now hidden for users without download permissions.
  + Collections tree option is no longer shown when the user doesn't have download permission.
* #### Other changes

  + New web links that have an expiration date, will expire at the end of the specified day, rather than the beginning. This does not apply to existing web links.
  + Files and folders can now be moved inside a folder shared without download permission. The purpose is to allow file management for uploading files in an organized way, while still preventing the users from moving files from a folder without download permissions to a folder with download permissions.
  + 'Thumbs.db' is no longer a hidden file.
  + The control panel now opens in a new window and its various sections can be bookmarked for quick access.
  + "cron/paths\_cleanup.php" can now take the following arguments:

    --deep Cleans all data related to the cleaned/removed file paths. This includes: shares, web links, metadata, comments, labels, stars, file activity logs, thumbnail caches, old file versions, search indexes, previews, etc.

    --aggressive Cleans also files that might exist and are accessible by their paths, but their paths are not perfect (for example, using back slashes or multiple consecutive forward slashes).

    --remove-hidden Cleans from FileRun database files and folders that start with a dot character.

    --path /your/path Limit the process to a particular folder.
  + Deprecated config options: $config['app']['weblinks']['show\_page\_before\_download']

## November 21, 2020 (2020.11.21)

* **Improvements**
  + Multiple files and folders can be now shared with other FileRun users at the same time.
    Do note that changing the sharing setting for multiple items at the same time, will apply the exact same settings to all files and folders and override any other existing sharing options.
  + Added "LibreOffice Viewer" plugin which can generate browser-friendly previews for Microsoft Office and OpenOffice type documents. The previews are generated on first view, then cached on the server just as thumbnails are, so subsequent previews open without delay. Requires that LibreOffice is installed on the server, and path configured under the FileRun control panel section "Thumbnails and preview".
  + Users can now share files metadata via web links. You can choose to prevent sharing of certain fields, by editing the metadata fields options from the FileRun control panel.
  + Direct links to files and folders can be copied to clipboard via the contextual menu (under "More options..") or from the sharing panel. These links can be shared with other FileRun users that have access to the file, for pointing to a particular file or folder while collaborating.
  + Users can now search for files that have a metadata value equal or larger/lower than a particular numerical value. For example, to list all files rated 3 stars or lower, one would search for "Rating: 3-". To list all files rated 4 stars or higher, one would search for "Rating: 3+".
  + Files and folders can be rated with keyboard shortcuts by selecting one item and pressing a key from 0 to 5.
  + PDF documents are now handled by the browser on the mobile devices. This means that, if the browser can open the file, it will open it directly, if not, it will prompt the user to save the file to the device before opening with a native app.
  + Added "Videos" display mode, which shows only the video files in the current file list.
  + Added "Videos" media folder which lists the videos in the user's home folder, sorted by the date the files where uploaded to FileRun.
  + Added "Last uploaded" section under "Photos". It shows any type of image file sorted by the date it was uploaded to FileRun.
  + Added "[All]" folder under "Photos > By Date > Year" to list all photos taken that particular year, instead of browsing each month separately.
  + A metadata field can now offer multiple predefined options of which the user can select multiple ones. For that, create fields of type "Multiple values" and you will get the option of setting predefined values the user can select from.
  + Added support for uploading high resolution screenshots via pasting even when the server is configured with small upload limits.
  + One user's list of shared folders is now sorted in a natural way.
  + The comments input field is resizable for writing larger comments more comfortable.
  + Improved compatiblity with the latest version of SimpleSAMLphp. Also made it so that local FileRun user accounts can login, as altenative to SimpleSAMLphp SSO. Added an option to import group names returned by SimpleSAMLphp and an option to restrict access to only certain groups.
  + Added control panel option, under "Interface options", to hide the "Download All" button from folders shared by web links.
  + Non-image files now open with their own preview, instead of just showing a thumbnail, under folders shared via web links as image galleries.
  + Opening HTML files in a new tab now adds HTTP security headers to block forms, JavaScript and other HTTP requests, to prevent XSS attacks.
* **Fixes**
  + Fixed Office Web Viewer plugin.
  + The "Photos" media library section no longer shows files which are of a different file type than "Photos" or no type. This is to prevent for example a scan of a document to be shown as a photo.
  + Fixed bug preventing users from changing their passwords while 2FA is enabled.
  + File activity log not displaying when browser extensions for ad blocking, such as uBlock, are enabled.
  + Improved handling of short MySQL wait timeouts, causing database connectivity problems when users download larger files or over slow network connections.
  + Fixed login page redirecting to SSO when "Allow local user accounts to login" is unchecked even though SSO is not enabled.
  + Fixed the "Shares" section under a file's or folder's control panel not listing shares on the item itself but only for contained items.
  + Fixed choosing users and groups for sending files via e-mail.
  + Fixed bug preventing users from creating file requests without being password protected.
  + Fixed Zoho Editor plugin error when FileRun user name contains non-Latin characters.
  + Fixed error message while using Zoho Editor plugin.
  + Fixed error when trying to make thumbnails for broken PNG files.
  + Copying and moving files (not folders) inside another user's home folder, from the current user's home folder, now logs the receiving actions, for sending notifications.
  + Added compatibility with Bitly V4 API.
  + When setting manual notifications for "Folder received (via copy)" and for "Folder received (via move)", the messages now include details about the folder name and location and the name of the user that provided the folder.
  + Fixed regression bug: selecting multiple items in the list of files was not updating the details panel properly.
  + Fixed memory limit hitting when running the "cron/paths\_cleanup.php" script.
  + Web link records are no longer automatically cleaned if the file/folder is not found. This is to prevent loss of web links in case the storage is temporarily inaccessible.
  + Improved display of Markdown content in comments and from files.
  + Previewing older versions of the same file with ONLYOFFICE now opens the appropriate version.
  + Fixed incorrect space quota calculation, showing wrong information in the user interface and preventing chunked uploads to complete successfully.
  + Fixed possible error regarding failing to create subfolders when a race condition happens when uploading folders.
  + The "Connected apps" section of the personal settings panel is no longer displayed if the API is disabled.
  + Fixed bug leaving empty upload temporary folders when Nextcloud apps are being used to upload larger files.
  + Fixed ability of setting different permissions to different users/groups when sharing a file/folder for the first time.
  + Various smaller UI fixes and improvements.

## December 25, 2019 (2019.12.25)

* **File Control Panel**
  + It's a per file/folder control panel available only for the FileRun superuser.
  + It provides a central place for retrieving additional information in relation to a file or a folder and provides tools for troubleshooting FileRun features such as the content indexing, metadata extraction and thumbnail and preview generation.
  + The contextual menu option "More options.." > "Index files" is now an option under the File Control Panel.
  + The plugin "Admin: Text Indexer Test" is now an option under the File Control Panel.
  + The plugin "Admin: Thumbnail troubleshooter" is now an option under the File Control Panel.
* **Folder Notifications**
  + Added control panel option for automatically subscribing users so that they receive notifications when files, comments or labels are being added inside folders that have been shared with them. The option is available under "Files" > "Misc options".
  + The folder notification options are now split into the following:
    - "New files" -> If the previous option titled "Upload, Delete, Rename, etc." was enabled, it now only covers new files. For getting notifications on deletes, renames, etc. the users now need to manually change the notification options to include the new "Other actions" option. The FileRun update will not enable this automatically for the existing settings.
    - "New comments and labels"
    - "Downloads and previews" -> This is the previous option titled "Download, Preview, Copy, etc."
    - "Other actions"
* **Thumbnails and image preview**
  + The generated image previews are now cached on the server.
  + Added option to choose the resolution of the image previews and even allowed image files to be served as they are.
  + Image previews are now loading with lower resolution on non-retina displays.
  + Added support for the IMagick PHP extension for generating thumbnails using ImageMagick when PHP doesn't have permission to run external programs. Useful for shared hosting environments.
  + Additional options for controling the behavior of thumbnail and preview generation have been added to the control panel, under "Interface" > "Thumbnails and preview".
  + Added option to rotate previews in the image viewer.
  + The same preview system and cached images are now also used when previewing images via shared web links opened in "Image gallery" mode.
  + The gallery web links image viewer now supports non web-safe images as well, so you can share folders with raw photographs as galleries that include larger previews.
  + To generate previews from the command line, you can use the script cron> php make\_thumbs.php --username admin --size large.
  + Fixed clearing thumbnail cache via the folder properties panel when a custom cache location is configured.
  + Fixed generating thumbnails via command line (cron/make\_thumbs.php).
  + If the Google Static Maps API key is set, FileRun will generate thumbnails for GPX files.
* **Authentication**
  + Users can now generate additional credentials to be used with third-party WebDAV apps. The option is available under the "Account settings" panel. This is particularly useful when connecting using the WebDAV protocol and your FileRun user account uses 2-Step verification (2FA). (Note that this feature requires the API to be enabled.)
  + Authenticating to FileRun via OAuth2 now works with authentication plugins that use SSO (Single sign-on).
  + Added the possiblity to limit users login to more than one IP address or range. "$config['app']['login']['restrict\_ip'][$USERNAME]" can now be an array of IP addresses or ranges.
  + No longer logging failed login attempts when the user is setting up 2FA or being asked for the 2FA code.
  + Failed login attempts made from unauthorized IP addresses are now logged to the user activity log.
  + Failed logins not attributed to a particular user account are now logged as well to the user activity log, under the FileRun superuser account. Paricularly useful to see when invalid usernames are being used or various other errors from a third-party authentication plugin are happening.
* **Nextcloud apps**
  + Added compatiblity with the version 2.6 of the Nextcloud desktop app.
  + Fixed synching shared folders with Nextcloud desktop sync.
  + Fixed synching folder renames for Nextcloud apps.
  + Nextcloud desktop app showing avatar on account.
  + Nextcloud desktop app allowing to open a file/folder in the FileRun web UI. (Note that this currently doesn't work for shared items but only for items inside a FileRun user's home folder.)
* **Activity Panel**
  + The activity panel is now available for the currently opened folder and also for files.
  + Added config option ($config['app']['folder\_activity']['show\_own'] = true;) for enabling own actions to be listed in the Folder Activity panel.
  + Added config option ($config['app']['folder\_activity']['show\_all\_actions'] = true;) for disabling grouping of actions in the Folder Activity panel by file.
  + Fixed functionality of the "Folder Activity" panel when enabled for shared folders.
* **User Interface**
  + The default view mode using for web links can now be changed from the control panel (Interface > Options). Changing the default mode affects all existing web links, unless they were specifically shared with a view mode other than the default one. Web links that were shared with the parameter "mode" in the URL will not be affected.
  + Added file size information for the files shared via "List view" links.
  + The width of the folder panel is now being remembered on the same computer accross sessions.
  + Links to files from the e-mail notifications are now opening the FileRun user interface with highlighting the file.
  + Enabling/disabling or making changes to the FileRun plugins no longer requires users to clear their browser's cache in order to see the change.
  + Clicking a file's label in the details panel will search the current folder for all files with that label.
  + Clicking to "locate" a file from a search results it now closes the search panel, instead of performing another search inside the found file's folder.
  + Text from the Control Panel grids can now be selected for copying.
  + Fixed bug causing the file list to scroll up when clicking next to a file.
  + The text editor now allows copying, pasting and text selection on mobile devices.
  + Making any changes to metadata fields, field sets or file types will reflect immediately, without the users needing to clear their browsers' cache.
  + You can hide the list of system default metadata file types (Audio, Documents, Photos, Videos) in the metadata file type search by setting "$config['app']['metadata']['search']['exclude\_system\_filetypes'] = true;".
  + You can hide the list of system default metadata fields (the ones that belong to the "Audio", "Documents", "Photos", "Videos" file types) in the metadata file search by setting "$config['app']['metadata']['search']['exclude\_system\_fields'] = true;".
  + The metadata fields with predefined lists of values now offer the user the option of setting no value.
  + Metadata field sets are now sorted alphanumerically based on their names.
  + The metadata field type "Date/time" now shows a calendar for choosing a value. The field expects the format "2019-01-29 23:59:59".
  + Fix: The login form no longer moves out of the screen when typing in credentials on mobile devices.
  + Fixed "Open with.." > "New tab" to allow multiple files to be left opened at the same time.
  + Fixed Autodesk plugin opening in a new window.
  + Fixed avatar letters being wrong in some cases.
  + Fixed downloading file from the image viewer by pressing the Enter key.
  + Fixed group avatar when group name contains multibyte characters (non-latin characters)
  + Fixed: keyboard shortcuts on Firefox (non-Windows).
  + Fixed sharing panel UI glitch preventing users with long names to be removed from a share.
  + Fixed folder notification messages to include users' full names.
  + Various other small UI improvements and fixes.
* **Other Improvements**
  + Added control panel option for disabling/hiding the "Collections" feature. This applies system-wide.
  + The ONLYOFFICE plugin is now available for all filetypes support by ONLYOFFICE, rather than only the common office documents. The full list is the following: "doc", "docx", "dotx", "odt", "ott", "rtf", "txt", "pdf", "html", "epub", "xps", "djvu", "xls", "xlsx", "xltx", "ods", "ots", "csv", "ppt", "pptx", "potx", "odp", "otp".
  + The ONLYOFFICE plugin supports JWT authentication.
  + The ONLYOFFICE plugin no longer autosaves changes. The user needs to click "File" -> "Save" or use the keyboard shortcut for the changes to be saved to the document.
  + Change: the upload chunk size is no longer limited to a max of 20MB but instead it is determined automatically based on the PHP configured "upload\_max\_filesize" and "post\_max\_size" (the smallest of these two values). This has two important consequences. One is a potentially negative one, smaller files will be reuploaded from the start if the transfer is interrupted or paused (interrupted downloads are being resumed from the last uploaded chunk). The second consequence, is a positive one, with large files uploaded over fast connections will be uploaded much faster than before (particularly noticeable in local networks). The chunk size can still be manually using '$config['app']['upload']['chunk\_size']' (see https://docs.filerun.com/advanced\_configuration).
  + Changing a folder's notifications options is now logged to the user activity log.
  + Adding/removing a user to/from a group is now logged to the user activity log.
  + Sending files/folders via e-mail, using web links, now logs the action of creating the web link.
  + Saving changes on a web link's settings is no longer logged as an action if no changes were actually made.
  + $config['app']['email\_notification']['per\_item']['limit\_actions'] is an array containing a list of actions that notifications are being triggered when using per folder notifications.
  + Apache Tika in server mode now requires version 1.22.
  + Added options for enabling file indexing for image files and scanned PDFs through OCR. It requires Tesseract. For more informatiom please see https://docs.filerun.com/file\_indexing
  + Added option for loading a configuration file for Apache Tika.
  + The text editor can now open GPX and KML files, with XML code highlighting.
  + E-mail notifications for uploading and downloading empty files are no longer instant. This allows users to create new text files and add content to them without having too many notification messages being sent about the particular activity.
  + The control panel export function for the user activity logs search results is now triggering a file download rather than saving the file in the superuser's home folder. The activity details are now json encoded.
  + Added API method for changing the password.
  + Added possiblity of specifying additional options for connecting to the MySQL database by editing "system/data/autoconfig.php" and adding the 'options' element which lists PDO predefined constants.
  + File or folder names that end with a space or a dot character are no longer allowed.
  + Users with the permission to share files with other FileRun users can now share their entire home folders.
* **Other Fixes**
  + Fixed: Removing a user from a group leaving behind settings attached to files/folders shared with the group.
  + Fixed: Removing a user from a shared folder leaving behind settings attached to the files/folders. For example, per-folder notifications enabled, having the users that no longer have access to the shared folder to still receive related notifications.
  + Fixed regression bug: superuser not being able to assign users or groups using the "Can interact with" permissions.
  + Fix: allow "memory limit hitting fatal error" to be logged to the PHP error log when trying to process Exif data from very large files.
  + Fix: FileRun no long attempts to read Exif data from PSD/PSB files.
  + Fixed compatiblity with the newer Autodesk API to allow opening CAD files.
  + Fixed problem with browsing shared folders with certain WebDAV programs.
  + Fixed PHP warning when importing users via CSV.
  + Fixed PHP error (*Call to undefined function FileRun\Utils\xdebug\_get\_function\_stack() ..*) when installing FileRun updates.
  + Fixed extracting tar.gz archives.
  + Fixed "cron/metadata\_index.php" not processing all users when ran without paramaters.
  + Fixed delay in reflecting changed control panel settings when PHP OPcache is enabled.
  + Fixed error when accessing collections that are supposed to contain files that were removed from outside FileRun.
  + Fixed problem with HTML characters typed in the message when sending files via e-mail.

## July 01, 2019 (2019.06.01)

#### New features:

* ##### 3D model file support

  + Added 3D viewer with support for: OBJ/MTL, STL, FBX, DAE, X, GLTF/GLB, 3DS, 3MF.
  + It supports external resources (texture files located in the same folder).
  + It provides the option of saving screenshots from the renders.
  + Added icon and file type description for various 3D model files.
  + Added option to use <https://github.com/unlimitedbacon/stl-thumb> for generating thumbnails for STL 3D models.
* Added back the download cart. It is hidden by default and it can be enabled from the control panel, under "Interface" -> "Options".
* Added the possiblity of setting custom icons to specific folders. See [this page](https://feedback.filerun.com/communities/1/topics/237-custom-folder-icons) for more details.

#### Fixes:

* Fixed several medium and low risk security vulnerabilities.
* Regression fix: Sharing as a link a sub folder of a shared folder would share the parent folder instead. (The current FileRun version has been patched shortly after release.)
* Added "index.html" files to prevent web servers from listing various FileRun application folders.
* Fixed emojis in filenames affecting thumbnail display mode.
* Fixed PHP warning when FileRun user is changing own password.
* Fix: Simple admin users unable to change passwords for the existing user accounts.
* Fixed folder listing sorting in the main UI.
* Fix: Filename with non-ASCII characters on file download on Edge.

* Better handling of non-ASCII characters for generating user avatars.
* Fixed the progress bar UI on the upload panel.
* Fixed various UI glitches.

- Other changes
  * Change: Due to security reasons, FileRun no longer allows filesystem paths/filenames that contain the < or > characters.
  * To prevent getting locked out, the superuser account now has 20 failed login attempt until the account is locked, regardless of the settings for the other user accounts. Make sure you set a secure password for the user account.
  * Behavior change: Closing the "Web Link" panel using the "Done" button no longer copies the URL to clipboard. Users have to press the "Copy" button instead.
  * Added field for setting the name e-mail notifications are being sent from.
  * Added informative notification when assigning the same home folder path to more than one user account.

## May 22, 2019 (2019.05.21)

#### Important notes

* Making a backup of the FileRun installation before installing updates is highly recommended. Read [here](http://docs.filerun.com/backup) how.
* The minimum required PHP version for this update is **7.1**. For best performance and security, we highly recommend PHP 7.2 or 7.3. The PHP versions 5.6 and 7.0 reached end-of-life from PHP developers, which means no security updates are being released for them. For the safety of your data, FileRun no longer supports them either. (Please see [this guide](http://docs.filerun.com/php7) for upgrading to PHP 7.1+.)
* This update breaks compatibility with the FileRun Android app, which will need updating. Please note that a compatible FileRun Android app might not be yet available.
* Using the desktop sync apps or the Nextcloud Android app is now requiring the FileRun API to be enabled. Read [here](https://docs.filerun.com/api#enabling_the_api) how to enable it.
* After this update, the default language will be set to "English" and the installation will have no translations. The translation system has changed and any files previously uploaded to "system/data/languages" will be removed by this update. For adding translations, please see: <https://docs.filerun.com/translating_filerun>
* Users without the permission "*User can make changes to files and folders*", can no longer make copies of files/folders, even if they have the "User can upload files and folders" permission.
* The config option "$config['app']['thumbs']['output\_small\_filesize']" changed to "$config['thumbs']['output\_small\_max\_filesize']".
* The configuration option "$config['app']['ui']['custom\_css\_url']" is no longer active or available. For customizations, please create the file "customizables/theme.css" and enabled it from the control panel under "Branding".
* The download cart feature has been removed. Please use the new collections feature or the starring feature to achieve the same.
* The "Creative Cloud" and "Pixlr" plugins have been removed as the services have been discontinued by their developers.

#### New features

* ### Collections

  + Files and folders can be added to virtual folders called collections.
  + Same file or folder can be added to more than one collection.
  + Entire collections can be downloaded with a single click.
  + Multiple collections can be downloaded at the same time with a single click.
  + Collections can be dragged into each other to add items from one collection to another. (The original collections will still preserve the same items.)
  + Collections can be shared using web links. All options still apply:
    - You can share the collections as image galleries or audio playlists, password protect the access, etc.
    - You can enable file requests (ie. allow uploads from visitors), and all the folders contained in the collection will allow uploads. If the option "Allow visitors to see and download the existing files." is not enabled, the visitors will not have access to the folders contents, but only be able to upload new files.
  + Files and folders can be renamed or moved, yet they will still remain in the collections to which they were added.
  + Pro tip: use the search to locate files of interest, and add them to a collection, right from the search result.
  + Pro tip #2: Share the same file/folder via multiple weblinks with different options, by placing them into collections and sharing the collections instead.
  + Note: Collections can currently only contain files and folders from the user's own home folder and not from folders shared by other users.
* ### Image editor

  + Basic functionality: resize, crop, rotate, flip.
  + Has no third-party requirements.
  + All types of image files can be opened, as FileRun will convert the data format if necessary. Note, very large image files will be converted to a maximum resolution of 4000x4000 pixels. Editing a RAW image file, for example, will save the edited version as a separate JPG image.
  + Can be used to convert various images file formats to JPG.
  + The image viewer has a button shortcut for opening the current image in the editor.
* ### Added Laravel authentication plugin.
* ### Added dark theme.
* PDF documents can be edited with Google Docs Editor.

#### API

* Added API method for removing web links (<http://docs.filerun.com/api#removing_web_links>).
* Fixed weblink information when listing via the API files and folders with weblinks.w
* The API endpoint **user/info** provides now also information about the user's permissions.

#### Various

* **Many performance improvements, making FileRun significantly quicker to load and react.**
* **Added compatibility with latest Nextcloud Android and desktop apps.**
* Added configuration option for the LDAP plugin, to limit access only to users that are members of particular groups.
* The activity logs for files and folders can now be checked also for items from the trash folder.
* ### User Interface

  + Improvements for mobile browser access:
    - The default display mode is "Detailed list" and the control panel set display mode applies only on large screen devices. The user can still change the display mode at any time.
    - All inner popups open full screen. Users can rotate device to landscape for better use of wider content.
    - Increased various text and element sizes for better accessibility.
    - Improved the image viewer's details panel.
    - Fix size of the Android app login prompt.
  + Added support for LibreOffice for generating thumbnails for office documents, including plain text files and HTML. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice#Supported_file_formats>)
  + Added breadcrumbs navigation which shows the path of the currently browsed folder and provides a quick way of browsing to the parent folders.
  + Added blank theme for custom themeing.
  + The custom theme file now loads on top of the selected color theme. To customize an existing theme, enable the option "Apply "customizables/theme.css"" and create the file "customizables/theme.css" where you write your custom CSS code.
  + **Target folder selector**
    - Shows a small window for browsing existing folders for performing various actions.
    - It is used for copying or moving files and folders. The copy/paste option has been replaced by this feature.
    - It is used also for extracting archives to specific locations.
  + The web page's title gets updated based on the browsed folder. This helps identify between multiple opened tabs and improve bookmarking.
  + **Thumbnails**
    - Narrower thumbnails are now displayed from the top instead from the center. This makes identifying text documents easier.
    - File icons are now monochrome, to better distinguish between system icons and thumbnails.
    - Improved browser caching for thumbnails sent out from original file contents.
    - Improved the loading speed from the server for cached thumbnails.
    - Thumbnails are displayed now also for very small image files (smaller than 1KB). This is useful for small SVG icons, or plain text files without much content.
    - Better cache handling for files that thumbnail generation fails or provides no output. For example, FileRun tries to generate cover images for MP3 files. Before, even if a file wasn't having one, the server was looking into the file for one, every time the user was listing the file. Now it doesn't.
    - Small SVG files no longer employ ImageMagick for thumbnail generation but instead they are displayed natively.
    - Default thumbnail size has been increased from 140 pixels to 170.
    - Added lazy-loading for thumbnails displayed via weblinks.
  + Searching: choosing a metadata field that has a predefined list of options now shows the actual list to the user.
  + The refresh button is now on the top toolbar, for easier access.
  + The meta-icons have been moved to allow longer file and folder names to display better.
  + Added keyboard shortcut "n" (or "N") for creating a new folder.
  + The "Locate" context menu option now shows for items in the search result.
  + Failed actions now show a red colored message in the left-bottom corner of the screen, to inform the user that there was a problem.
  + Restoring files from trash updates only the changes instead of reloading the trash file list.
  + Added option for (calculating and) viewing folder sizes.
  + Dragging files up and down the grid automatically scrolls the list.
  + Added automatic scrolling when dragging items to the folders tree.
  + Dragging folders from the tree panel is no longer enabled to prevent accidental folder moves. Moving folders is now done only by dragging from the grid.
  + When dragging files and folders around, it's now clearer to see what files/folders are being dragged.
  + Fix: the rating and tags widgets are no longer displayed for users that do not have permission to access metadata.
  + Fix: file list scroll when playing an audio file from a display mode other than "Music".
  + Various other interface improvements and fixes.
* Desktop sync
  + Fixed uploading new files. The error message was "*The server did not acknowledge the last chunk. (No e-tag was present)*".
  + Fixed uploading files inside the home folder (@Home). The error message was "*Not allowed because you don't have permission to add files in that folder*".
* ï»¿Added option to preview old file versions. Versions open in separate browser tabs for easy comparison. They open with the default configured file preview method. If the default file preview method is an editor, saving changes will not update the old version, but it will save it as the current version.
* Files can be permanently deleted (skipping the trash folder) by holding the shift key when performing the action.
* Security: The option "Maximum login attempts" applies now also when a third-party authentication plugin is in use, preventing brute force attacks.
* The admin users can now reset a user's 2-step verification. Useful in case of lost devices.
* Fix: removed limitation on number of users and groups that can be listed inside the "Can interact with" user permission.
* Fix: loading high-res version of images in folders with single quote characters in their names.
* Fix: adding files to an existing Zip archive no longer resets the archive file, so weblinks and other metadata already attached to the archive get preserved.
* Fix: extracting files from a Zip archive, if they overwrite existing files, it no longer resets the target files, so weblinks and other metadata already attached to the existing files get preserved.
* Fix: The option of sharing a web link via QR-code is now enabled by default. (The optional config "$config['app']['weblinks']['showQRCode']" is now called "$config['app']['weblinks']['hideQRCode']".)
* Fixed "User info HTTP method" option not being taken into consideration for the OAuth2 authentication plugin.
* Fix SSO not setting a CSRF token causing users to be unable to delete files or the admin to make changes in the control panel. Affects only the cases where "Inactivity timeout" is set to 0.
* Fix ImageMagick crash when $config['imagemagick\_limit\_resources'] is enabled.
* Added plugin for troubleshooting the thumbnail generation process. The plugin is available only to the FileRun superuser and disabled by default.
* Added config option $config['app']['enable\_catch\_all\_event']. Set to true, will have FileRun look for "customizables/events/catch-all.php" and run it every time a user performs an action.
* Fix: trying to move a folder to the same location ends with an error message instead of renaming the folder to "Copy of ..".
* Improvement: when a file/folder move attempt fails, the user now gets to know to which of the selected files/folders the returned error refers to.
* Fix: error listing user accounts when the option "Inactive accounts" is set to "Do not delete" under the guest user settings.
* Improvement: when trying to empty the trash folder, if there is an item with errors, the operation will continue with the remaining of the files rather than stop there.
* Fix: user self registration process wasn't registering the user details (Phone, Company, Website) correctly.
* Raw image files 'cr2', 'mos', 'mef', 'nef', 'arw', '3fr', 'iiq', if they don't have an XMP sidecar file, are processed as TIFF for extracting basic Exif data (width, height and date taken).
* Added 'webp' image file format support and it is handled as a web-safe image (just as JPG or PNG). Note that at this time, Safari, the old Internet Explorer, the old Firefox versions and Edge versions 12-17, do not support this file format.
* Fixed error message when trying to import users from a file without mapping both first and last name columns.
* Added AIF, AIFF, 7Z, DCM as recognizable file formats.
* Removed FLV and SWF video playback support.
* Fixed full-screen on EPUB reader on Chrome.
* Added support for vertical languages EPUB books.
* 'file.download' hook has been renamed to 'file.read'
* 'file.upload' hook has been renamed to 'file.write' and it executes before the file is write but after all the needed information has been collected (does not include file contents data). To target particular types of file writing, there are the available hook names "file.write.string", "file.write.upload", "file.write.move", "file.write.copy"
* Other changes
  + File downloads (regardless of method - which includes opening a file in the browser for viewing, previewing a bit of a media file, etc.) no longer logs the action to FileRun's activity logs and the per-file activity logs, unless the very end part of the file's contents has been transfered from the server to the client. This is done to avoid thousands of log entries caused by Firefox and other browser that might make very large number of small partial requests when downloading a file. This change means that if a user opens an audio file or video file and doesn't wait until the entire file gets downloaded, the action will not be logged on the server. If this is not a desired behavior for your particular use-case, you can change back to the previous behavior, by adding "$config['app']['logging']['partial\_downloads'] = true;" inside "customizables/config.php" (<http://docs.filerun.com/advanced_configuration>
  + The config options "$config['app']['api']['oauth2']['allow\_over\_http'] = true;" is no longer available, with the option now added to the FileRun control panel.

# Like Google Drive, but private!

### and under your full control

Runs *very fast* on any hardware: Linux, Windows, VPS, Shared hosting, NAS, etc.
![](images/screenshot_2024.png)

#### No import required

Just like you do with an FTP server, point FileRun to where you keep the files on your server, and you will get instant web access to them.

Want to access your files also by other means you have configured (such as FTP or SMB for example)? No problem. Upload, download or manage the same files.

All changes made to the files using FTP or other methods reflect via FileRun without delay.

#### Desktop sync

Sync files using [desktop apps](./download).

Access your files from wherever you are using the [compatible mobile apps](https://docs.filerun.com/mobile_apps).

Access via [WebDAV](https://docs.filerun.com/webdav). FileRun comes with its own embedded WebDAV server. No server configuration needed.

#### Great for photos

Fast thumbnail and preview generation. On the fly, while browsing folders.

Timeline browsing, sorting photos and videos cronologically.

Supports all file types that you can think of, video files included.

Group photos together, from various folders, in virtual albums that you can share online.

#### Metadata support

It automatically extracts and index information Exif, XMP and IPTC, so you can search photos by keywords, dates, author and more.

Add custom metadata fields for any additional information you would like to attach to the pictures. This information can either be automatically extracted from the files, or manually typed by you.

#### Virtual Drive

The new virtual drive gives you access to files directly from your computer, without impacting all of your disk space.

Spend less time waiting for files to sync and more time being productive.

![](images/2021/virtual-drive.jpg)

#### Guest users

Collaborate with other people without creating accounts for them.

Getting feedback on documents, photos or any type of file has never been this easy.

[Read more about this feature](http://blog.filerun.com/guest-users-file-sharing-simplified-2/)

#### Send file requests

File requests allow you to collect and receive files from anyone, right into your FileRun user account, with just a link.

File requests are ideal for receiving a large file or collection of files, collecting photos after a special event, and requesting submissions from coworkers and clients.

#### Various plugins:

##### Google Docs Editor

Create and edit Office files.

##### Zoho Editor

Create, edit and preview Office files.

##### ONLYOFFICE

##### Image editor

Crop, resize and rotate images. Adjust their brightneess/contrast/saturation and more.

#### Fantastic mobile support

Nothing to install, just open FileRun in your mobile browser.

It adapts to screens of any size to provide a smooth and intuitive experience..

It works on tablets and smartphones just like you would expect from a native app.

Fast loading, easy browsing, while preserving all the powerful features.

![](images/2021/screenshot_mobile.jpg)

#### Extendable

PHP web developers can develop plugins for viewing, creating or manipulating files.

The [OAuth2-secured API](http://docs.filerun.com/api) can be used for programmatically interacting with FileRun, or creating more apps for accessing your files.

#### Safe

The automatic file versioning system prevents you from accidentally overwriting existing files.

Deleted files first end up in a trash folder before they get permanently erased.

#### 100% Your branding

Choose one of the included color presets, or customize your own. Background images, colors, logos, all can be customized to match your own branding.

#### Secure

XSS and CSRF protection.

SQL injections protection.

Session Hijacking protection.

Brute force login attempts protection.

The users input is strictly validated to prevent access outside the allowed folders.

The files can be stored outside the public area of the web server (ie. outside the "www" folder) to protect them from direct access.

100% support for HTTPS/SSL.

## PoC - Open Redirect

An open redirect vulnerability exists in FileRun in '**/filerun/images/fico/ext2ico.php?theme=**' URL that allows attackers to redirect users to an arbitrary URL. A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect.

```
