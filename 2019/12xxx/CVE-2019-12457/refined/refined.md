Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-12457:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content directly mentions `CVE-2019-12457` in relation to a directory listing vulnerability.  This confirms the content's relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause of CVE-2019-12457, as well as CVE-2019-12458 and CVE-2019-12459, is the presence of directory listing enabled in the webserver configuration for certain directories within the FileRun application.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **Directory Listing:** The vulnerability is that the webserver configuration did not prevent directory listing of specific directories. This is a common misconfiguration that exposes the contents of a directory structure, including names of files/folders.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain a list of all files and folders located within the exposed directories. This information can be used to gather insights about the software's structure, identify potential vulnerabilities, and locate sensitive files, or possibly be used to construct further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Direct URL Access:** The attacker directly accesses specific URLs, such as `/filerun/images/extjs/`, `/filerun/css/ext-ux/`, or `/filerun/customizables/plugins/audio_player/`, which reveal directory listings due to misconfiguration.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the FileRun instance to directly access the vulnerable URLs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also mentions other CVEs: CVE-2019-12458, CVE-2019-12459, and CVE-2019-12905.
- The content includes PoCs (Proof of Concepts) for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and Open Redirect vulnerabilities.
- The content suggests that the directory listing vulnerability can be remediated by disabling directory listings in the web server configuration or ensuring that these directories do not contain sensitive information.
