Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system through the CLI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with *root* privileges. This grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must have valid credentials to access the CLI.
- The attacker crafts malicious arguments to specific CLI commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated, local user on a vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to be familiar with the CLI and be able to craft specific commands to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco FTD Software running on Cisco Firepower 1000, 2100, 4100, and 9300 Series Appliances.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability besides applying the provided patches.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of these vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 8.8 (High), with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates that the attack requires local access, has low complexity, requires low privileges, does not require user interaction, and has a changed scope with high impacts on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
