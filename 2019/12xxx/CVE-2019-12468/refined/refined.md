Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12468:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how MediaWiki's `Special:ChangeEmail` page handled reauthentication. It was discovered that by directly POSTing to this special page, the reauthentication check could be bypassed. This allowed an attacker to change an account's email address without providing the necessary credentials, potentially leading to account takeover.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is the bypass of the reauthentication step required for email changes.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability also involves a direct object reference where direct POST requests to the special page were not properly checked or secured, allowing an attacker to bypass the usual workflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** The most critical impact is the potential for account takeover. By changing the email address associated with an account, an attacker could then initiate a password reset, gaining full control of the targeted account.
*   **Abuse of User Accounts:** Compromised accounts could then be used for malicious activities, such as vandalism, spamming, or other unauthorized actions within the MediaWiki platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct POST Request:** The attack vector is a direct HTTP POST request to the `Special:ChangeEmail` page. The attacker doesn't need to go through the regular user interface or follow standard links.
*   **Bypass of Normal Workflow:** By directly posting to the page, the attacker circumvents the intended reauthentication steps that should have been enforced.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of the Target URL:** The attacker must know the precise URL of the `Special:ChangeEmail` page to craft a successful attack.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have prior access or authentication to the target account; the vulnerability allows them to exploit the flaw directly.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified after a user account was compromised.
*   A patch was created and deployed on Wikimedia sites.
*   The issue was present since at least the rewrite to use authmanager.
*   The fix involves ensuring that proper authentication and authorization checks are enforced when handling requests to `Special:ChangeEmail`.
*   This issue was addressed in MediaWiki versions 1.27.6, 1.30.2, 1.31.2, 1.32.2, and later.
