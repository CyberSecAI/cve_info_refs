Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12586:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided GitHub repository `Matheus-Garbelini/esp32_esp8266_attacks` explicitly mentions "Proof of Concept of ESP32/8266 Wi-Fi vulnerabilties (CVE-2019-12586, CVE-2019-12587, CVE-2019-12588)". Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2019-12586.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is related to a vulnerability in the EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) client implementation within the ESP32/ESP8266 SDKs. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by a crafted EAP packet which causes a crash of the ESP device. The exact nature of the crafted packet is not described, but the vulnerability occurs during the handling of an EAP authentication sequence.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The primary weakness is an improper handling of specific EAP messages, which results in a crash of the ESP32/8266 devices. It is related to the handling of EAP authentication, which could point to a parsing or memory handling error in the implementation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the ESP32/ESP8266 device to crash and restart. This disrupts the functionality of the device and the services it provides.
    - A vulnerable device repeatedly attempts to connect to the malicious access point, entering a crash-reboot loop, making it unusable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack is performed over-the-air via a malicious Wi-Fi access point.
    - An attacker crafts a specific EAP message and sends it to a vulnerable ESP device that is attempting to authenticate to the access point.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the vulnerable ESP device.
    - The attacker needs the ability to operate a rogue access point and craft malicious EAP packets.
    - The attacker also needs to know the targeted user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub repository contains PoC code for the exploit, including scripts for setting up a malicious access point using `hostapd` that triggers the vulnerability.
- The repository also contains client code for the ESP32 and ESP8266 that demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The provided text highlights that the vulnerability was present in ESP-IDF v4.0-dev-459-gba1ff1692 and NONOS-SDK v3.0-103-g7a31cb7 respectively at the time of discovery, indicating specific vulnerable versions of the SDKs.
- This vulnerability can be used against devices connected to Enterprise Networks.

**Summary**
The provided content offers detailed insights into CVE-2019-12586, describing the vulnerability's root cause, impact, attack vector, and required attacker capabilities. It provides practical proof-of-concept code and guidance for testing the vulnerability.
