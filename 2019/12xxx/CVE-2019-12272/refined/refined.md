{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The web application endpoints `admin/status/realtime/bandwidth_status` and `admin/status/realtime/wireless_status` in OpenWrt LuCI are vulnerable to command injection because they unsafely incorporate user-supplied input into shell commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection (CWE-78)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "By injecting malicious code into the `iface` parameter of the vulnerable endpoints.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the LuCI web interface to exploit this vulnerability. No authentication is needed as per one of the CVSS scores."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided github commit link shows the fix by escaping the `iface` variable via `iface:gsub(\"'\", \"\")`. The vulnerability exists in OpenWrt LuCI versions up to and including 0.10."
