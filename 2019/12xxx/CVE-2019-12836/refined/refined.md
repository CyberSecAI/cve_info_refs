{
  "CVE-2019-12836": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Bobronix JEditor editor before v3.0.6 for Jira allows an attacker to add a URL/Link that can cause forgery of a request to an out-of-origin domain. This, along with the ability to upload HTML files, allows for CSRF.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
      "Unrestricted file upload of .html files"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can forge requests in the context of an authenticated user, potentially leading to session token theft and account takeover.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker uploads a malicious HTML file using JEditor's file upload functionality.",
       "An authenticated user is then tricked into interacting with a link that points to this malicious content, causing the malicious HTML to render in their browser context.",
        "The malicious HTML contains JavaScript that can perform actions on behalf of the authenticated user."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files via JEditor. The attack requires an authenticated user to interact with a malicious link/URL pointing to the malicious HTML content."
  }
