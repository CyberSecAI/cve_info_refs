Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-12865

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a double free in the `cmd_mount` function within the `libr/core/cmd_mount.c` file of the radare2 project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Double Free:** The `cwd` variable, which stores the current working directory, is freed twice under specific conditions. This occurs because the `cwd` pointer is not reset to `NULL` after being freed the first time, leading to a double free when the `cmd_mount` function is called again with an invalid root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Crash:** The double free leads to a crash of the radare2 application.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided information primarily indicates a crash, double frees can sometimes be leveraged for more serious attacks, such as arbitrary code execution. This is not explicitly stated, but is an implied risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Commands:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specific sequences of commands to radare2, exploiting the way `cmd_mount` and related functions handle pathing and file system contexts. Specifically:
    1.  Using `ms` to enter `fs_shell` which duplicates the path.
    2.  Exiting `fs_shell`, which frees the duplicated path but doesn't set the pointer to `NULL`.
    3.  Using `ms UNKNOWN_ROOT` to cause `cmd_mount` to attempt to free the same memory again.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the radare2 command line interface. This suggests an attacker needs to be a user of the tool.
*   **Knowledge of Commands:** An attacker must have knowledge of the `ms` command and how it interacts with the `cmd_mount` function.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs in `libr/core/cmd_mount.c`
*   The `cwd` pointer is allocated using `strdup` in `r_fs_shell_prompt` (`libr/fs/shell.c`).
*   The `cwd` pointer is freed in the `cmd_mount` function.
*   The `cwd` pointer is not reset to NULL after being freed in cmd_mount.
*   The double free happens when a second call to `cmd_mount` occurs after `r_fs_shell_prompt` returns without resetting `cwd`.
*   The fix is suggested to replace `free` with `R_FREE` (a macro that handles freeing and nulling pointers in radare2's memory management).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported by user `mmmdzz` on GitHub.
*   The bug was tracked in Fedora Bugzilla as Bug 1725676.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in radare2 version 3.6.0.
*   The fix was included in a Fedora 30 update.
*   The issue is related to how radare2's file system shell (`fs_shell`) and mounting (`cmd_mount`) functionality handles working directory paths.
