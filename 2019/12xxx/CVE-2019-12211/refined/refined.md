Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12211:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow within the `PluginTIFF.cpp` file of the FreeImage library. It stems from an invalid `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A flawed `memcpy` operation leads to writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the application processing the crafted TIFF image.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** The provided information also indicates that the vulnerability could have an unspecified impact beyond just a denial of service. This could include the potential for arbitrary code execution, although no specifics were given in the provided documents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted TIFF Data:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted TIFF image files.
*   **Remote Attack:** Remote attackers can leverage the vulnerability by enticing a user to process a malicious TIFF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to deliver a malicious TIFF file:** Attackers need to be able to get a victim to open the crafted TIFF file. This could be done through a website, email attachment, or other method of file transfer.
*   **No special system access required**: The attacker does not need access to the system to execute this attack since it involves the user opening the file.

**Summary of information:**

The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the FreeImage library. It occurs due to an invalid memcpy when processing crafted TIFF image files. Attackers can exploit this to cause denial of service or other unspecified impacts. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.
