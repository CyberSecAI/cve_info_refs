Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-12698

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to excessive processing load when handling a specific WebVPN HTTP page request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or resource management when processing specific WebVPN HTTP page requests, leading to excessive CPU utilization.
*   This is categorized as a CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit can lead to increased CPU load on the affected device.
*   This high CPU load can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, resulting in traffic delays through the device, potentially disrupting network services for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   Attackers send multiple WebVPN HTTP page load requests for a specific vulnerable URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, and no special privileges are needed
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WebVPN interface of the targeted device.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory provides indicators of compromise, such as increased CPU usage by the *Unicorn Proxy Thread* process.
*   There are no workarounds to fully address the vulnerability, but rate limiting or using access control lists (ACLs) could mitigate an ongoing attack.
*   The advisory lists fixed software versions for Cisco ASA and FTD Software.
*   The CVSS score is 5.3 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L.
*   A Snort rule (51713) is available to detect exploitation attempts.
