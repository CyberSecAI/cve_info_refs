## CVE-2019-12435

Based on the provided documents, here is the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2019-12435:

**Description:** Samba 4.9.x before 4.9.9 and 4.10.x before 4.10.5 has a NULL pointer dereference in the AD DC DNS management server (dnsserver) RPC server process, leading to Denial of Service. An authenticated user can crash the RPC server process via a NULL pointer de-reference by modifying DNS records and zones.

**Root Cause:** NULL pointer dereference. The vulnerability occurs because Samba incorrectly handles certain RPC messages/zone operations in the AD DC DNS management server.

**Weakness:** Improper handling of RPC messages, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact:** Denial of Service. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vector:** A remote attacker can send specially crafted RPC messages to the Samba AD DC DNS management server.

**Required attacker capabilities:**
- The attacker must be authenticated.
- The attacker needs network access to the Samba service.
- The attacker must have privileges to modify DNS records and zones.

**Affected versions:** Samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.9 and 4.10.x before 4.10.5.

**Mitigation:** The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating to Samba versions 4.9.9 or 4.10.5, or by applying the provided patches. A workaround is to stop the dnsserver task by setting 'dcerpc endpoint servers = -dnsserver' in the smb.conf and restarting Samba.
