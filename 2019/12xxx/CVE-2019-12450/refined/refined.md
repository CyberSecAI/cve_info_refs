Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12450:

**1. Verification:**
The provided documents directly relate to CVE-2019-12450, as indicated in the Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2019:3530), the Red Hat Bugzilla entry (1719141), the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4014-1 and USN-4014-2), the SUSE Bugzilla entry (1137001), and the NetApp Security Advisory (NTAP-20190606-0003). All these sources mention the CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the `file_copy_fallback` function in the `gio/gfile.c` file of the GNOME GLib library. When this function performs a file copy operation, it initially creates the destination file with default (insecure) permissions before setting the correct permissions after the copy is completed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is that the `file_copy_fallback` function does not properly restrict file permissions during the copy operation.
- It creates new files using the default umask, which might be too permissive, rather than preserving the permissions of the source file during the copying process.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** During the copy operation, files might temporarily be accessible to users who would not normally have permissions to view or modify them. This could result in the exposure of sensitive data.
- **Data Integrity Compromise**: Unauthorized users may be able to modify files while copy operation is in progress
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not the main impact, a malicious actor might exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by manipulating the copying process.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves using the `file_copy_fallback` function for file copy operations in the GLib library. This is usually done via a vulnerable application that utilizes this function.
- The attacker needs to trigger a file copy operation using the vulnerable `file_copy_fallback` function within the context of an application using the affected glib2 library.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be in a position to initiate a file copy operation via an application or system using the vulnerable GLib library.
- In a system with multiple users, an attacker who has access to perform a file copy operation using a vulnerable version of glib2 might be able to access files copied by other users, if the permissions are not correctly set immediately.
- Specific conditions within the code are required to trigger the fallback mechanism with incorrect permissions.

**Additional Details:**
- The Red Hat advisory indicates a Moderate severity.
- The issue stems from incorrect handling of file permissions, specifically creating destination files with default, rather than restrictive, permissions during a copy operation.
- The fix involves ensuring that files are copied with restricted permissions (`G_FILE_CREATE_PRIVATE`).
- Multiple products and architectures are affected, across various Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, SUSE and NetApp products.
- Patches are made available by the vendors and often included a backport of the fix to older GLib versions.
- The vulnerability affects applications utilizing the `g_file_copy()` and `file_copy_fallback()` functions provided by the glib2 library.
