Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12222:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `SDL_InvalidateMap` function located in `video/SDL_pixels.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The `SDL_InvalidateMap` function attempts to access memory outside of the allocated bounds, leading to a read access violation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause a segmentation fault (SEGV) leading to program termination. This can result in a denial of service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the SDL2\_image library, specifically when loading a PCX image. This is not directly stated in the CVE description, but is evident in the provided data.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when freeing the surface after the image is loaded, leading to the `SDL_InvalidateMap` function being called and out-of-bounds read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PCX file that triggers the out-of-bounds read when loaded by an application using `SDL2_image` library.
*   The attacker can be in a network position since the crafted file can be provided via network (e.g., as a downloaded file).
*   The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the targeted system, as the vulnerability lies within how `SDL2_image` and the core SDL library free surfaces, specifically in the `SDL_InvalidateMap` function, which suggests an issue triggered when deallocating resources.

**Additional Technical details:**

*   The `SDL_InvalidateMap` function is called when an SDL surface is freed. The vulnerability occurs when the reference count `map->dst->refcount` is decremented.
*   The crash happens on line 979 in `SDL_pixels.c` when `map->dst->refcount` is decremented and checked. It is related to how surfaces are freed after being used with maps.
*   A patch was created to address this issue by casting `bpl` to `size_t` and adding a check for the return value of `calloc`. This patch is present in the provided content (`[PATCH] pcx: cast size and check calloc return value`).

The provided information also indicates that this vulnerability was fixed by updating to SDL2\_image version 2.0.5.
