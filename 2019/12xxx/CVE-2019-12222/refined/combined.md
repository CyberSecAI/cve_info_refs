It was created to ensure that one or more security vulnerabilities are fixed in affected versions of fedora-all.  For comments that are specific to the vulnerability please use bugs filed against the "Security Response" product referenced in the "Blocks" field.  For more information see: <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/TrackingBugs>  When submitting as an update, use the fedpkg template provided in the next comment(s).  This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1732263#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-23 05:47:20 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=medium  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1732262,1732263  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1732263#c2)  Fedora Update System    2019-09-16 19:58:06 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2019-a6bc0fb143 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-a6bc0fb143>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1732263#c3)  Fedora Update System    2019-09-17 01:23:42 UTC  ``` SDL2_image-2.0.5-2.fc29 has been pushed to the Fedora 29 testing repository.

pcx: cast size and check calloc return value
bpl is stored as a signed integer. If it happens to be negative, calloc
will be called with surface->pitch (since bpl < surface->pitch). Later we
call SDL\_RWread(src, buf, bpl, 1). bpl is thus cast to size\_t (becoming a
very large positive value), leading to obvious oob write.
We should fail early in this case. It doesn't make sense to continue
processing such files with corrupted bpl.
+ (size\_t) cast bpl in SDL\_max so that it is preferred over surface->pitch
if it is negative
+ check calloc return value to catch allocation failures
+ make sure we don't free unallocated buf in done section

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5052 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5052)

#### Description

An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file in SDL2\_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.
