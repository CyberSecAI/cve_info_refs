Based on the provided release notes, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2019-12926:

**CVE-2019-12926:** This CVE is related to **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities in MailEnable's webmail interface.**

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The release notes indicate multiple XSS vulnerabilities, including reflected and persistent types, within the webmail component. The specific root cause is not described in detail, but they are likely related to improper handling and sanitization of user-supplied input within the webmail application, allowing execution of arbitrary Javascript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

- Reflected XSS: Vulnerabilities where the malicious script is injected into a request and reflected back to the user's browser.
- Persistent XSS: Vulnerabilities where the malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and is then rendered to other users when they access the affected page.
- BAC vulnerabilities: This likely refers to a "Broken Access Control" vulnerability, which is related to XSS as it impacts user authorization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they visit a compromised page or interact with malicious content.
- This could lead to various impacts, such as:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing a user's session cookies to gain unauthorized access to their account.
    - Phishing: Redirecting the user to a fake login page to steal their credentials.
    - Data theft: Accessing or modifying sensitive data within the webmail application or user's account.
    - Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the webmail interface.
    - Malicious actions: Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Account compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Reflected XSS:** The attacker would need to craft a malicious URL or a form submission that contains the malicious script. The victim would then need to click this link or submit this form.
- **Persistent XSS:** The attacker could inject a malicious script into data that is stored by the application, such as email content, calendar events, contact details or files. Other users viewing these items would then be affected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- For **reflected XSS**, the attacker would need to be able to craft URLs or form submissions with malicious scripts and convince a user to interact with them.
- For **persistent XSS**, the attacker would need to be able to inject the malicious script into the webmail application (e.g., by sending emails with malicious content, creating a calendar item, contact entry, file upload, etc).

**Additional Information from the Content**

- **Multiple Reports:** The release notes indicate that several XSS vulnerabilities were reported by multiple researchers (Mattia Pagliuca, Robert Raducioiu, and Sonny from watchTowr) which suggests a pattern of security issues within webmail.
- **Webmail Specific:** These issues are isolated to the webmail interface and do not seem to extend to other services.
- **Patched:** The notes indicate these issues were fixed, which means the current versions of MailEnable should be secure against these attacks.
