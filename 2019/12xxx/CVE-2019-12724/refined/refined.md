Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12724:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `$_POST['name']` parameter when creating or updating alerts within the Teclib News plugin for GLPI. Specifically, when an alert name contains a quote, the value is not displayed correctly in alert form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the `name` field and stored in the database. This injected code is then executed when the alert form is displayed to other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute within the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected alert form. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the application
  - Phishing attacks
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the GLPI system, specifically when creating or editing alerts in the News plugin.
- The attacker would need to be able to create/edit alerts within the application, and inject malicious javascript into the `name` field

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to create or modify alerts. This usually means that the attacker must have some level of authenticated access to the GLPI system.
- The attacker can be a user who has been granted the permissions to perform these actions.
