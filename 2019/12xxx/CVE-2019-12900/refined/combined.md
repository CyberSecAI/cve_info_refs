=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-19:18.bzip2                                      Security Advisory
                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Multiple vulnerabilities in bzip2

Category:       contrib
Module:         bzip2
Announced:      2019-08-06
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected:      2019-07-04 07:29:18 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
                2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/12.0, 12.0-RELEASE-p9)

                2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/11.2, 11.2-RELEASE-p13)
CVE Name:       CVE-2016-3189, CVE-2019-12900

For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit <URL:<https://security.FreeBSD.org/>>.

I.   Background

The bzip2(1)/bunzip2(1) utilities and the libbz2 library compress and
decompress files using an algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
They are generally slower than Lempel-Ziv compressors such as gzip, but
usually provide a greater compression ratio.

The bzip2recover utility extracts blocks from a damaged bzip2(1) file,
permitting partial recovery of the contents of the file.

II.  Problem Description

The decompressor used in bzip2 contains a bug which can lead to an
out-of-bounds write when processing a specially crafted bzip2(1) file.

bzip2recover contains a heap use-after-free bug which can be triggered
when processing a specially crafted bzip2(1) file.

III. Impact

An attacker who can cause maliciously crafted input to be processed
may trigger either of these bugs.  The bzip2recover bug may cause a
crash, permitting a denial-of-service.  The bzip2 decompressor bug
could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Note that some utilities, including the tar(1) archiver and the bspatch(1)
binary patching utility (used in portsnap(8) and freebsd-update(8))
decompress bzip2(1)-compressed data internally; system administrators should
assume that their systems will at some point decompress bzip2(1)-compressed
data even if they never explicitly invoke the bunzip2(1) utility.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available.

V.   Solution

Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and restart daemons if necessary.

1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

Hash: SHA512
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-19:18.bzip2 Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities in bzip2
Category: contrib
Module: bzip2
Announced: 2019-08-06
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2019-07-04 07:29:18 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/12.0, 12.0-RELEASE-p9)
2019-07-04 07:32:25 UTC (stable/11, 11.3-STABLE)
2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p2)
2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/11.2, 11.2-RELEASE-p13)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-3189, CVE-2019-12900
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The bzip2(1)/bunzip2(1) utilities and the libbz2 library compress and
decompress files using an algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
They are generally slower than Lempel-Ziv compressors such as gzip, but
usually provide a greater compression ratio.
The bzip2recover utility extracts blocks from a damaged bzip2(1) file,
permitting partial recovery of the contents of the file.
II. Problem Description
The decompressor used in bzip2 contains a bug which can lead to an
out-of-bounds write when processing a specially crafted bzip2(1) file.
bzip2recover contains a heap use-after-free bug which can be triggered
when processing a specially crafted bzip2(1) file.
III. Impact
An attacker who can cause maliciously crafted input to be processed
may trigger either of these bugs. The bzip2recover bug may cause a
crash, permitting a denial-of-service. The bzip2 decompressor bug
could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
Note that some utilities, including the tar(1) archiver and the bspatch(1)
binary patching utility (used in portsnap(8) and freebsd-update(8))
decompress bzip2(1)-compressed data internally; system administrators should
assume that their systems will at some point decompress bzip2(1)-compressed
data even if they never explicitly invoke the bunzip2(1) utility.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and restart daemons if necessary.
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:18/bzip2.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:18/bzip2.patch.asc
# gpg --verify bzip2.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/12/ r349717
releng/12.0/ r350643

To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Non-security issues fixed:
- Added the --max-scantime clamscan option and MaxScanTime clamd
configuration option (bsc#1144504).
- Increased the startup timeout of clamd to 5 minutes to cater for the
grown virus database as a workaround until clamd has learned to talk to
systemd to extend the timeout as long as needed (bsc#1151839).
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use the SUSE recommended installation methods
like YaST online\_update or "zypper patch".

## Binary packages built by this source

[bzip2](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/bzip2):
high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities

bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.

Â It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available

Â techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six

Â times faster at decompression.

Â .

Â bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text

Â compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally

Â considerably better than that achieved by more conventional

Â LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM

Â family of statistical compressors.

Â .

Â The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its

Â predecessor, bzip (.bz).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-19:18.bzip2 Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Multiple vulnerabilities in bzip2
Category: contrib
Module: bzip2
Announced: 2019-08-06
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2019-07-04 07:29:18 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/12.0, 12.0-RELEASE-p9)
2019-07-04 07:32:25 UTC (stable/11, 11.3-STABLE)
2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/11.3, 11.3-RELEASE-p2)
2019-08-06 17:09:47 UTC (releng/11.2, 11.2-RELEASE-p13)
CVE Name: CVE-2016-3189, CVE-2019-12900
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The bzip2(1)/bunzip2(1) utilities and the libbz2 library compress and
decompress files using an algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
They are generally slower than Lempel-Ziv compressors such as gzip, but
usually provide a greater compression ratio.
The bzip2recover utility extracts blocks from a damaged bzip2(1) file,
permitting partial recovery of the contents of the file.
II. Problem Description
The decompressor used in bzip2 contains a bug which can lead to an
out-of-bounds write when processing a specially crafted bzip2(1) file.
bzip2recover contains a heap use-after-free bug which can be triggered
when processing a specially crafted bzip2(1) file.
III. Impact
An attacker who can cause maliciously crafted input to be processed
may trigger either of these bugs. The bzip2recover bug may cause a
crash, permitting a denial-of-service. The bzip2 decompressor bug
could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
Note that some utilities, including the tar(1) archiver and the bspatch(1)
binary patching utility (used in portsnap(8) and freebsd-update(8))
decompress bzip2(1)-compressed data internally; system administrators should
assume that their systems will at some point decompress bzip2(1)-compressed
data even if they never explicitly invoke the bunzip2(1) utility.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date,
and restart daemons if necessary.
1) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:18/bzip2.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:18/bzip2.patch.asc
# gpg --verify bzip2.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all daemons that use the library, or reboot the system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/12/ r349717
releng/12.0/ r350643
stable/11/ r349718
releng/11.3/ r350643
releng/11.2/ r350643
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c0)  Ivan Topolsky   2019-09-24 10:56:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 819302](attachment.cgi?id=819302&action=diff "Switching type to simple and starting in foreground") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=819302&action=edit "Switching type to simple and starting in foreground") Switching type to simple and starting in foreground  Over time the database of virus signature by ClamAV has grown substantially, over 6 million entries as of writing this.  The signature themselves aren't simple string pattern matches anymore, some of the signatures require bytecode (which depending on clamd installtion might be JITed during load time of clamd).  So over the three years since [bug #962227](show_bug.cgi?id=962227 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Starting clamd on Raspberry Pi 1B gives timeout"), diminutive low-power devices such as the Raspberry Pi aren't the only ones where clamd's systemd .service times out. It now also happens on some old-ish intel CPUs.  I would kindly ask to reconsider the "WONTFIX" timeout situation.  Either increasing the time-out limits locally for clamd.service (see older raspberry pi thread for suggestion), or alternatively running clamd in foreground and switch the unit type to "simple" (see attached diff).  A signal for reloading the database (instead of plain restarting the daemon) could also help (yet another situation where (re-)startup timeout could happen).  Thank you very much for your consideration. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c1)  Reinhard Max   2019-09-26 11:16:00 UTC  ``` I agree that something should be done about this, but using Type=simple is not the right solution, because it causes clamd.setvice to be considered "up" by systemd when it is not yet able to handle client requets, which might cause followup services to fail.  Also, just increasing the timeout in the packaged service file would not be more than a workaround, because you'll always find a machine that needs more time and OTOH it might cause problems on fast machines if clamd actually hangs, but has to wait for ages before it times out.  The perfect solution for this case would be Type=notify, so that clamd can extend the timeout if it needs more time to process the database, but that requires changes to clamd (see sd_notify(3)).  I've just suggested this change to upstream, so let's see what they say about it.  For the time being I suggest you check how long clamd takes for starting up in your case and set the timeout accordingly to avoid the problems that might arise from using Type=simple. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c2)  Arjen de Korte   2019-10-09 17:25:27 UTC  ``` Since July, the startup time for the clamd service went up by more than 50%, so two days ago I was hit by this too. I kindly ask to reconsider to add TimeoutStartSec=180 to the service file. I fully agree this is not an optimal solution, but we'll probably see more and more people running into this even on not so minimal hardware.  If you're reading this bugreport because you searched Bugzilla for why clamd will suddenly no longer start, the following will fix this for now:  mkdir /etc/systemd/system/clamd.service.d cat > /etc/systemd/system/clamd.service.d/override.conf << EOF [Service] TimeoutStartSec=180 EOF  Increase the timeout if necessary (default is 90 seconds). ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c3)  Arjen de Korte   2019-10-10 19:10:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ivan Topolsky from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c0))  > A signal for reloading the database (instead of plain restarting the daemon) > could also help (yet another situation where (re-)startup timeout could > happen).  I just tried the above. This doesn't really help much:  systemctl reload clamd.service  - 77 seconds to completion systemctl restart clamd.service - 78 seconds to completion  At best reloading will save a second. I don't think this is worth the effort. The culprit here is (re)loading the databases, which is the vast majority of the reload/restart time. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c4)  Ivan Topolsky   2019-10-11 08:44:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Arjen de Korte from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c3)) > (In reply to Ivan Topolsky from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c0)) > I just tried the above. This doesn't really help much: > > systemctl reload clamd.service  - 77 seconds to completion > systemctl restart clamd.service - 78 seconds to completion  Sorry, it's my wrong: I didn't formulate my post clearly enough.  My point isn't to *shave a few seconds* by using a signal. (Again the largest time consumed comes from loading and parsing all the .cvd/.cld files and JITing all the bytecode. The posix process teardown/start-up is insignificant as your tests clearly show).  But instead...  > At best reloading will save a second. {...} which is the vast majority of the reload/restart time.   ...systemd makes a clear distinction between *reload* and *restart*.  Restart is basically a short hand for *stop and then start*. If loading the databases times out, you are again at risk at the "start" failing.  Reload is basically "send some signal to the service and let it do its thing". If loading the database takes a long time, there's no systemd's "start" command that might get failed.  TL;DR: it's not about being faster, it's about avoiding running yet another "start" command that is at risk of timing out.  Sorry for not being clear enough the first time. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c5)  Ivan Topolsky   2019-10-11 08:55:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Reinhard Max from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c1)) > The perfect solution for this case would be Type=notify, so that clamd can > extend the timeout if it needs more time to process the database, but that > requires changes to clamd (see sd_notify(3)). >  > I've just suggested this change to upstream, so let's see what they say > about it.   That would be great, it's indeed the perfect solution.  I hope that upstream will think about it.  On the other hand, Cisco Talos, the current owner of ClamAV are into big server business (e.g.: milters). Most of their targeted use case are much beefier server machines that probably handle loading the database in a blink. Adding sd_notify might not be on the top of their priority list. :-/ ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-10-25 17:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1151839) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/742982> Factory / clamav ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c8)  Reinhard Max   2019-11-18 15:00:47 UTC  ``` I am closing this for now as we have workarounds in all relevant code streams. I won't get to implement the systemd improvements myself in the forseeable future, but if upstream does so, we will of course adopt it. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1151839#c10)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-25 20:15:53 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:3053-1: An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has one errata is now available.

With the trade-off of maximum double the amount memory in use, it allows to keep scanning with the previous set of signatures while loading of a new set is in progress (the existing scanner will block scanning while reloading is in progress). When the new signatures are loaded, new processes of the scanner will start using the new set. As soon as all processes using the old set have finished, the old set will be free'd and memory usage is back to normal.  It does mean however that you need to allow for a peak memory usage of around 2 GB.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2019:2595-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1144504 #1149458 #1151839
Cross-References: CVE-2019-12625 CVE-2019-12900

openSUSE Leap 15.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
This update for clamav fixes the following issues:
Security issue fixed:
- CVE-2019-12625: Fixed a ZIP bomb issue by adding detection and
heuristics for zips with overlapping files (bsc#1144504).
- CVE-2019-12900: Fixed an out-of-bounds write in decompress.c with many
selectors (bsc#1149458).
Non-security issues fixed:
- Added the --max-scantime clamscan option and MaxScanTime clamd
configuration option (bsc#1144504).
- Increased the startup timeout of clamd to 5 minutes to cater for the
grown virus database as a workaround until clamd has learned to talk to
systemd to extend the timeout as long as needed (bsc#1151839).
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use the SUSE recommended installation methods

Version        : 0.101.4+dfsg-0+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12625 CVE-2019-12900
Debian Bug     : 34359

It was discovered that clamav, the open source antivirus engine, is affected by
the following security vulnerabilities:

CVE-2019-12625

    Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, resulting from excessively long scan
    times caused by non-recursive zip bombs. Among others, this issue was
    mitigated by introducing a scan time limit.

CVE-2019-12900

    Out-of-bounds write in ClamAV's NSIS bzip2 library when attempting
    decompression in cases where the number of selectors exceeded the max limit
    set by the library.

This update triggers a transition from libclamav7 to libclama9. As a result,
several other packages will be recompiled against the fixed package after the
release of this update: dansguardian, havp, python-pyclamav, c-icap-modules.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.101.4+dfsg-0+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

### Make sure nSelectors is not out of range

```

nSelectors is used in a loop from 0 to nSelectors to access selectorMtf
which is
	UChar    selectorMtf[BZ_MAX_SELECTORS];
so if nSelectors is bigger than BZ_MAX_SELECTORS it'll do an invalid memory
access

Fixes out of bounds access discovered while fuzzying karchive

CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12625 CVE-2019-12900
Debian Bug     : 942172

The update of clamav released as DLA 1953-1 led to permission issues on
/var/run/clamav. This caused several users to experience issues restarting the
clamav daemon. This regression is caused by a mistakenly backported patch from
the stretch package, upon which this update was based.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.101.4+dfsg-0+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144504#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-08-06 12:46:40 UTC  ``` Received via oss  Hi,  Recently David Fifield presented a new variant of a ZIP bomb where by using overlapping segments he was able to achieve very high compression ratios (42kb->5GB, 10MB->281TB).  Passing the example files to clamav causes extreme CPU spikes and extremely long scanning times. In a setup with clamd (a daemon-ized version of clamav) this is particularly nasty, as even interrupting the scanning process doesn't stop the CPU spikes in the daemon and the daemon cannot be killed gracefully.  clamav is often used to automatically scan incoming mails on mailservers, in this case this is can be effective way to make a server unusable.  The upstream bug report is here [2]. Clamav made a new release 0.101.3 [3] with a mitigation.  However David Fifield commented in the bug report [4] that the fix is incomplete, by using some slight variations of his methods he could bypass the fix.  Mitigation ==========  This can be mitigated by disabling scanning of compressed archives. In the case of clamd there's a setting "ScanArchive" in clamd.conf [5].  Downside: Obviously that means compressed files won't be scanned.  misc ====  Firefox sometimes showed Safebrowsing warnings for the "better zip bomb" web page by David Fifield. Not sure how it ended up in the safe browsing list, though I believe it's bad practice to mark legit security research as "malicious" by blacklists.  A similar DoS is happening in Chrome when downloading the sample ZIP bombs. This has already been mentioned in public comments, e.g. here [6]. I had reported this to Chrome, it was marked as a duplicate of a non-public bug.  It's likely that there are more applications affected. I recommend that people try to test other applications that might unpack ZIP files in an automated setting with these sample files.

However, it seems that this issue is still under discussion since the patch seems incomplete (= there are ways to bypass it). See [2] for more information.

[...]      The zip bomb vulnerability mitigated in 0.101.3 has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2019-12625. Unfortunately, a workaround for the zip-bomb mitigation was immediately identified. To remediate the zip-bomb scan time issue, a scan time limit has been introduced in 0.101.4. This limit now resolves ClamAV's vulnerability to CVE-2019-12625.  The default scan time limit is 2 minutes (120000 milliseconds).  To customize the time limit: - use the clamscan  --max-scantime option - use the clamd  MaxScanTime config option  Libclamav users may customize the time limit using the cl_engine_set_num function. For example:  C     cl_engine_set_num(engine, CL_ENGINE_MAX_SCANTIME, time_limit_milliseconds) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1144504#c5)  Andreas Stieger   2019-09-04 20:14:17 UTC  ``` <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/728340> ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1144504#c6)  Reinhard Max   2019-10-25 16:28:42 UTC  ``` Submitted backports to SLE-10-SP3, SLE-11-SP1, SLE-12 and SLE-15. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1144504#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-25 17:50:17 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.
