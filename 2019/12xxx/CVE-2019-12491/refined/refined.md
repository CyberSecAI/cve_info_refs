Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way OnApp manages servers within its cloud environment. Specifically, the OnApp platform allows users to trigger SSH connections from the OnApp control panel to managed servers with SSH agent forwarding enabled. This, combined with the use of the same SSH key pair across multiple servers, allows for relaying authentication to other servers within the same cloud.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SSH Agent Forwarding Enabled:** The OnApp control panel initiates SSH connections to managed servers with the `-A` flag enabled, which activates SSH agent forwarding. This allows the managed server to use the forwarded authentication to connect to other servers as the user initiating the original SSH connection.
2.  **Same Key Pair Across Servers:** OnApp uses the same SSH key pair to manage all servers within a single cloud environment. This allows an attacker, once gaining access to one server, to use the forwarded authentication to gain access to other servers.
3.  **Code Execution via Binary Replacement**: The management software executes certain binaries on the managed servers (e.g. `tput`). By gaining root access on a server, an attacker can replace these binaries with malicious scripts, thus achieving code execution whenever OnApp initiates a connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the SSH agent forwarding and the shared SSH key across all servers, an attacker can achieve RCE with root privileges on any server within the OnApp cloud.
*   **Full Cloud Compromise:** An attacker could potentially compromise an entire private or public cloud managed by OnApp by starting from one server.
*   **Widespread Impact:** The vulnerability affected all OnApp Control Panels managing XEN or KVM compute resources, not only a single hosting provider, putting potentially 100,000s of servers and businesses at risk

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Initial Access:** An attacker gains access to one server within the OnApp environment. This can be done, for example, by renting a server from a cloud provider using OnApp, as it doesn't require special access to exploit.
2.  **Root Access:** The attacker obtains root access on the initial server. This is a standard part of having access to the server from the cloud provider.
3.  **Binary Replacement:** The attacker replaces a binary that is executed by the management software during the connection (e.g. `tput`).
4.  **Trigger Connection:** The attacker uses OnAppâ€™s control panel to trigger a management SSH connection to their server. This initiates code execution with the replaced binary.
5.  **Agent Forwarding Abuse:** The malicious script executes an SSH command that utilizes agent forwarding to connect to another server within the cloud, thus authenticating with root credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to rent/access one server** within a cloud environment managed by OnApp.
*   **Root privileges** on the compromised server.
*   **Basic understanding** of SSH and agent forwarding.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Skylight Cyber and reported to OnApp.
*   OnApp released patches for versions 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0 to address the issue.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2019-12491.
* The article also highlights the lack of response from the local CERT when the researchers tried to report the issue to them.
