Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-12838 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) failing to properly escape strings when importing an archive file into the `accounting_storage/mysql` backend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  The lack of string sanitization allows for SQL injection attacks. This means an attacker could inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized database access and modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the SLURM database.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Malicious SQL code could modify, delete, or corrupt data within the SLURM database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not explicitly stated, successful SQL injection can sometimes be used to gain elevated privileges within the database system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Importing Archive Files:** The primary attack vector is through the `sacctmgr archive load` functionality within SLURM, specifically when using the MySQL accounting backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to SLURM:**  An attacker needs to be able to interact with the `sacctmgr` tool and have the ability to import manipulated archive files.  This might require a compromised user account or an ability to manipulate data within the network that slurm can access.

**Additional Details and Context from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** SchedMD Slurm versions 17.11.x, 18.08.0 through 18.08.7, and 19.05.0 are identified as vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** Patches involve ensuring strings are always properly escaped before being used in SQL queries in the `slurmdbd` which manages the database interactions.
*   **Vendor Coordination:** SchedMD informed customers and provided a patch before public disclosure.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" by some vendors and as “important” by others.
*   **Affected Products:** Multiple Linux distributions (openSUSE, Debian, Fedora) and SUSE Linux Enterprise products were impacted, requiring security updates.
*   **Specifics of the Fix**: The fix is implemented in the `accounting_storage/mysql` plugin, ensuring strings are escaped before being used in SQL queries. This prevents the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Mitigation for Older Versions:** While fixes were released for supported versions (18.08 and 19.05) it was recommended that sites using older versions upgrade to a supported version of Slurm.
*   **CVSS Scores:** The vulnerability has a high base CVSS v3 score of 9.8 (from NVD) in one instance, but the SUSE score is a lower 6.3 (which notes low privilege and low impact).
