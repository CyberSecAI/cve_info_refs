- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect access control in Istio's policy enforcement mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way Istio handles authorization for TCP services when policy enforcement is enabled and a Mixer adapter (Deny Checker or List Checker) is used. Specifically, the access control logic is flawed, leading to bypass of intended policies.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful exploit could allow unauthorized access to TCP services within the Istio mesh. An attacker might be able to bypass intended access controls, leading to potential data breaches or unauthorized actions on the affected service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent network access. An attacker with access to the internal network of the Istio mesh can potentially exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access within the Istio mesh and target a TCP service that relies on Mixer adapters for authorization (specifically Deny Checker or List Checker) when policy enforcement is enabled. The attacker does not require any privileges.
