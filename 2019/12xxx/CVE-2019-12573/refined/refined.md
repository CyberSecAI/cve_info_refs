The provided content is related to CVE-2019-12573.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to the lack of sanitization of the `--log` parameter in the `openvpn_launcher` binary of the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `openvpn_launcher` binary is setuid root, meaning it runs with root privileges.
- The `--log` parameter, which accepts a file path, is not properly sanitized. This allows a local, unprivileged user to specify an arbitrary file path as the log destination.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local, unprivileged attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the system, including those owned by root.
- This can lead to a denial of service condition or data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited locally.
- An attacker can use the `openvpn_launcher` binary with the `--log` option to specify a target file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- They must be able to execute the `openvpn_launcher` binary.
- They do not need root privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
