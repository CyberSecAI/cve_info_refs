Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of the `install.php` file in the public webroot of Silverstripe 4.x installations. This file is intended for initial setup but, if not removed, can be accessed by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing warning:** Unlike older versions, Silverstripe 4.1+ doesn't display a prominent warning in the CMS if `install.php` is present in the `public/` directory, increasing the risk of oversight.
- **Unprotected installer:** The `install.php` file allows unauthenticated access to administrative functions when present in the public webroot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthenticated Admin Access:** Attackers can create new administrative users, granting them full CMS control.
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can alter database connection details, potentially disrupting the site or gaining access to sensitive data.
- **Data Exposure:**  Attackers with administrative privileges can access sensitive data within the CMS, including draft content, form submissions, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** Attackers access the `install.php` file through the web server.
- **Public Webroot:** The vulnerability is present when the installer file is present in the web accessible directory `public/`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any existing credentials.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable website.
- **Knowledge of default install path:**  The attacker must know the default location of the `install.php` file which is in `public/`

**Additional Notes:**
- Projects upgrading from versions prior to 4.1 are less likely to be affected due to the prominent CMS warning during install process.
- The vulnerability does not expose user passwords or database credentials directly, but rather enables the attacker to change these.
- The vulnerability is considered "Critical" with a CVSS score of 9.4.
- The provided content also states that the issue has been mitigated at the infrastructure level for users of Silverstripe Platform and the New Zealand Common Web Platform (CWP).
