# Anviz Pwn! How broken devices could be? (CVE-2019-12393/CVE-2019-12391/CVE-2019-12392/CVE-2019-12390/CVE-2019-12389/CVE-2019-12388/CVE-2019-12394/CVE-2019-12518,CVE-2020-19594)

# How broke is your biometrics?

## Anviz study case

Anviz is a company that provides products that help secure facilities by controlling access to them, being by scanning a keycard or by verifying some biometric patterns on the people accessing it.

This story starts like so many stories start. Anviz sellers told me and [@Luis Catarino](https://twitter.com/_lcatarino) that their system was ‘top of the line’ and that was as secure it can be. So, we decided to put it to the test.

Starting by building the infrastructure. The systems are quite simple to install. There are devices and there is a management application. Several implementations of the same application exist but we are going to only look for the official ones (CrossChex and Anviz Management System).

In a controlled IP network, we deploy three devices and set an IP address for each one. Then, on the management application we saw something weird as soon we tried to add the deployed devices. An Exception, cannot access memory. Humm looks weird but lets us proceed.

From the management console, we can add new devices by point to an IP and setting up a management password if needed. The console speaks by a proprietary protocol to the device. There are other ways of connecting to the device such as USB or [RS-232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232), but let us focus on the IP implementation since it’s the most widespread.

## Replay attack (CVE-2019-12393)

From the console we can perform several actions: open the door by software, retrieve records and users’ data, set the time and date and so on…

Ok, so we have a device that communicates using an IP network stack to a device. Let us analyse the protocol with Wireshark.

First, let us start with the basics. We wanted to know how to open the door with the smartphone (like the cool kids in [Watch Dogs](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/watch-dogs-2/), the game). For that, we send the request to open the door and see the network traffic on Wireshark.

The first thing we tested is to replay the request. If the packet is valid and we can replay it we are sure that there is no [NONCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) being employed and we can just send the packet every time we want to open the door.

Success! the devices are vulnerable to replay attacks!

## Reverse Engineering the protocol

If the device is vulnerable to replay attacks and the protocol doesn’t employ any encryption we can see how the authentication process is being made.

In Wireshark we know, by looking at the packets under a controlled environment, that the device answers on port tcp/5010. We can then apply a filter to only filter communication on that port and follow the TCP stream.

The packets are incorrectly labelled IPCTL packets but that’s not the correct protocol. We needed to interpret the data packets as a new protocol.

We then start by performing actions on the device to reverse engineer the protocol.
Every packet starts with a preamble *\xa50* and every packet has a replay attack vulnerability, meaning that for every request we made, if we replicate it, the device would answer. With that in mind, and due to the fact the packets are deterministic, we start by performing small and basic operations such as open the door by software, getting device information, get the number of records saved in the device, getting network information of the device and get the time and date of the device.

From what was able to perceive we draft the following structure:

```
| Preamble |       DATA UNKNOWN       |                  CMD                   |                              LEN                              |   DATA UNKOWN   |
| :------: | :----------------------: | :------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------: |
|   \xa5   | <4 bytes, small numbers> | <1 byte, changes with issued command > | <2 bytes changes with the amount of data, 0 to a get command> | 2 or more bytes |

```

And the answers are similar depending on the information required

```
| Preamble |       DATA UNKNOWN        |      CMD+128       |       ACK        |                              LEN                               |   DATA UNKOWN   |
| :------: | :-----------------------: | :----------------: | :--------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------: |
|   \xa5   | < same as in the request> | <1 byte, CMD+128 > | 1byte(exit code) | <2 bytes changes with the ammount of data, 0 to a get command> | 2 or more bytes |

```

However, we weren’t able to determine where the password was being sent. We were able to look for the password in the GET\_DEVICE\_INFO command. This is interesting since we now know how the data is arranged (little-endian vs. big-endian). But, the password is not transmitted in any of the packets… does that mean?… Well yes, the password doesn’t do shit.

So, we have a protocol, vulnerable to replay attacks and that requires no password to respond. Now the stakes are high. If by reverse engineering the protocol we can emulate a device and retrieve information about the records stored, the fingerprint, passwords, names and PINs of every user enrolled in the device that will demonstrate that the device is prone to attacks that disclose sensitive information.
Furthermore, Anviz itself propose an architecture implementation where they recommend to expose the device itself, to interconnect different [sites](https://www.anviz.com/faq/19.html) this means that there are some people, port forwarding these connections to the world, exposing all the biometric data (small vector table) and some personally identifiable information about the users!

Thus it’s paramount to understand the protocol to be able to exploit the device.
Lets head back to the CMD\_OPEN\_DOOR and the other requests captured:

```
| Preamble |   DATA UNKNOWN   | CMD  |   LEN    |       DATA UNKOWN        |
| :------: | :--------------: | :--: | :------: | :----------------------: |
|   \xa5   | \x00\x00\x00\x00 | \x5e | \x00\x00 | \x07\x05                 |

```

The packet data starts always with a *\xa5* byte. Depending on the device we tested the following four bytes differ. Maybe something related with the device identification? Weird enough with NULL bytes the request is accepted by every device.
This packet also doesn’t produce logs in the management service, meaning that no record of the operation was created (CVE-2019-12391).

Next, we saw the same two bytes for each operation we were performing, as already stated above. This suggests that it is the command code, for instance, the command to open the door, the command to get information, and so on.

Next, we saw different kinds of data, depending on if we were just requesting information or setting information. This may suggest additional parameters on the payload.

Then we got stuck. The last bytes we suspect being some kind of control but couldn’t figure it out what it was. We even tried to send NULL bytes but it wasn’t being accepted by the device. This may suggest that is some kind of checksum. From the size (2-bytes) it could be a CRC16. However, the simple CRC16 was not working out.

Then we start looking at the vendors’ Website for clues and we found them! There is an available SDK to build your own management software. This is the example of [AEON](https://www.telemax.pt/pt-PT/produto/31706/AEON-GOLD.html) a software that allows managing Anviz devices. Since that software is not free, we won’t be looking for vulnerabilities on it since we don’t have it.

![SDK Download](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/anvizsdkdownload1.png)

By looking in the SDK we discovered all the structures needed to communicate to the device and yes, we should look it up sooner… But it was fun to know that some assumptions were actually true.

The SDK comes with a word document, with all the exported functions of the DLL SDK. It also comes with a test program that we can use to send requests.

![SDK Documentation](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/SDKword.png)

By reviewing this document we can understand what really is sent and retrieve on the wire. It is also possible to understand the responses now. As you can see in the

As you can see in the screenshot above. No password is given (CVE-2019-12392). If you think the CchexHandle contains a connection with the password, you are wrong. the handle is just created with the connection and can be bypassed without issue since we are introducing our code that will query the device immediately. There is no prior handshake required. These behaviour is also present when you try to change settings on the device, such as changing the administrator password. No previous password is required (CVE-2019-12394). For example, you can query all the information that is stored in the device, such as cleartext passwords/pins, RFID tag, name, and several other personal parameters that the device allows you to storage to identify a user (CVE-2019-12390/CVE-2019-12389/CVE-2019-12388).

![Pointing to CRC Function](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/pii.png)

The sad part is that some assumptions are true, meaning that the password isn’t required for anything and anything that is able to speak with port tcp/5010 on the device can access ALL the information that the device stores.

Regarding the checksum. We fired up IDA to check if we could find the checksum function. This was arduous work since some symbols were available but no one has the “checksum” or “CRC” on it. To be honest I think it’s redundant that there is a checksum in a TCP connection. Additionally, someone might think: hey, why didn’t you just use the SDK to interact with the devices, you moron?”. Well albeit that being true, where is the fun in that? Furthermore, we were bound to the implementation of the API provided. That includes all “security” measures applied to it. By writing your own implementation we can fuzz the protocol if we intended to do that so.

There are several techniques to discover this function. Search for the CRC16 code (you need to know how a CRC is done at the assembly level), to go throw the flow of each function to send the payload, or since this is a function that, for every request, is called it may have a lot of references to it. This is easy to find in IDA.

![Pointing to CRC Function](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/IDA-EVERYTHINGSPOINTTOCRC16.png)

This may indicate a strong candidate for the flow that we are looking for. Following the flow of a request and right before sending we came across this:

![CRC Function](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/IDA-CRC.png)

In the block named “JACKPOT”, we can see a mock function for a CRC function. So, why didn’t it worked? because of the reference in *.text:100453AF*. It references an array such as described in the “standard” implementation [CRC32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm) (but remember that we are looking for CRC16).

In the implementation, there is an array with specific numbers that will be XORed with the payload so it can produce the checksum. The array has specific values for this implementation. Following the reference we get the actual array:

![CRC Function Table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/IDA-CRCtable.png)

The other bytes are indeed variable and are related to each command, for example, if it is to set data or just retrieve it.

In the specification, there is a lot of information available, such as the methods available. some interesting methods reveal some curious functions such as retrieving GSM data (for mobile integrations) or even upload a new firmware. Just imagine uploading a backdoored firmware that allows us to pivot into the network =D.

![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/ExportTable.png)

After a while from when we discovered a document with the developed specification was “[leaked](https://github.com/benperiton/anviz-protocol/blob/master/Docs/CommsProtocol.pdf)” that details everything on the SDK. This helped us validating all the implementations made. Turns out, asking Anviz support is a great [help](http://qaru.site/questions/4210248/whats-the-checksum-algorithm-for-anviz-devices).

Comparing what we suspected from what it really was we can see that it was very

```
| Preamble |  CHANNEL  |   CMD    |    LEN    |       DATA       |   CRC16   |
| :------: | :-------: | :------: | :-------: | :--------------: | :-------: |
|   \xa5   | <4 bytes> | <1 byte> | <2 bytes> | <0 to 400 bytes> | <2 bytes> |

```

An with these we test the last 2 bytes and it corresponds to the CRC16 of the first packet. This leads us to the conclusion that they are in fact checksum bytes. CRC16 bytes.

```
| Preamble |          CHANNEL          |      CMD+128       |       ACK        |                              LEN                               |                 DATA                  | CRC16           |
| :------: | :-----------------------: | :----------------: | :--------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | :-------------- |
|   \xa5   | < same as in the request> | <1 byte, CMD+128 > | 1byte(exit code) | <2 bytes changes with the ammount of data, 0 to a get command> | < variable number of bytes up to 400> | 2 or more bytes |

```

We started creating a small python program to interact with the device, to retrieve data and to add data (a user for example). This script is helpful to scrape the internet for exposed devices. We conduct a small survey using public available information to understand what companies were exposed on the internet.

We also contacted shodan to help us map all the exposed devices on the Internet. From now on, we can search shodan for these devices!

A footnote on this CRC16 quest. We thought that the CRC16 was not standard since we used a python library and it didn’t work. Turns out that it is indeed standard and there are a lot of implementations available with different polynomials. We were only stuck with one and didn’t know. Thank you [@\_nunohumberto](https://twitter.com/_nunohumberto) for the heads up!

## We need to go deeper! Exploiting the manager (CVE-2020-19594)

After these results, we contacted our national CSIRT authority to help us contacting those companies and coordinate a responsible disclosure, more on that below.

After requesting the help we kept on digging. So far we have full control of the device. We can even understand the protocol. Won’t it be cool if we pwn the management software? The software CrossChex requires Administrative credentials to run and create the necessary sockets and packets to send to the devices. If we can pwn the software we are an elevated user in a machine. Remember the first error that appears? It was trying to access an Operating System address range. That was weird. At the time we solve it by hard resetting all the devices in the network. If a device is misbehaving and caused that error, perhaps there is a chance of buffer overflow and remote compromise.

With that permissive, we look at what service were provided by the application using standard Sysinternals tools. We can see two services. One provided in TCP/33302 and other in UDP/5060. The last one is relatable to the network scan that the application allows us to do to discover new devices on the network. Again, by running Wireshark we should be able to see how a device responds. It was quick to understand that the protocol is still being used and it remains the same and since we understand it we can emulate a device and feed erroneous data to the application. For that, we create a script that fuzzed the protocol as soon as a CMD\_DISCOVERY message was received. It took no time to rewrite the EIP value. But of course, an application of this calibre should have ASLR and DEP enable right? Well yes, but dudilengesactually no… It is disabled as seen in this Sysinternals Process Explorer screenshot.

By waiting for the CrosscChex broadcast looking for new devices, a custom broadcast packet was crafted and sent to the network, triggering the buffer overflow. At this point, due to the lack of memory protection, it was possible to search for a JMP ESP instruction to point the EIP register to, and a malicious payload was placed on top of the stack. Due to limitations on the UDP packets size, not all payloads were possible, but between the ones that were, popping a calculator and a reverse shell were the Proof-of-Concepts we decided to share. If you want the code for the exploit please refer it to [CVE-2019-12518](https://github.com/psrodrigues/anvizpwn).

A quick exploit was build to trigger the vulnerability and has we can see, we are running as the user that started the application. However, this user needs to have elevated privileges to run the application so it is easy to escalate from here.

While looking at the network traffic we noticed a small connection to an “UPDATE” service in plain HTTP. Could it be? Does it have space for an evilgrade attack in 2019? Well, yes it does =). Edit (4/04/2021): this was later given the CVE-2020-19594.

The upgrade requests a manifest file, passing as an argument the revision name, where it states the latest version and all the files that needs to download from the server to upgrade.

![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/cxupdate1.png)

Luckily this version number is stored on a file inside the installation directory. We started by going back 1 version and inspect how the installation is done, to rule out a PGP verification afterwards (like some package managers do to verify that only the vendor issued the package).

![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/cxupdate2.png)

Weird enough the version number is just something to print out on the interface. To trigger the rest of the interactions you need to change the *“VerNumber”*. Changing to a lower number will trigger the rest of the process and we can now see what is an expected response:

![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/cxupdate3.png)

As we can see in the picture, requesting a lower version number will print out a manifest with the *“NewVersion”* and *“FileList”* sections. The first, *“NewVersion”* is just like that, the new version. The other section, *“FileList”* is what indicates what files should be downloaded and replaced in the installation folder.

You can also see a new request using the same connection to GET a readme file. This text will output in the update Dialog interface.

By clicking *“Upgrade*” we can see in Wireshark the files being download just as we suspected!

![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/cxupdate4.png)

So, what if we redirect the traffic to an attackers machine and deliver our own manifest with an infected file? In theory and since we need to run this as an administrator, we can get an administrative shell. To do that we simulate the redirect by changing the host entry in the hosts file and point to our Kali machine. Then we serve a higher version number and just a new file to be downloaded, the CrossChex.exe, which is a meterpreter reverse shell.

By creating our own server we can increment by 1 the revision number and point to an infected crosschex.exe file. The installation is done using elevated privileges and on the end, our payload is triggered and we have our reverse shell =). This means anyone that is able to intercept traffic or perform a DNS poisoning attack can compromise the service and gain elevated privileges on the software.

![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/cxupdate5.png)

Pay attention to the file structure. It’s paramount that the “Upgrade.html” version number is coherent with the folder inside the *”./Upgrade/download”* location.

![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/cxupdate6.png)
![Anviz Export table](https://www.0x90.zone/images/anviz/cxupdate7.png)

Right after the “Upgrade” is done, the shell is popped and the victim compromised. No need for further interaction.

## Disclosure

With every research, there is a time where we need to finish all up and do all the due diligence, for instance, pack everything up and disclose and alert every vulnerable entity of the problem. The main goal here is not to hurt the company that made the product, it is to raise awareness about the issue and to better secure all networks.

Yes, we can avoid so much pain and stress by not divulging our findings, but that will only create havoc when people would try to exploit this in the wild.

Ok, the first time we try to contact the vendor it did not end up well. We were ignored and we got stuck immediately. We didn’t want to release an 0-day and have stores broken into or hospitals, companies and airports that use this technology. So we contacted CNCS (Centro Nacional de Ciber Seguranca). It is a governmental entity from Portugal similar to a CSIRT that offer to aid us. With a great effort from them, we built an “attack map” this was gathered with the help of online scanners such as Shodan. With this information, we passed it to CNCS so they could contact the corresponding ISPs to gather information about the companies exposed. Due to local regulations, we couldn’t contact home registered IPs. This means that a company that didn’t declare itself as a company (companies cost for ISPs are often grater than home users) could not be reached. The others were contacted to remove the exposure from the internet before we release the tools and research.

During this information gathering, we discovered a great number of exposed devices. We started questioned why is that? Why so many BIG companies exposed such devices. The answer lies in the documentation itself. As we should notice by now, RTFM comes in great help here. It turns out that the company recommends that the device should be exposed for intersite connectivity! Just do a port forwarding and you are done! No site2site tunnel, no firewall rules, just expose it since it’s all secure, right? At this point, a researcher disclosed some similar vulnerabilities as us. This is great for us since it proves that our results can be [replicated](https://github.com/wizlab-it/anviz-m3-rfid-cve-2019-11523-poc)!

Since there was no response to almost four tries, and since we got the all-clear from CNCS, we decided to publish the results. Meanwhile, the vendor decided to publish an article stating that their new version is GDPR compliant and such, but ignored us anyway. Since we did not send technical details about the vulnerabilities we don’t know what fixes were made.

Again, this research is released to the public but use it wisely, don’t do warm to other people and be conscious about every command you type!

Edit (04/04/2021 Added CVE entry for evilgrade CVE-2020-19594)

## Conclusion

This product is essentially flawed. In addition to the bad architecture and design of the product is the company posture regarding security. They did not contact us back during all the time we presented the issue. Even ignored the CSIRT contacts. There are mitigations to this issue. The first is to set all these devices on a segmented network without Internet access. Off course we are going to lose some functionality but that is the cost of having a “defective” device in the network.

Regarding our own experience, it was awesome combining so many techniques to defeat the system! Since reverse engineering network protocols to exploiting buffer overflow and DNS poisoning. And obviously, the great contribution is to alert the community that even though a product is sold as a security product, it should have a security revision to ensure that it cannot jeopardize the security of the enterprise. One of the greatest interactions was the study that we made to understand how many people were vulnerable and warn them to protect them before releasing this vulnerability since the vendor refuses to answer our emails and warn their customers.

From this disclosure we are making a tool to help other people research these issues in the future and to exploit it even further (in case someone is interested ;) ) [here](https://github.com/psrodrigues/anvizpwn).

Standard for serial communication
This article is about the RS-232, standard. For RS-232 variants, including the common 9-pin connector, see [serial port](/wiki/Serial_port "Serial port").

[Data circuit-terminating equipment](/wiki/Data_circuit-terminating_equipment "Data circuit-terminating equipment") (DCE) and [data terminal equipment](/wiki/Data_terminal_equipment "Data terminal equipment") (DTE) network

In [telecommunications](/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications"), **RS-232** or [Recommended Standard](/wiki/Recommended_Standard "Recommended Standard") 232[[1]](#cite_note-Metering_Glossary-1) is a [standard](/wiki/Technical_standard "Technical standard") originally introduced in 1960[[2]](#cite_note-CAM_1974-2) for [serial communication](/wiki/Serial_communication "Serial communication") transmission of data. It formally defines signals connecting between a *DTE* (*[data terminal equipment](/wiki/Data_terminal_equipment "Data terminal equipment")*) such as a [computer terminal](/wiki/Computer_terminal "Computer terminal") or [PC](/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), and a *DCE* (*[data circuit-terminating equipment](/wiki/Data_circuit-terminating_equipment "Data circuit-terminating equipment")* or *[data communication equipment](/wiki/Data_communication_equipment "Data communication equipment")*), such as a [modem](/wiki/Modem "Modem"). The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of signals, and the physical size and [pinout](/wiki/Pinout "Pinout") of connectors. The current version of the standard is *TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange*, issued in 1997.

The RS-232 standard had been commonly used with [serial ports](/wiki/Serial_port "Serial port") and [serial cables](/wiki/Serial_cable "Serial cable"). It is still widely used in industrial communication devices.

A serial port complying with the RS-232 standard was once a standard feature of many types of computers. [Personal computers](/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer") used them for connections not only to modems, but also to [printers](/wiki/Printer_%28computing%29 "Printer (computing)"), [computer mice](/wiki/Computer_mice "Computer mice"), data storage, [uninterruptible power supplies](/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supplies "Uninterruptible power supplies"), and other peripheral devices.

Compared with later interfaces such as [RS-422](/wiki/RS-422 "RS-422"), [RS-485](/wiki/RS-485 "RS-485") and [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), RS-232 has lower transmission speed, shorter maximum cable length, larger voltage swing, larger standard connectors, no multipoint capability and limited multidrop capability. In modern personal computers, [USB](/wiki/USB "USB") has displaced RS-232 from most of its peripheral interface roles. Thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity, however, RS-232 interfaces are still used—particularly in industrial CNC machines, networking equipment and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is fully adequate.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

## Scope of the standard

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Scope of the standard")]

The [Electronic Industries Association](/wiki/Electronic_Industries_Association "Electronic Industries Association") (EIA) standard RS-232-C[[4]](#cite_note-eia-4) as of 1969 defines:

* Electrical signal characteristics such as [logic levels](/wiki/Logic_level "Logic level"), [baud rate](/wiki/Baud_rate "Baud rate"), timing, and [slew rate](/wiki/Slew_rate "Slew rate") of signals, voltage withstand level, [short-circuit](/wiki/Short-circuit "Short-circuit") behavior, and maximum load [capacitance](/wiki/Capacitance "Capacitance").
* Interface mechanical characteristics, pluggable connectors and pin identification.
* Functions of each circuit in the interface connector.
* Standard subsets of interface circuits for selected telecom applications.

The standard does not define such elements as the [character encoding](/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding") (i.e. [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII "ASCII"), [EBCDIC](/wiki/EBCDIC "EBCDIC"), or others), the framing of characters (start or stop bits, etc.), transmission order of bits, or error detection protocols. The character format and transmission bit rate are set by the serial port hardware, typically a [UART](/wiki/UART "UART"), which may also contain circuits to convert the internal [logic levels](/wiki/Logic_level "Logic level") to RS-232 compatible signal levels. The standard does not define bit rates for transmission, except that it says it is intended for [bit rates](/wiki/Bit_rate "Bit rate") lower than 20,000 bits per second.

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History")]

RS-232 was first introduced in 1960[[2]](#cite_note-CAM_1974-2) by the [Electronic Industries Association](/wiki/Electronic_Industries_Association "Electronic Industries Association") (EIA) as a *Recommended Standard*.[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[1]](#cite_note-Metering_Glossary-1) The original DTEs were electromechanical [teletypewriters](/wiki/Teletypewriter "Teletypewriter"), and the original DCEs were (usually) modems. When [electronic terminals](/wiki/Electronic_terminal "Electronic terminal") (smart and dumb) began to be used, they were often designed to be interchangeable with teletypewriters, and so supported RS-232.

Because the standard did not foresee the requirements of devices such as computers, printers, test instruments, [POS terminals](/wiki/POS_terminal "POS terminal"), and so on, designers implementing an RS-232 compatible interface on their equipment often interpreted the standard idiosyncratically. The resulting common problems were non-standard pin assignment of circuits on connectors, and incorrect or missing control signals. The lack of adherence to the standards produced a thriving industry of [breakout boxes](/wiki/Breakout_box "Breakout box"), patch boxes, test equipment, books, and other aids for the connection of disparate equipment. A common deviation from the standard was to drive the signals at a reduced voltage. Some manufacturers therefore built transmitters that supplied +5 V and −5 V and labeled them as "RS-232 compatible".[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Later personal computers (and other devices) started to make use of the standard so that they could connect to existing equipment. For many years, an RS-232-compatible port was a standard feature for [serial communications](/wiki/Serial_communication "Serial communication"), such as modem connections, on many computers (with the computer acting as the DTE). It remained in widespread use into the late 1990s. In personal computer peripherals, it has largely been supplanted by other interface standards, such as USB. RS-232 is still used to connect older designs of peripherals, industrial equipment (such as [PLCs](/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller "Programmable logic controller")), [console](/wiki/System_console "System console") ports, and special purpose equipment.

The standard has been renamed several times during its history as the sponsoring organization changed its name, and has been variously known as EIA RS-232, EIA 232, and, most recently as TIA 232. The standard continued to be revised and updated by the [Electronic Industries Association](/wiki/Electronic_Industries_Association "Electronic Industries Association") and since 1988 by the [Telecommunications Industry Association](/wiki/Telecommunications_Industry_Association "Telecommunications Industry Association") (TIA).[[6]](#cite_note-6) Revision C was issued in a document dated August 1969. Revision D was issued in 1986. The current revision is *TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange*, issued in 1997. Changes since Revision C have been in timing and details intended to improve harmonization with the [CCITT](/wiki/CCITT "CCITT") standard [ITU-T/CCITT V.24](/wiki/ITU-T_V.24 "ITU-T V.24") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.24 "de:V.24")], but equipment built to the current standard will interoperate with older versions.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Related [ITU-T](/wiki/ITU-T "ITU-T") standards include V.24 (circuit identification) and [ITU-T/CCITT V.28](/wiki/ITU-T_V.28 "ITU-T V.28") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.28 "de:V.28")] (signal voltage and timing characteristics).[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

In revision D of EIA-232, the D-subminiature connector was formally included as part of the standard (it was only referenced in the appendix of RS-232-C). The voltage range was extended to ±25 volts, and the circuit capacitance limit was expressly stated as 2500 pF. Revision E of EIA-232 introduced a new, smaller, standard D-shell 26-pin "Alt A" connector, and made other changes to improve compatibility with CCITT standards V.24, V.28 and ISO 2110.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

## Limitations of the standard

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Limitations of the standard")]

Because RS-232 is used beyond the original purpose of interconnecting a terminal with a modem, successor standards have been developed to address the limitations. Issues with the RS-232 standard include:[[8]](#cite_note-8)

* The large voltage swings and requirement for positive and negative supplies increases power consumption of the interface and complicates power supply design. The voltage swing requirement also limits the upper speed of a compatible interface.
* Single-ended signaling referred to a common signal ground limits the noise immunity and transmission distance.
* Multi-drop connection among more than two devices is not defined. While multi-drop "work-arounds" have been devised, they have limitations in speed and compatibility.
* The standard does not address the possibility of connecting a DTE directly to a DTE, or a DCE to a DCE. [Null modem](/wiki/Null_modem "Null modem") cables can be used to achieve these connections, but these are not defined by the standard, and some such cables use different connections than others.
* The definitions of the two ends of the link are asymmetric. This makes the assignment of the role of a newly developed device problematic; the designer must decide on either a DTE-like or DCE-like interface and which connector pin assignments to use.
* The [Handshaking](/wiki/Handshake_%28computing%29 "Handshake (computing)") and control lines of the interface are intended for the setup and takedown of a [dial-up](/wiki/Dial-up "Dial-up") communication circuit; in particular, the use of handshake lines for [flow control](/wiki/Flow_control_%28data%29 "Flow control (data)") is not reliably implemented in many devices.
* No method is specified for sending power to a device. While a small amount of current can be extracted from the DTR and RTS lines, this is only suitable for low-power devices such as [mice](/wiki/Mouse_%28computing%29 "Mouse (computing)").
* The 25-pin D-sub connector recommended in the standard is large compared to current practice.

## Role in modern personal computers

[PCI Express](/wiki/PCI_Express "PCI Express") x1 card with one RS-232 port on a nine-pin connector

In the book *[PC 97](/wiki/PC_97 "PC 97") Hardware Design Guide*,[[9]](#cite_note-pc_97-9) [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") deprecated support for the RS-232 compatible serial port of the original IBM PC design. Today, RS-232 has mostly been replaced in personal computers by [USB](/wiki/USB "USB") for local communications. Advantages compared to RS-232 are that USB is faster, uses lower voltages, and has connectors that are simpler to connect and use. Disadvantages of USB compared to RS-232 are that USB is far less immune to [electromagnetic interference](/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference "Electromagnetic interference") (EMI) and that maximum cable length defined by standards is much shorter (15 meters for RS-232 versus 3–5 meters for USB, depending on the USB version and use of active cables). RS-232 cable lengths of 2000 meters are possible with appropriate line drivers.[[10]](#cite_note-10)[[11]](#cite_note-11)

In fields such as laboratory automation or surveying, RS-232 devices continue to be used. Some types of [programmable logic controllers](/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller "Programmable logic controller"), [variable-frequency drives](/wiki/Variable-frequency_drive "Variable-frequency drive"), [servo drives](/wiki/Servo_drive "Servo drive"), and [computerized numerical control](/wiki/Computerized_numerical_control "Computerized numerical control") equipment are programmable via RS-232. Computer manufacturers have responded to this demand by re-introducing the [DE-9M](/wiki/DE-9M "DE-9M") connector on their computers or by making adapters available.

RS-232 ports are also commonly used to communicate to [headless systems](/wiki/Headless_system "Headless system") such as [servers](/wiki/Server_%28computing%29 "Server (computing)"), where no monitor or keyboard is installed, during boot when an [operating system](/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") is not yet running and therefore no network connection is possible. A computer with an RS-232 serial port can communicate with the serial port of an [embedded system](/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system") (such as a [router](/wiki/Router_%28computing%29 "Router (computing)")) as an alternative to monitoring over Ethernet.

## Physical interface

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Physical interface")]

In RS-232, user data is sent as a [time-series](/wiki/Time-series "Time-series") of [bits](/wiki/Bit "Bit"). Both [synchronous](/wiki/Synchronous_serial_communication "Synchronous serial communication") and [asynchronous](/wiki/Asynchronous_serial_communication "Asynchronous serial communication") transmissions are supported by the standard. In addition to the data circuits, the standard defines a number of control circuits used to manage the connection between the DTE and DCE. Each data or control circuit only operates in one direction, that is, signaling from a DTE to the attached DCE or the reverse. Because transmit data and receive data are separate circuits, the interface can operate in a [full duplex](/wiki/Full_duplex "Full duplex") manner, supporting concurrent data flow in both directions. The standard does not define character framing within the data stream or character encoding.

### Voltage levels

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Voltage levels")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Rs232_oscilloscope_trace.svg/220px-Rs232_oscilloscope_trace.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ARs232_oscilloscope_trace.svg)

Diagrammatic oscilloscope trace of voltage levels for an [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") "K" character (4Bh = 01001011b) with 1 start bit, 8 data bits (least significant bit first), 1 stop bit. This is typical for start-stop communications, but the standard does not dictate a character format or bit order.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/RS232-UART_Oscilloscope_Screenshot.png/220px-RS232-UART_Oscilloscope_Screenshot.png)](/wiki/File%3ARS232-UART_Oscilloscope_Screenshot.png)

RS-232 data line on the terminals of the receiver side (RxD) probed by an oscilloscope (for an [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") "K" character (4Bh = 01001011b) with 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no parity bits)

The RS-232 standard defines the voltage levels that correspond to logical one and logical zero levels for the data transmission and the control signal lines. Valid signals are either in the range of +3 to +15 volts or the range −3 to −15 volts with respect to the "Common Ground" (GND) pin; consequently, the range between −3 and +3 volts is not a valid RS-232 level. For data transmission lines (TxD, RxD, and their secondary channel equivalents), logic one is represented as a negative voltage and the signal condition is called "mark". Logic zero is signaled with a positive voltage and the signal condition is termed "space". Control signals have the opposite polarity: the asserted or active state is positive voltage and the de-asserted or inactive state is negative voltage. Examples of control lines include request to send (RTS), clear to send (CTS), [data terminal ready](/wiki/Data_terminal_ready "Data terminal ready") (DTR), and data set ready (DSR).

RS-232 logic and voltage levels

| Data circuits | Control circuits | Voltage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 (space) | Asserted | +3 to +15 V |
| 1 (mark) | Deasserted | −15 to −3 V |

The standard specifies a maximum [open-circuit voltage](/wiki/Open-circuit_voltage "Open-circuit voltage") of 25 volts: signal levels of ±5 V, ±10 V, ±12 V, and ±15 V are all commonly seen depending on the voltages available to the [line driver](/wiki/Line_driver "Line driver") circuit. Many RS-232 driver chips have inbuilt [charge pump](/wiki/Charge_pump "Charge pump") circuitry to produce the required voltages from a 3 or 5 volt supply. RS-232 drivers and receivers must be able to withstand indefinite short circuits to the ground or to any voltage level up to ±25 volts. The [slew rate](/wiki/Slew_rate "Slew rate"), or how fast the signal changes between levels, is also controlled.

Because the voltage levels are higher than logic levels typically used by integrated circuits, special intervening driver circuits are required to translate logic levels. These also protect the device's internal circuitry from short circuits or transients that may appear on the RS-232 interface, and provide sufficient current to comply with the slew rate requirements for data transmission.

Because both ends of the RS-232 circuit depend on the ground pin being zero volts, problems will occur when connecting machinery and computers where the voltage between the ground pin on one end, and the ground pin on the other is not zero. This may also cause a hazardous [ground loop](/wiki/Ground_loop_%28electricity%29 "Ground loop (electricity)"). Use of a common ground limits RS-232 to applications with relatively short cables. If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the local ground connections at either end of the cable will have differing voltages; this difference will reduce the noise margin of the signals. Balanced, differential serial connections such as [RS-422](/wiki/RS-422 "RS-422") or [RS-485](/wiki/RS-485 "RS-485") can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling.[[12]](#cite_note-12)

Unused interface signals terminated to the ground will have an undefined logic state. Where it is necessary to permanently set a control signal to a defined state, it must be connected to a voltage source that asserts the logic 1 or logic 0 levels, for example with a [pull-up resistor](/wiki/Pull-up_resistor "Pull-up resistor"). Some devices provide test voltages on their interface connectors for this purpose.

### Connectors

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Connectors")]

RS-232 devices may be classified as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE); this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal. According to the standard, male connectors have DTE pin functions, and female connectors have DCE pin functions. Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and pin definitions. Many terminals were manufactured with female connectors but were sold with a cable with male connectors at each end; the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard.

The standard recommends the [D-subminiature](/wiki/D-subminiature "D-subminiature") 25-pin connector up to revision C, and makes it mandatory as of revision D. Most devices only implement a few of the twenty signals specified in the standard, so connectors and cables with fewer pins are sufficient for most connections, more compact, and less expensive. Personal computer manufacturers replaced the [DB-25M](/wiki/DB-25M "DB-25M") connector with the smaller [DE-9M](/wiki/DE-9M "DE-9M") connector. This connector, with a different pinout (see [Serial port pinouts](/wiki/Serial_port_pinout "Serial port pinout")), is prevalent for personal computers and associated devices.

Presence of a 25-pin D-sub connector does not necessarily indicate an RS-232-C compliant interface. For example, on the original IBM PC, a male D-sub was an RS-232-C DTE port (with a non-standard [current loop](/wiki/Current_loop "Current loop") interface on reserved pins), but the female D-sub connector on the same PC model was used for the [parallel "Centronics" printer port](/wiki/Parallel_port#Centronics "Parallel port"). Some personal computers put non-standard voltages or signals on some pins of their serial ports.

### Cables

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Cables")]
Main article: [Serial cable](/wiki/Serial_cable "Serial cable")

The standard does not define a maximum cable length, but instead defines the maximum capacitance that a compliant drive circuit must tolerate. A widely used rule of thumb indicates that cables more than 15 m (50 ft) long will have too much capacitance, unless special cables are used. By using low-capacitance cables, communication can be maintained over larger distances up to about 300 m (1,000 ft).[[13]](#cite_note-13) For longer distances, other signal standards, such as [RS-422](/wiki/RS-422 "RS-422"), are better suited for higher speeds.

Since the standard definitions are not always correctly applied, it is often necessary to consult documentation, test connections with a [breakout box](/wiki/Breakout_box "Breakout box"), or use trial and error to find a cable that works when interconnecting two devices. Connecting a fully standard-compliant DCE device and DTE device would use a cable that connects identical pin numbers in each connector (a so-called "straight cable"). "[Gender changers](/wiki/Gender_changer "Gender changer")" are available to solve gender mismatches between cables and connectors. Connecting devices with different types of connectors requires a cable that connects the corresponding pins according to the table below. Cables with 9 pins on one end and 25 on the other are common. Manufacturers of equipment with [8P8C](/wiki/8P8C "8P8C") connectors usually provide a cable with either a DB-25 or DE-9 connector (or sometimes interchangeable connectors so they can work with multiple devices). Poor-quality cables can cause false signals by [crosstalk](/wiki/Crosstalk "Crosstalk") between data and control lines (such as [Ring Indicator](#RI)).

If a given cable will not allow a data connection, especially if a [gender changer](/wiki/Gender_changer "Gender changer") is in use, a [null modem](/wiki/Null_modem "Null modem") cable may be necessary. Gender changers and null modem cables are not mentioned in the standard, so there is no officially sanctioned design for them.

## Data and control signals

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Data and control signals")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/DB-25_male.svg/220px-DB-25_male.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3ADB-25_male.svg)

Male pinout of a 25-pin serial port (D-subminiature, DB-25) commonly found on 1980s computers

The following table lists commonly used RS-232 signals (called "circuits" in the specifications) and their pin assignments on the recommended DB-25 connectors[[14]](#cite_note-14) (see [Serial port pinouts](/wiki/Serial_port_pinout "Serial port pinout") for other commonly used connectors not defined by the standard).

| Circuit | | | Direction | | [DB-25](/wiki/DB-25 "DB-25") pin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Typical purpose | Abbreviation | DTE | DCE |
| [Data Terminal Ready](/wiki/Data_Terminal_Ready "Data Terminal Ready") | DTE is ready to receive, initiate, or continue a call. | DTR | Out | In | 20 |
| [Data Carrier Detect](/wiki/Data_Carrier_Detect "Data Carrier Detect") | DCE is receiving a carrier from a remote DCE. | DCD | In | Out | 8 |
| Data Set Ready | DCE is ready to receive and send data. | DSR | In | Out | 6 |
| Ring Indicator | DCE has detected an incoming ring signal on the telephone line. | RI | In | Out | 22 |
| Request To Send | DTE requests the DCE prepare to transmit data. | RTS | Out | In | 4 |
| Ready To Receive | DTE is ready to receive data from DCE. If in use, RTS is assumed to be always asserted. | RTR | Out | In | 4 |
| Clear To Send | DCE is ready to accept data from the DTE. | CTS | In | Out | 5 |
| Transmitted Data | Carries data from DTE to DCE. | TxD | Out | In | 2 |
| Received Data | Carries data from DCE to DTE. | RxD | In | Out | 3 |
| Common Ground | Zero voltage reference for all of the above. | GND | Common | | 7 |
| Protective Ground | Connected to chassis ground. | PG | Common | | 1 |

The signals are named from the standpoint of the DTE. [The ground pin is a common return](/wiki/Single-ended_signaling "Single-ended signaling") for the other connections, and establishes the "zero" voltage to which voltages on the other pins are referenced. The DB-25 connector includes a second "protective ground" on pin 1; this is connected internally to equipment frame ground, and should not be connected in the cable or connector to signal ground.

### Ring Indicator

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Ring Indicator")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Modem_US_Robotics_Courier_Dual_Standard.jpg/220px-Modem_US_Robotics_Courier_Dual_Standard.jpg)](/wiki/File%3AModem_US_Robotics_Courier_Dual_Standard.jpg)

[USRobotics](/wiki/USRobotics "USRobotics") Courier external modem had a [DB-25](/wiki/DB-25 "DB-25") connector that used the Ring Indicator signal to notify the host computer when the connected [telephone line](/wiki/Telephone_line "Telephone line") was ringing

*Ring Indicator* (RI) is a signal sent from the DCE to the DTE device. It indicates to the terminal device that the phone line is ringing. In many computer serial ports, a [hardware interrupt](/wiki/Hardware_interrupt "Hardware interrupt") is generated when the RI signal changes state. Having support for this hardware interrupt means that a program or operating system can be informed of a change in state of the RI pin, without requiring the software to constantly "poll" the state of the pin. RI does not correspond to another signal that carries similar information the opposite way.

On an external modem the status of the Ring Indicator pin is often coupled to the "AA" (auto answer) light, which flashes if the RI signal has detected a ring. The asserted RI signal follows the ringing pattern closely, which can permit software to detect [distinctive ring](/wiki/Distinctive_ring "Distinctive ring") patterns.

The Ring Indicator signal is used by some older [uninterruptible power supplies](/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supplies "Uninterruptible power supplies") (UPSs) to signal a power failure state to the computer.

Certain personal computers can be configured for [wake-on-ring](/wiki/Wake-on-ring "Wake-on-ring"), allowing a computer that is suspended to answer a phone call.

### RTS, CTS, and RTR

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: RTS, CTS, and RTR")]
Further information: [Flow control (data) § Hardware flow control](/wiki/Flow_control_%28data%29#Hardware_flow_control "Flow control (data)")

The Request to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS) signals were originally defined for use with half-duplex (one direction at a time) modems such as the [Bell 202](/wiki/Bell_202 "Bell 202"). These modems disable their transmitters when not required and must transmit a synchronization preamble to the receiver when they are re-enabled. The DTE asserts RTS to indicate a desire to transmit to the DCE, and in response the DCE asserts CTS to grant permission, once synchronization with the DCE at the far end is achieved. Such modems are no longer in common use. There is no corresponding signal that the DTE could use to temporarily halt incoming data from the DCE. Thus RS-232's use of the RTS and CTS signals, per the older versions of the standard, is asymmetric.

This scheme is also employed in present-day RS-232 to [RS-485](/wiki/RS-485 "RS-485") converters. RS-485 is a multiple-access bus on which only one device can transmit at a time, a concept that is not provided for in RS-232. The RS-232 device asserts RTS to tell the converter to take control of the RS-485 bus so that the converter, and thus the RS-232 device, can send data onto the bus.

Modern communications environments use full-duplex (both directions simultaneously) modems. In that environment, DTEs have no reason to deassert RTS. However, due to the possibility of changing line quality, delays in processing of data, etc., there is a need for symmetric, bidirectional [flow control](/wiki/Flow_control_%28data%29 "Flow control (data)").

A symmetric alternative providing flow control in both directions was developed and marketed in the late 1980s by various equipment manufacturers. It redefined the RTS signal to mean that the DTE is ready to receive data from the DCE. This scheme was eventually codified in version RS-232-E (actually TIA-232-E by that time) by defining a new signal, "RTR (Ready to Receive)", which is CCITT V.24 circuit 133. TIA-232-E and the corresponding international standards were updated to show that circuit 133, when implemented, shares the same pin as RTS (Request to Send), and that when 133 is in use, RTS is assumed by the DCE to be asserted at all times.[[15]](#cite_note-15)

In this scheme, commonly called "RTS/CTS flow control" or "RTS/CTS handshaking" (though the technically correct name would be "RTR/CTS"), the DTE asserts RTS whenever it is ready to receive data from the DCE, and the DCE asserts CTS whenever it is ready to receive data from the DTE. Unlike the original use of RTS and CTS with half-duplex modems, these two signals operate independently from one another. This is an example of [hardware flow control](/wiki/Hardware_flow_control "Hardware flow control"). However, "hardware flow control" in the description of the options available on an RS-232-equipped device does not always mean RTS/CTS handshaking.

Equipment using this protocol must be prepared to buffer some extra data, since the remote system may have begun transmitting just before the local system de-asserts RTR.

### 3-wire and 5-wire RS-232

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: 3-wire and 5-wire RS-232")]

A minimal "3-wire" RS-232 connection consisting only of transmit data, receive data, and ground, is commonly used when the full facilities of RS-232 are not required. Even a two-wire connection (data and ground) can be used if the data flow is one way (for example, a digital postal scale that periodically sends a weight reading, or a GPS receiver that periodically sends position, if no configuration via RS-232 is necessary). When only hardware flow control is required in addition to two-way data, the RTS and CTS lines are added in a 5-wire version.

## Seldom-used features

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Seldom-used features")]

The EIA-232 standard specifies connections for several features that are not used in most implementations. Their use requires 25-pin connectors and cables.

### Signal rate selection

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Signal rate selection")]

The DTE or DCE can specify use of a "high" or "low" signaling rate. The rates, as well as which device will select the rate, must be configured in both the DTE and DCE. The prearranged device selects the high rate by setting the Data Signal Rate Selector (DSRS, pin 23) signal to ON. Sometimes called Data Rate Select (DRS), this signal should not be confused with the more commonly used Data Set Ready (DSR, pin 6).

### Loopback testing

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Loopback testing")]

Many DCE devices have a [loopback](/wiki/Loopback "Loopback") capability used for testing. When enabled, signals are echoed back to the sender rather than being sent on to the receiver. If supported, the DTE can signal the local DCE (the one it is connected to) to enter loopback mode by setting Local Loop (LL, pin 18) to ON, or the remote DCE (the one the local DCE is connected to) to enter loopback mode by setting Remote Loop (RL, pin 21) to ON. The latter tests the communications link, as well as both DCEs. When the DCE is in test mode, it signals the DTE by setting Test Indicator (TI, pin 25) to ON.

A commonly used version of loopback testing does not involve any special capability of either end. A hardware loopback is simply a wire connecting complementary pins together in the same connector (see *[loopback](/wiki/Loopback "Loopback")*).

Loopback testing is often performed with a specialized DTE called a [bit error rate tester](/wiki/Bit_error_rate_test "Bit error rate test") (or BERT).

### Timing signals

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Timing signals")]

Some synchronous devices provide a [clock signal](/wiki/Clock_signal "Clock signal") to synchronize data transmission, especially at higher data rates. Two timing signals are provided by the DCE. Pin 15 is the transmitter clock (TCK), or send timing (ST); the DTE puts the next bit on the transmit data line (pin 2) when this clock transitions from OFF to ON (so it is stable during the ON to OFF transition when the DCE registers the bit). Pin 17 is the receiver clock (RCK), or receive timing (RT); the DTE reads the next bit from the receive data line (pin 3) when this clock transitions from ON to OFF.

Alternatively, the DTE can provide a clock signal, called transmitter timing (TT, pin 24) for transmitted data. Data is changed when the clock transitions from OFF to ON, and read during the ON to OFF transition. TT can be used to overcome the problem of [propagation delay](/wiki/Propagation_delay "Propagation delay") in a long cable. ST must traverse a cable of unknown length and delay, clock a bit out of the DTE after another unknown delay, and return it to the DCE over the same unknown cable delay. When sending data at high speed, the data bit may not arrive in time for the ON to OFF transition of ST.

Since the relation between the transmitted bit and TT can be fixed in the DTE design, and since both signals traverse the same cable length, using TT eliminates the issue. TT may be generated by looping ST back with an appropriate phase change to align it with the transmitted data. ST loop back to TT lets the DTE use the DCE as the frequency reference, and correct the clock to data timing.

Synchronous clocking is required for such protocols as [SDLC](/wiki/Synchronous_Data_Link_Control "Synchronous Data Link Control"), [HDLC](/wiki/HDLC "HDLC"), and [X.25](/wiki/X.25 "X.25").

### Secondary channel

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Secondary channel")]

A secondary data channel, identical in capability to the primary channel, can optionally be implemented by the DTE and DCE devices. Pin assignments are as follows:

| Signal | Pin |
| --- | --- |
| Common Ground | 7 (same as primary) |
| Secondary Transmitted Data (STD or S.TxD) | 14 |
| Secondary Received Data (SRD or S.RxD) | 16 |
| Secondary Request To Send (SRTS or S.RTS) | 19 |
| Secondary Clear To Send (SCTS or S.CRS) | 13 |
| Secondary Carrier Detect (SDCD or S.DCD) | 12 |

## Related standards

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Related standards")]

Other serial signaling standards may not interoperate with standard-compliant RS-232 ports. For example, using the [TTL levels](/wiki/TTL_serial "TTL serial") of near +5 V and 0 V puts the mark level in the undefined area of the standard. Such levels are sometimes used with [NMEA 0183](/wiki/NMEA_0183 "NMEA 0183")-compliant [GPS](/wiki/GPS "GPS") receivers and [depth finders](/wiki/Fishfinder "Fishfinder"). A chip such as [MAX232](/wiki/MAX232 "MAX232") is required to convert the voltage levels.

A 20 mA [current loop](/wiki/Digital_current_loop_interface "Digital current loop interface") uses the absence of 20 mA current for high, and the presence of current in the loop for low; this signaling method is often used for long-distance and [optically isolated](/wiki/Opto-isolator "Opto-isolator") links. Connection of a current-loop device to a compliant RS-232 port requires a level translator. Current-loop devices can supply voltages in excess of the must-withstand voltage limits of a compliant device. The original IBM PC serial port card implemented a 20 mA current-loop interface, which was never emulated by other suppliers of [plug-compatible](/wiki/Plug-compatible "Plug-compatible") equipment.

Other serial interfaces similar to RS-232:

* [RS-422](/wiki/RS-422 "RS-422") – a high-speed system similar to RS-232 but with [differential signaling](/wiki/Differential_signaling "Differential signaling")
* [RS-423](/wiki/RS-423 "RS-423") – a high-speed system similar to RS-422 but with [unbalanced signaling](/wiki/Unbalanced_signaling "Unbalanced signaling")
* [RS-449](/wiki/RS-449 "RS-449") – a functional and mechanical interface that used RS-422 and RS-423 signals; never caught on like RS-232 and was withdrawn by the EIA
* [RS-485](/wiki/RS-485 "RS-485") – a descendant of RS-422 that can be used as a bus in multidrop configurations
* [MIL-STD-188](/wiki/MIL-STD-188 "MIL-STD-188") – a system like RS-232 but with better impedance and rise time control. One very significant difference: RS-232 uses a positive voltage to indicate a 0 and a negative voltage to indicate a 1. MIL-STD-188 uses a negative voltage for 0 and a positive voltage for a 1.
* [EIA-530](/wiki/EIA-530 "EIA-530") – a high-speed system using RS-422 or RS-423 electrical properties in an EIA-232 pinout configuration, thus combining the best of both; supersedes RS-449
* [EIA/TIA-561](/w/index.php?title=EIA/TIA-561&action=edit&redlink=1 "EIA/TIA-561 (page does not exist)") – defines RS-232 pinouts for [eight-position, eight-contact (8P8C) modular connectors](/wiki/Modular_connector#8P8C "Modular connector") (which may be improperly called RJ45 connectors)
* [EIA/TIA-562](/w/index.php?title=EIA/TIA-562&action=edit&redlink=1 "EIA/TIA-562 (page does not exist)") – low-voltage version of EIA/TIA-232
* TIA-574 – standardizes the 9-pin D-subminiature connector pinout for use with EIA-232 electrical signalling, as originated on the IBM PC/AT
* [EIA/TIA-694](/w/index.php?title=EIA/TIA-694&action=edit&redlink=1 "EIA/TIA-694 (page does not exist)") – similar to TIA/EIA-232-F but with support for higher data rates up to 512 kbit/s

The [International Telecommunication Union](/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union") publishes standard ITR-R V.24 (formerly CCITT standard V.24), "List of Definitions for Interchange Circuits between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment (DCE)" with circuit definitions compatible to those in EIA RS 232. V.24 does not specify signal levels or timing. Electrical parameters for signals are specified in ITU-R-V.28.

## Development tools

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=RS-232&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Development tools")]

When developing or troubleshooting systems using RS-232, close examination of hardware signals can be important to find problems. This can be done using simple devices with LEDs that indicate the logic levels of data and control signals. ["Y" cables](/wiki/Y-Cable "Y-Cable") may be used to allow using another serial port to monitor all traffic on one direction. A [serial line analyzer](/w/index.php?title=Serial_line_analyzer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Serial line analyzer (page does not exist)") is a device similar to a [logic analyzer](/wiki/Logic_analyzer "Logic analyzer") but specialized for RS-232's voltage levels, connectors, and, where used, clock signals; it collects, stores, and displays the data and control signals, allowing developers to view them in detail. Some simply display the signals as waveforms; more elaborate versions include the ability to decode characters in [ASCII](/wiki/ASCII "ASCII") or other common codes and to interpret common protocols used over RS-232 such as [SDLC](/wiki/Synchronous_Data_Link_Control "Synchronous Data Link Control"), [HDLC](/wiki/HDLC "HDLC"), [DDCMP](/wiki/DDCMP "DDCMP"), and [X.25](/wiki/X.25 "X.25"). Serial line analyzers are available as standalone units, as software and interface cables for general-purpose [logic analyzers](/wiki/Logic_analyzer "Logic analyzer") and [oscilloscopes](/wiki/Oscilloscope "Oscilloscope"), and as programs that run on common personal computers and devices.
