Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2019-12393 is the lack of a cryptographic nonce or similar mechanism in the Anviz device's communication protocol. This allows for the same network packets to be replayed to execute commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the device's susceptibility to replay attacks due to the absence of a nonce or similar mechanism to prevent the reuse of captured network packets.
*   **Unencrypted Communication:** The communication protocol is unencrypted, which allows attackers to easily capture and analyze network packets.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The device does not require a password or authentication mechanism to respond to commands, which increases the severity of replay attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Door Opening:** Attackers can replay captured packets to open doors controlled by the Anviz devices without any authentication.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** An attacker can gain access to user data, including names, PINs, RFID tags, and other personal information stored on the device, by replaying command packets.
*   **Bypassing Security Measures:** The ability to replay commands allows attackers to bypass security measures and control the device without proper authorization.
*   **Potential for Broader Compromise:** Due to the ability to control the device and access its stored data, there is a significant risk of further exploitation of systems connected to the device. The devices themselves are also often exposed to the internet, further increasing the attack surface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** The primary attack vector is through network sniffing, where an attacker intercepts network traffic between the management console and the device.
*   **Packet Replay:** Once the packets are captured, an attacker can replay them to execute commands on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the Anviz device or have the ability to intercept network traffic to/from it.
*   **Packet Capture:** The attacker must be able to capture network packets sent to the Anviz device, usually by running a network sniffer such as Wireshark.
*   **Replay Tool:** The attacker needs a tool or script to replay the captured network packets to the Anviz device.
*   **No authentication is needed**: As the device doesn't perform any authentication, the attacker doesn't need any valid credentials.

In summary, CVE-2019-12393 highlights a serious vulnerability in Anviz devices due to a lack of proper security measures in their communication protocol. This allows for easy exploitation through replay attacks, with the potential for significant compromise of access control systems.
