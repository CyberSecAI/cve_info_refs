Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-12587:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) authentication within the ESP32/ESP8266 SDKs. Specifically, the devices do not properly validate or handle a zero-valued PMK (Pairwise Master Key) during EAP authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper PMK validation. The device accepts a zero-valued PMK without proper checks during EAP authentication.
- Vulnerable SDKs include ESP-IDF v4.0-dev-459-gba1ff1692 and NONOS-SDK v3.0-103-g7a31cb7.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to hijack ESP32/ESP8266 clients that are connected to enterprise networks.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, allowing the attacker to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to set up a rogue access point that mimics a legitimate enterprise network.
- The rogue access point forces the ESP device to use a zero-valued PMK during the authentication process.
- The attack is carried out through the air, using Wi-Fi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be within Wi-Fi range of the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a rogue access point capable of performing the exploit.
- The attacker must have a modified hostapd to send a zero-valued PMK in the EAP authentication process.

**Additional Information:**

- The provided Github repository contains a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation of the vulnerability.
- The repository includes a modified version of `hostapd` (a user-space access point daemon) to demonstrate the attack.
- The PoC can be tested against ESP32/ESP8266 devices using a specifically crafted EAP authentication process.
- The `run_zero_pmk_EAP.sh` script is used to start hostapd in the vulnerable mode that sends a zero PMK.
-  The repository also provides test client codes which can be used to verify that the devices are vulnerable.
