The provided content is related to CVE-2019-12136.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input within the "mermaid" label functionality. Specifically, the application does not properly escape or neutralize HTML tags and JavaScript code included in the mermaid diagram definition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is a stored XSS. The application renders a user-supplied string as HTML without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's browser session.
- Potential for malicious activities, including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user creates or edits a note and inserts a crafted mermaid diagram definition that includes an iframe with a JavaScript payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create or edit notes with the mermaid label.
- The attacker does not need to be logged-in as an admin, or have any special permissions. Any user with write access to notes, can exploit this vulnerability.
