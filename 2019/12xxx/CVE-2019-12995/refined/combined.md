## Description

![@divya21raj](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31413064?u=30de81cd90165cc12c83bba8852fa8fb9408b67f&v=4&size=48)[divya21raj](https://github.com/divya21raj)opened [on Jun 24, 2019](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/15084#issue-459696678)

**Bug description**

I'm trying to implement service to service JWT authentication like something shown in [this](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-api-auth-samples/tree/master/machine-to-machine) repo. While it's working fine with Auth0, I'm having trouble while setting it up with my company's authentication service. I made the service architecture by following [this](https://medium.com/google-cloud/back-to-microservices-with-istio-p1-827c872daa53) article, you can see my repository [here](https://github.com/divya21raj/Istio-Powered-Sentiment-Analysis).

This is the policy I'm applying ->

```
apiVersion: authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: auth-policy
spec:
  targets:
  - name: sa-web-app
  origins:
  - jwt:
      issuer: "My-Issuer"
      jwksUri: "http://10.0.75.1:8080/pub_key.json"
  principalBinding: USE_ORIGIN

```

I'm hosting the public key locally, you can find it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divya21raj/Istio-Powered-Sentiment-Analysis/master/pub_key.json) too.

If I hit the service with an invalid access key (say it's expired), I'm getting a 401 as expected, but a valid access key gives a

`503: upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: connection failure`

Upon checking the logs for the envoy proxy of the publisher pod, I can see this ->

`Epoch 0 terminated with an error: signal: segmentation fault (core dumped)`

This log message isn't there when working successfully with Auth0, so I think this might be a hint. But looking at the lines in the source code where this log message is present, I can't figure out much....

One reason I think this might occur is the different keys in access token I'm passing. The Auth0 access token has the following keys ->

```
{
  "iss": "https://xyz-sa.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "0BH7c261T8X0nt9b9B3UE4mP0L5O057V@clients",
  "aud": "https://sentiment-analysis.io/webapp",
  "iat": 1561353753,
  "exp": 1561440153,
  "azp": "0BH7c261T8X0nt9b9B3UE4mP0L5O057V",
  "gty": "client-credentials"
}

```

And my access token looks like this ->

```
{
  "http://www.xyz.com/identity/claims/tenancy/slug": "4d8ad062-7f6d-4b4d-9a64-f1c3627a97b4",
  "subtype": "app",
  "nbf": 1561353003,
  "exp": 1561354803,
  "iss": "xyz.com"
}

```

Anybody has any ideas, I've been stuck for quite some time now, any help will be appreciated..!
