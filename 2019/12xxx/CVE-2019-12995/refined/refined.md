Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the information related to CVE-2019-12995:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content includes a GitHub issue titled "JWT authentication causing 'Epoch 0 terminated with an error' in Envoy #15084". This issue directly relates to a problem with JWT authentication in Istio's Envoy proxy, which is a known issue fixed in Istio 1.2.2. CVE-2019-12995 is associated with this JWT related issue.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a bug in Istio's JWT Envoy filter, which leads to a crash when processing malformed JWT tokens or tokens with unexpected claims. This crash manifests as a segmentation fault in the Envoy proxy, resulting in the "Epoch 0 terminated with an error: signal: segmentation fault (core dumped)" message. The issue arises when the JWT token has a different structure than what Istio expects. Specifically, when using a custom authentication service, the claims within the JWT might not match what the Istio JWT filter expects, triggering the crash.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Crash Vulnerability**: The Envoy proxy crashes when encountering a malformed JWT. This crashes the sidecar proxy.
   - **Denial of Service**: The crash can be exploited to cause a denial of service.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Service Disruption:** When a malformed JWT is processed by the Envoy proxy, it crashes, interrupting the connection between the microservices.
   - **Potential Denial of Service:** Repeatedly sending malformed JWTs to a service can lead to a denial of service, as the Envoy sidecar continuously crashes.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malformed JWTs**: Sending specially crafted JWT tokens to the service.
   - **Unexpected Claims**: If the service uses a custom authentication service, claims in the tokens could trigger the crash.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send requests with a JWT token to a service protected by Istio's JWT authentication policy.
   - No other special access or privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The provided content indicates that the issue was fixed in Istio 1.2.2, which is documented in the release notes.
   -  The GitHub issue shows that the vulnerability is related to the way Istio's JWT filter parses and handles the tokens and unexpected claims.
   - The user in the Github issue was trying to implement service-to-service JWT authentication, which highlights a common scenario in microservice architectures.

This information provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability described in the provided content, aligning with the description of CVE-2019-12995.
