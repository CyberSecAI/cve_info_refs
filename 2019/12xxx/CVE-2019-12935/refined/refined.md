Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input sanitization within the Shopware application, specifically in the handling of query string parameters in the `backend/Login` URLs. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The application reflects unsanitized user-supplied input within the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Defacement:** Malicious code could alter the appearance of the login page.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers might use this vulnerability to create fake login pages that steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is manipulating the query string parameters of the `backend/Login` URL.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user (typically an administrator in this case since it's a backend login page) visits the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with malicious payloads embedded in the query string.
*   **Social Engineering or Phishing:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to click on the crafted link.

**Technical Details (from Netsparker advisory):**

*   **Vulnerable URLs:**
    *   `http://{DOMAIN}/{PATH-OF-SHOPWARE}/backend/Login?'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(“test”)</scRipt>`
    *   `http://{DOMAIN}/{PATH-OF-SHOPWARE}/backend/Login/load/?'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(“test”)</scRipt>`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** Query String
*   **Attack Pattern:** `'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(“test”)</scRipt>`
* The provided payload injects a style tag closing, then a script tag executing an alert box, which is a common way to test for XSS.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Netsparker (now Invicti) and assigned advisory reference `NS-19-004`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by the vendor in version 5.5.8.
*   The vulnerability affects Shopware version 5.5.6.
