  "CVE-2019-12528": {
    "Root cause": "Incorrect data management in Squid's FTP gateway when translating FTP server listings into HTTP responses.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect input validation",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "Disclosure of sensitive information from heap memory, including data from other users' sessions or non-Squid processes.  If mempools is disabled the information may be anything from the heap area including information from other processes on the machine.",
    "Attack vectors": "A crafted FTP server response",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or have access to a malicious FTP server that is contacted by the vulnerable squid proxy."
  },

    "Root cause": "Incorrect input validation of HTTP requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect input validation",

    ],
    "Impact": "Access to server resources that were prohibited by earlier security filters.",

      "Buffer overflow"

        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
       "Impact": "The NTLM authentication credentials parser in ext_lm_group_acl may write to memory outside the credentials buffer, potentially causing a crash (DoS) of the helper process, leading to the termination of the Squid process and a denial of service for all clients using the proxy. There are also hints of information disclosure.",

      "Impact": "When certain web browsers are used, it is possible to inject HTML into cachemgr.cgi.",
