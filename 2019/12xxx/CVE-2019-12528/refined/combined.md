Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2020:2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2020:2
Date: February 02, 2020
Summary: Information Disclosure issue
in FTP Gateway.
Affected versions: Squid 2.x -> 2.7.STABLE9
Squid 3.x -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.x -> 4.9
Fixed in version: Squid 4.10
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2020\_2.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12528
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrect data management Squid is vulnerable to a
information disclosure when translating FTP server listings
into HTTP responses.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
Certain FTP server responses can result in Squid revealing
random amounts of memory content from heap.
When Squid mempools feature is enabled the leak is limited to
lines in FTP directory listings, possibly from other clients.
When mempools is disabled the information may be anything from
the heap area including information from other processes on the
machine.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.10.
In addition, a patch addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3:
Squid 4:
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid-2.x up to and including 2.7.STABLE9 are vulnerable.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.
All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.9 are vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
\* To disable FTP features
Remove from squid.conf:
acl Safe\_ports 21
Add to squid.conf:
acl FTP proto FTP
http\_access deny FTP
\* To reduce leakage while retaining FTP features:
Remove from squid.conf:
memory\_pools off
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-ab8e7463ab
2020-04-03 18:02:36.523912
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.10
Release : 3.fc30
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

Debian Bug     : 950802 931478 950925 912294

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by multiple security vulnerabilities.
Due to incorrect input validation and URL request handling it was
possible to bypass access restrictions for restricted HTTP servers
and to cause a denial-of-service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.23-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

For the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-790296a8f4
2020-04-03 19:15:34.237054
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 4.10
Release : 3.fc31
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12521 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12521)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it's off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can't affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.

# CVE-2020-8517

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-8516.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-8551.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-8517 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8517)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.10. Due to incorrect input validation, the NTLM authentication credentials parser in ext\_lm\_group\_acl may write to memory outside the credentials buffer. On systems with memory access protections, this can result in the helper process being terminated unexpectedly. This leads to the Squid process also terminating and a denial of service for all clients using the proxy.

## Details

Jeriko One discovered that Squid incorrectly handled memory when connected

to an FTP server. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain

sensitive information from Squid memory. ([CVE-2019-12528](/security/CVE-2019-12528))

Regis Leroy discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain HTTP

requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to access server

resources prohibited by earlier security filters. ([CVE-2020-8449](/security/CVE-2020-8449))

Guido Vranken discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain buffer

operations when acting as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use

this issue to cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-8450](/security/CVE-2020-8450))

Aaron Costello discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain NTLM

authentication credentials. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue

to cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2020-8517](/security/CVE-2020-8517))

# CVE-2019-12519

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-12497.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-12520.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12519 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12519)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Squid through 4.7. When handling the tag esi:when when ESI is enabled, Squid calls ESIExpression::Evaluate. This function uses a fixed stack buffer to hold the expression while it's being evaluated. When processing the expression, it could either evaluate the top of the stack, or add a new member to the stack. When adding a new member, there is no check to ensure that the stack won't overflow.

# CVE-2020-11945

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2020-11936.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2020-11947.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2020-11945 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11945)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Squid before 5.0.2. A remote attacker can replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. This occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter (a short integer). Remote code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of replayed as valid credentials).
