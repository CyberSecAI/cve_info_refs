  "CVE-2019-12449": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in GNOME gvfs 1.29.4 through 1.41.2. daemon/gvfsbackendadmin.c mishandles a file's user and group ownership during move (and copy with G_FILE_COPY_ALL_METADATA) operations from admin:// to file:// URIs, because root privileges are unavailable.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect handling of file ownership when moving or copying files from an 'admin://' URI to a 'file://' URI, as the process does not have root privileges to preserve ownership, resulting in the file being owned by the user instead of root.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of file's user and group ownership during move/copy operations",
        "Lack of proper privilege management when transferring files between different URI schemes"
      ],
      "impact": "Confidential information could be exposed to unauthorized users. The moved or copied files will be owned by the user instead of the root, leading to potential access of sensitive data",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is local and the vulnerability can be triggered by performing file operations with gvfs through admin:// URI.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have the ability to perform a move or copy operation from admin:// URI to a file:// URI and requires access to the copied file."
