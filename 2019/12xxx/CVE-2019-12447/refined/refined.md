{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `gvfsbackendadmin.c` in GNOME gvfs mishandles file ownership because setfsuid is not used. When using the admin:// backend to copy a file owned by root, the target file has the wrong ownership.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect file ownership handling",
      "Missing use of setfsuid"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain read/write access to a copied file because the target file has the wrong ownership.  The file is accessible to the regular user and not only by root.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Any application that makes use of gvfs and the admin:// backend. Applications utilizing the admin:// backend to copy a root-owned file to a location that the user has access to can trigger the vulnerability.",
       "Network based attacks via applications using gvfs"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate a copy/move operation of a root-owned file via the admin:// backend. The user interaction is usually needed to provide a password for privilege elevation.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs during file copy operations to a target location handled by the admin:// backend. The destination file, handled by the admin:// backend, is created with the regular user privileges instead of with root ones. The issue is that `acquire_caps()` drops root privileges to make dbus work, but does not use `setfsuid()` to still behave like root when working with files."
