Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12209:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The `pam_u2f` module in versions prior to 1.0.8 blindly follows symlinks when parsing the configured authentication file (default `$HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys`).  It also attempts to parse the file as root unless the `openasuser` option is enabled in the PAM configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Symlink Following:** The module doesn't verify that the path to the authfile lacks symlinks, allowing an attacker to redirect the module to an arbitrary file.
*   **Privileged File Access:** The module, when debug is enabled, attempts to open the authfile as root, potentially leaking file content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By creating a symlink to a sensitive file (e.g., /etc/shadow, /root/.bash_history), an attacker can have parts of the file's content logged (if the debug option is enabled), leading to information disclosure.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker might be able to use other users' `u2f_keys` files if the target user's file is a symlink pointing to another user's file.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system to create symlinks within the target user's home directory.
*   **PAM Configuration:** The attacker leverages the `pam_u2f` module and its configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   A user account on the target system.
*   Ability to create symlinks within their own home directory.
*  If the debug option is not enabled, and the attacker wants to leak file contents, they may need to have root access to configure the PAM configuration to enable the debug option and debug file, or trick an administrator to do it.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in `pam-u2f` version 1.0.8. The fix involves dropping privileges to the user before accessing the `u2f_keys` file.
*   Enabling the `openasuser` option also mitigates the symlink attack.
*   Upstream communication was responsive and constructive.
*   SUSE rated the severity of the vulnerability as moderate.
*   The fix was released by Yubico on 2019-06-04.
*   Several Linux distributions (SUSE, openSUSE, Fedora) have released patches for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Matthias Gerstner of the SUSE Security Team.
