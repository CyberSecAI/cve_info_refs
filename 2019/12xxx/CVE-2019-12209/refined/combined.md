# CVE-2019-12209

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-12207.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-12210.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12209 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12209)

#### Description

Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f\_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and does not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other files on the system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the PAM configuration, part of the file contents of a symlink target will be logged, possibly revealing sensitive information.

Subject: pam-u2f: CVE-2019-12210: debug_file file descriptor leak,
 CVE-2019-12209: symlink attack on u2f_keys leading to possible information
 leak

Hello,

pam-u2f [1] is a PAM module that allows to integrate universal 2nd
factor authenticators like YubiKey into the PAM stack. In the context of
a source code review [2] due to the inclusion of pam-u2f into SUSE Linux
two security issues in this PAM module have been uncovered as described
in the following sections.

CVE-2019-12210: debug_file file descriptor leak
-----------------------------------------------

If the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug
file will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process.
Therefore this user can write further information to it, possibly
filling up a privileged file system or manipulating the information
found in the debug file.

In some contexts the program utilizing PAM closes off leaked file
descriptors but it does work with su, for example, use the following
line in the PAM stack:

```
auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug debug_file=/tmp/u2f-debug.txt
```

Then prepare the debug file such that the PAM module can open it:

root# touch /tmp/u2f-debug.txt

Then perform su on yourself as an unprivileged user:

user$ su user
Password: XXX
user$ ls -l /proc/$$/fd
[...]
l-wx------ 1 user users 64  8. Mai 11:44 3 -> /tmp/u2f-debug.txt

As you can see the new user shell now has an open file descriptor for
the debug file.

CVE-2019-12209: symlink attack on u2f_keys leading to possible information leak
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file `$HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys` is blindly followed by the PAM
module. It can be a symlink pointing to an arbitrary file. The PAM
module only rejects non-regular files and files owned by other users
than root or the to-be-authenticated user. Even these checks are only
made after open()'ing the file, which may already trigger certain logic
in the kernel that is otherwise not reachable to regular users.

If the PAM modules' `debug` option is also enabled then most of the
content of the file is written either to stdout, stderr, syslog or to
the defined debug file.  Therefore this can pose an information leak to
access e.g.  the contents of /etc/shadow, /root/.bash_history or similar
sensitive files. Furthermore the symlink attack can be used to use other
users' u2f_keys files in the authentication process.

For example use the following line in the PAM stack:

```
auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug
```

Then prepare a suitable symlink:

```
user$ mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico
user$ ln -s /etc/shadow ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys
```

Then authenticate the user on a text console:

host login: user
Password: XXX
[...]
debug(pam_u2f):  Authorization line: avahi:!:18019::::::
[...]

Notice the lines from /etc/shadow being output on the terminal.

Bugfixes and Mitigations
------------------------

The bugfix for CVE-2019-12210 is found in [3]. It solves the issue by
passing `O_CLOEXEC` and more conservative flags to related `open()`
calls.

The bugfix for CVE-2019-12209 is found in [4]. It solves the issue by
dropping privileges to the to-be-authenticated user before accessing the
`u2f_keys` file.

Both bugfixes are contained in the upstream release 1.0.8 [5].

A major mitigation for both issues is to remove the `debug` and
`debug_file` options for `pam_u2f.so` in the PAM configuration.
Furthermore enabling the `openasuser` option will mitigate the symlink
attack in CVE-2019-12209.

Timeline and Responsible Disclosure
-----------------------------------

Communication with upstream was responsive and constructive over the
complete timeline.

2019-05-08: I reported the findings privately to the upstream maintainer.
2019-05-20: security@...ico.com has been involved and we worked out and
    reviewed patches together that have been agreed upon by this time.
2019-05-22: Yubico assigned CVEs for the issues.
2019-06-04: This was the established publication date and Yubico
    released a fixed version as planned.

Not sure what else will change with next upstream release, but personally I would prefer to bump the version instead of maintaining patches on top of an old release. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1135727#c6)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2019-05-28 20:35:08 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for IBS integration: This bug (1135727) was mentioned in <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193688> SLE-15 / pam_u2f ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1135727#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-06-04 13:07:47 UTC  ``` Upstream published the findings by now.

The module is typically executed as root and would sometimes
open files or follow symlinks that could be controlled from the
outside.

Drop privileges to the target user before opening any files.

Fixes [CVE-2019-12209](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cf2r-5chq-jmm8 "CVE-2019-12209").

Thanks to Matthias Gerstner of the SUSE Security Team for reporting
the issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1717326#c0)  Gabriel Kihlman    2019-06-05 08:33:18 UTC  ``` Yubico have released version 1.0.8 of pam-u2f containing two security fixes that together could allow a local user to read any file on the filesystem if the debug variable and the debug_file variables have been set in the pam module configuration. Also, the authfile setting file in the users home directory was parsed as root and would follow symlinks which could be abused in many ways.  <https://developers.yubico.com/pam-u2f/Release_Notes.html>  This was discovered by SUSE and they will make a post to oss-security@ soon.

## Description

Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f\_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and does not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other files on the system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the PAM configuration, part of the file contents of a symlink target will be logged, possibly revealing sensitive information.

More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVE-2019-12210

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-12209.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-12211.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12210 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12210)

#### Description

In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug\_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.
