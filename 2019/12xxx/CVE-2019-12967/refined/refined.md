Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12967:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Moolticute application, used to manage the Mooltipass hardware password manager, includes a daemon (`moolticuted`) that listens for WebSocket connections on port 30035. This daemon accepts unauthenticated and unauthorized WebSocket requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of authentication or authorization checks on the WebSocket interface exposed by the `moolticuted` daemon. This allows any client to send commands to the daemon without validation.
*   **Unauthenticated WebSocket Listener:** The daemon creates a local listener that accepts WebSocket data without requiring any form of authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Interaction:** An attacker, by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page, can open a WebSocket channel to the vulnerable daemon and interact with the user's Mooltipass device remotely.
*   **Information Disclosure and Action Execution:** Through this channel, the attacker can obtain information from the device (such as the encrypted database) and/or execute actions on the device.
*   **Potential for Credential Theft:** Under specific conditions, an attacker could orchestrate an attack to obtain a copy of the encrypted database, or potentially steal plain text credentials.
*  **Denial of Service:** An attacker can repeatedly send requests to enter Credentials Management mode to temporarily block legitimate operations, until the user approves the request and enters their PIN.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker can embed JavaScript code in a malicious webpage that opens a WebSocket connection to the user's local `moolticuted` daemon.
*   **Internet Communication:** The vulnerability allows communication with the Mooltipass device over the internet, via the malicious web page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Victim Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious web page.
*   **Network Reachability:** The attacker must be able to reach the user's machine, which is typically reachable within the user's local network. In some cases (OSX), it might also be reachable over the internet.
*   **Moolticute Installation:** The victim must have the Moolticute application running.
*  **User Interaction (Partial):** In order to get access to the encrypted database, the user would need to confirm and enter their pin, but this can be repeatedly requested until it happens.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is confirmed by the vendor and affects versions of Moolticute up to and including v0.42.1 (and possibly earlier).
*   The vulnerability also affects the next-generation version of Mooltipass, with a higher severity, as users can disable confirmations, making it possible to extract all stored passwords.
*   The vulnerability cannot be directly used to extract plaintext passwords from the device, but, in a worst case scenario, could be used to extract an encrypted copy of the database after user interaction.
*   On MacOS, the WebSocket server might be bound to 0.0.0.0, exposing the vulnerability to the Internet in some cases.
*  A Proof of Concept (PoC) was created by the researcher.
