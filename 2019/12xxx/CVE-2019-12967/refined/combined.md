I started ticking differently after taking on the Corelan Advanced Win32 Exploit Development training last month at BruCON 0x0B. I am very delighted and excited about that, and looking forward to putting the new experience to more practical use.

# [CVE-2019-12967] Moolticute: Improper Access Control

Posted on [20.10.201902.05.2021](https://securiteam.io/2019/10/20/cve-2019-12967-moolticute-improper-access-control/) by [Shadi Habbal](https://securiteam.io/author/kerpanic/)

[Mooltipass](https://www.themooltipass.com/) is a hardware-based password manager that is simple to use and provides an added layer of security (say no more to passwords-reuse). The passwords that are stored on the device are encrypted with AES-256, where the encryption key is stored on an external card, that works as a 2FA-token. The key on the card is protected with a 4-digits PIN that is within the range of [0-9A-F].

To manage the passwords on the device, an open source application called [Moolticute](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute) is provided.

In addition, browser plugin(s) are available for an added ease of use.

While using Mooltipass/Moolticute, I was wondering how the plugin is communicating with Moolticute, which works as a proxy between the plugin and Mooltipass. Checking that revealed that Moolticute uses a daemon *moolticuted* that listens for connections on port 30035 locally (except on OSX, where users [reported it accepting remote connections](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/398)). The daemon provided a WebSocket interface where the server receives commands from clients. Cool ð !

In a nutshell: this basically means that any website on the Internet can, while visiting it, open a WebSocket channel with the daemon and start interacting with your device through it, and CVE-2019-12967 was born.

### CVE-2019-12967

The vulnerability affects the latest version of Moolticute, v0.42.1 (and possibly earlier).

The vulnerability allows an attacker, who is able to trick a user into visiting a malicious page, to communicate with Mooltipass remotely without authentication.

By abusing the vulnerability, the attacker would be able to obtain information from the device and/or execute actions on it. Under certain conditions, the attacker is able to orchestrate an attack to obtain a copy of the on-device-encrypted database or steal plaintext credentials from unsuspecting users.

The vulnerability exists due to the way Moolticute create a local listener through the moolticuted daemon thatÂ  accepts unauthenticated/unauthorized WebSockets data. With a computer connected to the Internet where Moolticute is running; an attacker would be able to communicate with the Mooltipass over the Internet by sending data to the WebSocket listener via a malicious webpage.

The vendor has [confirmed the vulnerability which also affects the nextgen version of Mooltipass with a higher severity](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/459) where users will be given the option to disable confirmations, which would have made it possible for attackers to extract every password that is stored on the Mooltipass.

**On a final note:** this cannot be used to extract plaintext passwords. In a worst case scenario, this can be used to extract a copy of the encrypted passwords’ database.

**Update 22.10.2019:** … only after the user has confirmed entering Credentials Management mode and entered his PIN. The PoC below would keep sending requests to enter the Credentials Management mode, temp. blocking other operations, until the user approves the request and enters his PIN. If a request is denied, the PoC sends it again.. if the request times out, the PoC sends it again. I have asked fellow colleages back then about how they would react if they see their device suddenly asking to enter Credentials Management mode and they said

> “we would have probably accepted and entered the PIN to see what’s going on.. probably a glitch in the hardware/software”

### PoC||GTFO

<http://moolticute.securiteam.io/index.html>

### TL;DR

Moolticute is an application that is used to manage passwords stored on a Mooltipass (a hardware-based password manager). Moolticute opens a WS listener on port 30035 which accepts unauthenticated requests from any client. This could be abused by a remote attacker to interact with Mooltipass using the available commands.

Mooltipass is a great alternative for software-based password managers that does not make it possible to enter a secure password on boot or when no supported operating system is present. I <3 Mooltipass and I highly recommend it ð

   Nice work! Felix just told me about your CVE. Not just this one but also CVE-2019-18635. In an earlier version the WS was also bound to 0.0.0.0 interface but this was fixed soon for the Windows and Linux version.

     Glad you liked it.

     As far as I can tell, on Mac it is still bound to 0.0.0.0, not that I have checked that myself, but it’s the last memory I have of the GitHub issue that I have read.

# [CVE-2019-18635] Moolticute: a NULL-pointer dereference

Posted on [27.10.201902.05.2021](https://securiteam.io/2019/10/27/a-null-pointer-dereference/) by [Shadi Habbal](https://securiteam.io/author/kerpanic/)

I started ticking differently after taking on the [Corelan Advanced Win32 Exploit Development](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced/) training last month at [BruCON 0x0B](https://www.brucon.org/2019/brucon-2019-training/). I am very delighted and excited about that, and looking forward to putting the new experience to more practical use.

### A NULL-pointer dereference

According to Wikipedia[Â¹](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Null_Dereference#Description):

> The program can potentially dereference a null pointer, thereby raising a NullPointerException. Null pointer errors are usually the result of one or more programmer assumptions being violated. Most null pointer issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a null pointer dereference, the attacker might be able to use the resulting exception to bypass security logic or to cause the application to reveal debugging information that will be valuable in planning subsequent attacks.
>
> A null-pointer dereference takes place when a pointer with a value of NULL is used as though it pointed to a valid memory area.
>
> Null-pointer dereferences, while common, can generally be found and corrected in a simple way. They will always result in the crash of the process, unless exception handling (on some platforms) is invoked, and even then, little can be done to salvage the process.

### A vulnerable code

The following code was taken from an application that I am currently inspecting. The name of the application and references to the code will not be released for the time being. The code is very common in applications that want to enumerate available USB interfaces each time they change, due to a new USB device being plugged-in or unplugged.

```

dev_detail_data = (SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA_A*) malloc(required_size);
dev_detail_data->cbSize = sizeof(SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA_A);

```

Do you see it, my lovely little NULL-pointer dereference <3 ?

On line #1, memory of size *required\_size* is being allocated and on a successful allocation, a pointer to the allocated memory chunk of type *SP\_DEVICE\_INTERFACE\_DETAIL\_DATA\_A* is returned and stored in *dev\_detail\_data*.

On line #2, the size of the datatype *SP\_DEVICE\_INTERFACE\_DETAIL\_DATA\_A* is calculated and stored at the corresponding address, that is referenced by the pointer we got from line #1.

But what would happen if the allocation fails, i.e. *malloc()* was unable to allocate the *required\_size*? According to the documentation[Â²](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/malloc/), it would then return a NULL pointer.

> On success, a pointer to the memory block allocated by the function.
>
> The type of this pointer is always `void*`, which can be cast to the desired type of data pointer in order to be dereferenceable.
>
> If the function failed to allocate the requested block of memory, a *null pointer* is returned.

That means, if we can force *malloc()* to fail, we would be able to force the application to assign a value to a dereferenced NULL-pointer on line #2 ð

### Exploitability

In userland, this is hardly exploitable and highly dependant on the application’s code, however when running in kernel-mode, it’s a different story.

Exploiting this **effectively** requires running the vulnerable code in kernel-mode & being able to force *malloc()* to fail, by:

* being able to exhaust the free available memory, or
* being able to control the value of *required\_size* to set it to an arbitrary large value.

### Mitigation

Mitigating this is easy. It should not be taken for granted that *malloc()* would return a valid pointer to a memory chunk, therefore it is sufficient to compare the returned value of the pointer to NULL.

### TL;DR

A NULL-pointer dereference occurs when an application uses a NULL-pointer **unintentionally** to read or write from/to a memory address referenced by the pointer. This happens when the pointer has been nullified or when it wasn’t assigned correctly in the first place.

# [CVE-2019-12967] Moolticute: Improper Access Control

Posted on [20.10.201902.05.2021](https://securiteam.io/2019/10/20/cve-2019-12967-moolticute-improper-access-control/) by [Shadi Habbal](https://securiteam.io/author/kerpanic/)

[Mooltipass](https://www.themooltipass.com/) is a hardware-based password manager that is simple to use and provides an added layer of security (say no more to passwords-reuse). The passwords that are stored on the device are encrypted with AES-256, where the encryption key is stored on an external card, that works as a 2FA-token. The key on the card is protected with a 4-digits PIN that is within the range of [0-9A-F].

To manage the passwords on the device, an open source application called [Moolticute](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute) is provided.

In addition, browser plugin(s) are available for an added ease of use.

While using Mooltipass/Moolticute, I was wondering how the plugin is communicating with Moolticute, which works as a proxy between the plugin and Mooltipass. Checking that revealed that Moolticute uses a daemon *moolticuted* that listens for connections on port 30035 locally (except on OSX, where users [reported it accepting remote connections](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/398)). The daemon provided a WebSocket interface where the server receives commands from clients. Cool ð !

In a nutshell: this basically means that any website on the Internet can, while visiting it, open a WebSocket channel with the daemon and start interacting with your device through it, and CVE-2019-12967 was born.

### CVE-2019-12967

The vulnerability affects the latest version of Moolticute, v0.42.1 (and possibly earlier).

The vulnerability allows an attacker, who is able to trick a user into visiting a malicious page, to communicate with Mooltipass remotely without authentication.

By abusing the vulnerability, the attacker would be able to obtain information from the device and/or execute actions on it. Under certain conditions, the attacker is able to orchestrate an attack to obtain a copy of the on-device-encrypted database or steal plaintext credentials from unsuspecting users.

The vulnerability exists due to the way Moolticute create a local listener through the moolticuted daemon thatÂ  accepts unauthenticated/unauthorized WebSockets data. With a computer connected to the Internet where Moolticute is running; an attacker would be able to communicate with the Mooltipass over the Internet by sending data to the WebSocket listener via a malicious webpage.

The vendor has [confirmed the vulnerability which also affects the nextgen version of Mooltipass with a higher severity](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/459) where users will be given the option to disable confirmations, which would have made it possible for attackers to extract every password that is stored on the Mooltipass.

**On a final note:** this cannot be used to extract plaintext passwords. In a worst case scenario, this can be used to extract a copy of the encrypted passwords’ database.

**Update 22.10.2019:** … only after the user has confirmed entering Credentials Management mode and entered his PIN. The PoC below would keep sending requests to enter the Credentials Management mode, temp. blocking other operations, until the user approves the request and enters his PIN. If a request is denied, the PoC sends it again.. if the request times out, the PoC sends it again. I have asked fellow colleages back then about how they would react if they see their device suddenly asking to enter Credentials Management mode and they said

> “we would have probably accepted and entered the PIN to see what’s going on.. probably a glitch in the hardware/software”

### PoC||GTFO

<http://moolticute.securiteam.io/index.html>

### TL;DR

Moolticute is an application that is used to manage passwords stored on a Mooltipass (a hardware-based password manager). Moolticute opens a WS listener on port 30035 which accepts unauthenticated requests from any client. This could be abused by a remote attacker to interact with Mooltipass using the available commands.

Mooltipass is a great alternative for software-based password managers that does not make it possible to enter a secure password on boot or when no supported operating system is present. I <3 Mooltipass and I highly recommend it ð

   Nice work! Felix just told me about your CVE. Not just this one but also CVE-2019-18635. In an earlier version the WS was also bound to 0.0.0.0 interface but this was fixed soon for the Windows and Linux version.

     Glad you liked it.

     As far as I can tell, on Mac it is still bound to 0.0.0.0, not that I have checked that myself, but it’s the last memory I have of the GitHub issue that I have read.

# [CVE-2019-12967] Moolticute: Improper Access Control

Posted on [20.10.201902.05.2021](https://securiteam.io/2019/10/20/cve-2019-12967-moolticute-improper-access-control/) by [Shadi Habbal](https://securiteam.io/author/kerpanic/)

[Mooltipass](https://www.themooltipass.com/) is a hardware-based password manager that is simple to use and provides an added layer of security (say no more to passwords-reuse). The passwords that are stored on the device are encrypted with AES-256, where the encryption key is stored on an external card, that works as a 2FA-token. The key on the card is protected with a 4-digits PIN that is within the range of [0-9A-F].

To manage the passwords on the device, an open source application called [Moolticute](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute) is provided.

In addition, browser plugin(s) are available for an added ease of use.

While using Mooltipass/Moolticute, I was wondering how the plugin is communicating with Moolticute, which works as a proxy between the plugin and Mooltipass. Checking that revealed that Moolticute uses a daemon *moolticuted* that listens for connections on port 30035 locally (except on OSX, where users [reported it accepting remote connections](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/398)). The daemon provided a WebSocket interface where the server receives commands from clients. Cool ð !

In a nutshell: this basically means that any website on the Internet can, while visiting it, open a WebSocket channel with the daemon and start interacting with your device through it, and CVE-2019-12967 was born.

### CVE-2019-12967

The vulnerability affects the latest version of Moolticute, v0.42.1 (and possibly earlier).

The vulnerability allows an attacker, who is able to trick a user into visiting a malicious page, to communicate with Mooltipass remotely without authentication.

By abusing the vulnerability, the attacker would be able to obtain information from the device and/or execute actions on it. Under certain conditions, the attacker is able to orchestrate an attack to obtain a copy of the on-device-encrypted database or steal plaintext credentials from unsuspecting users.

The vulnerability exists due to the way Moolticute create a local listener through the moolticuted daemon thatÂ  accepts unauthenticated/unauthorized WebSockets data. With a computer connected to the Internet where Moolticute is running; an attacker would be able to communicate with the Mooltipass over the Internet by sending data to the WebSocket listener via a malicious webpage.

The vendor has [confirmed the vulnerability which also affects the nextgen version of Mooltipass with a higher severity](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/459) where users will be given the option to disable confirmations, which would have made it possible for attackers to extract every password that is stored on the Mooltipass.

**On a final note:** this cannot be used to extract plaintext passwords. In a worst case scenario, this can be used to extract a copy of the encrypted passwords’ database.

**Update 22.10.2019:** … only after the user has confirmed entering Credentials Management mode and entered his PIN. The PoC below would keep sending requests to enter the Credentials Management mode, temp. blocking other operations, until the user approves the request and enters his PIN. If a request is denied, the PoC sends it again.. if the request times out, the PoC sends it again. I have asked fellow colleages back then about how they would react if they see their device suddenly asking to enter Credentials Management mode and they said

> “we would have probably accepted and entered the PIN to see what’s going on.. probably a glitch in the hardware/software”

### PoC||GTFO

<http://moolticute.securiteam.io/index.html>

### TL;DR

Moolticute is an application that is used to manage passwords stored on a Mooltipass (a hardware-based password manager). Moolticute opens a WS listener on port 30035 which accepts unauthenticated requests from any client. This could be abused by a remote attacker to interact with Mooltipass using the available commands.

Mooltipass is a great alternative for software-based password managers that does not make it possible to enter a secure password on boot or when no supported operating system is present. I <3 Mooltipass and I highly recommend it ð

   Nice work! Felix just told me about your CVE. Not just this one but also CVE-2019-18635. In an earlier version the WS was also bound to 0.0.0.0 interface but this was fixed soon for the Windows and Linux version.

Checking that revealed that Moolticute uses a daemon *moolticuted* that listens for connections on port 30035 locally (except on OSX, where users [reported it accepting remote connections](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/398)). The daemon provided a WebSocket interface where the server receives commands from clients. Cool ð !

In a nutshell: this basically means that any website on the Internet can, while visiting it, open a WebSocket channel with the daemon and start interacting with your device through it, and CVE-2019-12967 was born.

### CVE-2019-12967

The vulnerability affects the latest version of Moolticute, v0.42.1 (and possibly earlier).

The vulnerability allows an attacker, who is able to trick a user into visiting a malicious page, to communicate with Mooltipass remotely without authentication.

By abusing the vulnerability, the attacker would be able to obtain information from the device and/or execute actions on it. Under certain conditions, the attacker is able to orchestrate an attack to obtain a copy of the on-device-encrypted database or steal plaintext credentials from unsuspecting users.

The vulnerability exists due to the way Moolticute create a local listener through the moolticuted daemon thatÂ  accepts unauthenticated/unauthorized WebSockets data. With a computer connected to the Internet where Moolticute is running; an attacker would be able to communicate with the Mooltipass over the Internet by sending data to the WebSocket listener via a malicious webpage.

The vendor has [confirmed the vulnerability which also affects the nextgen version of Mooltipass with a higher severity](https://github.com/mooltipass/moolticute/issues/459) where users will be given the option to disable confirmations, which would have made it possible for attackers to extract every password that is stored on the Mooltipass.

**On a final note:** this cannot be used to extract plaintext passwords. In a worst case scenario, this can be used to extract a copy of the encrypted passwords’ database.

**Update 22.10.2019:** … only after the user has confirmed entering Credentials Management mode and entered his PIN. The PoC below would keep sending requests to enter the Credentials Management mode, temp. blocking other operations, until the user approves the request and enters his PIN. If a request is denied, the PoC sends it again.. if the request times out, the PoC sends it again. I have asked fellow colleages back then about how they would react if they see their device suddenly asking to enter Credentials Management mode and they said

> “we would have probably accepted and entered the PIN to see what’s going on.. probably a glitch in the hardware/software”

### PoC||GTFO

### TL;DR

Moolticute is an application that is used to manage passwords stored on a Mooltipass (a hardware-based password manager). Moolticute opens a WS listener on port 30035 which accepts unauthenticated requests from any client. This could be abused by a remote attacker to interact with Mooltipass using the available commands.

Mooltipass is a great alternative for software-based password managers that does not make it possible to enter a secure password on boot or when no supported operating system is present. I <3 Mooltipass and I highly recommend it ð

   Nice work! Felix just told me about your CVE. Not just this one but also CVE-2019-18635. In an earlier version the WS was also bound to 0.0.0.0 interface but this was fixed soon for the Windows and Linux version.

     Glad you liked it.

     As far as I can tell, on Mac it is still bound to 0.0.0.0, not that I have checked that myself, but it’s the last memory I have of the GitHub issue that I have read.

Welcome to our new blog.

My first blog post dates back to 27.10.2008, Wow! 11 years ago, when I used to post randomly about different technical stuff, but different times call for different measures.

From now on, I will be blogging about stuff that only matters /!\

Senior Penetration Tester and Win32 Reverse Engineer (a former Cracker \*cough\*).
OSCP, OSWE, OSED, eWPTX, eMAPT certified. Punished once at the "Advanced Win32 Exploit Development" training by corelanc0d3r, and again at the "Advanced Fuzzing & Crash Analysis" course by Richard Johnson.
I manage to identify exotic security vulnerabilities and logic errors â and I do it with passion. My strengths include curiosity and a sense of humor.
When I am not hacking stuff, that's usually when I am asleep.
