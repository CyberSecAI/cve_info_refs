    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Use of uninitialized value in the `ReadPANGOImage` function.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Use of uninitialized value"
      ],
      "impact": "A specially crafted image could lead to a denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution due to the use of an uninitialized value. Depending on the context this may or may not result in arbitrary code execution",

      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted image file for processing by ImageMagick.",
        "user_interaction": "User interaction is required in the sense that a user or process must open the crafted file.  SUSE also lists this as no user interaction required and describes the user as 'low privileged user'"
