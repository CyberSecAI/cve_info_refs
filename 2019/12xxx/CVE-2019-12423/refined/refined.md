  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Apache CXF OpenId Connect JWK Keys service returns all keys from a JWK keystore file, including private and secret keys, when configured to use a JWK keystore.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The service returns all keys from a JWK keystore file without proper filtering of private or secret credentials.",
      "The service returns secret keys which should not be returned"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of private keys or secret keys configured in the signature keystore file when the service returns keys from a JWK keystore file. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The service is accessed by a client to obtain the public keys in JWK format via HTTP, or HTTPS."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker with access to the service can request keys and may obtain the private keys and secret keys."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "In CXF 3.3.5 and 3.2.12, an alias is now required to specify the key id in the JWK file, and only the specified key is returned.",
     "Private key information is omitted by default.",
     "Secret keys ('oct' keys) are not returned."
