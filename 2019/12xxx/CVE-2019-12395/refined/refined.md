Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing login check in the `org.dynmap.servlet.MapStorageResourceHandler.java` file of the Dynmap plugin. This oversight allows unauthorized access to map images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the failure to enforce login authentication before serving map resources. Specifically, the `MapStorageResourceHandler` does not properly check if a user is logged in when the `login-required` setting is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Authentication:** A remote attacker can bypass the login authentication mechanism.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can view map images that are supposed to be protected and require user authentication, potentially exposing sensitive game-related information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Direct Resource Request:** Attackers can directly request map resources that should require login authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Dynmap server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
- The vulnerability exists within the `org.dynmap.servlet.MapStorageResourceHandler.java` file.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure a user is logged in before serving map resources when login is required. The code change in the commit adds a check using `request.getSession(true).getAttribute(LoginServlet.USERID_ATTRIB)` to verify if a user ID exists in the session. If not, the request is denied.
- The vulnerable code did not correctly implement the login check at the handler level allowing access to resources without proper authorization
