    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2019-12529",
      "Description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 2.x through 2.7.STABLE9, 3.x through 3.5.28, and 4.x through 4.7. When Squid is configured to use Basic Authentication, the Proxy-Authorization header is parsed via uudecode. uudecode determines how many bytes will be decoded by iterating over the input and checking its table. The length is then used to start decoding the string. There are no checks to ensure that the length it calculates isn't greater than the input buffer. This leads to adjacent memory being decoded as well. An attacker would not be able to retrieve the decoded data unless the Squid maintainer had configured the display of usernames on error pages."

        "Data": {
          "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in Squid's handling of the Proxy-Authorization header when using Basic Authentication. Specifically, the `uudecode` function does not validate if the calculated length for decoding is within the bounds of the input buffer.",
          "Weaknesses": [
            "Heap-based buffer over-read",
            "Insufficient input validation"
          ],
          "Impact": "An attacker could cause Squid to over-read from the heap, potentially exposing sensitive information present in adjacent memory, such as usernames, if configured to display on error pages. However, the attacker cannot directly retrieve the over-read data unless the error pages display usernames.",
          "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted `Proxy-Authorization` header in an HTTP request.",
          "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a Squid server configured with Basic Authentication. No special privileges are required other than the ability to make HTTP requests."

        "Data": {
          "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Squid parses the Proxy-Authorization header when Basic Authentication is used. Specifically, the uudecode function calculates a length to decode, but doesn't verify that length against the input buffer, potentially reading beyond buffer bounds.",

          "Impact": "The vulnerability allows information disclosure through a heap-based buffer over-read. An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from adjacent memory, especially if the Squid maintainer has enabled the display of usernames on error pages. The attacker would not be able to retrieve the data if username display is disabled.",
          "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out via a crafted Proxy-Authorization header in an HTTP request to the Squid proxy.",
