Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the CSV Injection vulnerability in Workday:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when exporting data to CSV or Excel formats. Specifically, the application fails to escape fields that begin with an equals sign (=), which is the indicator for a formula in spreadsheet applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection:** The primary weakness is the injection of spreadsheet formulas into CSV or Excel files. This occurs because user input is directly included in the output without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (potential):** By injecting malicious formulas, an attacker could potentially achieve remote code execution on the client's machine. This could happen through the use of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) which allows formulas to execute system commands.
*   **Data Leakage:** Maliciously crafted hyperlinks can be injected into the spreadsheet that could redirect the user to a malicious location or leak information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Contact Form Fields:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious Excel formulas into any of the contact form fields. This data is then exported to a CSV or Excel file.
*  **Export Functionality:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator or HR personnel exports the data to an Excel or CSV file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Input Data:** The attacker must be able to input data into contact form fields that are later included in a CSV/Excel export.
*   **Knowledge of Excel Formulas:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of Excel formulas that can be used to achieve malicious goals (e.g. `=rundll32|'URL.dll,OpenURL calc.exe'!A`).
* **Target User Interaction**: The target user needs to open the malicious CSV file using spreadsheet software.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided example formula `=rundll32|'URL.dll,OpenURL calc.exe'!A` demonstrates a potential for code execution.
* The suggested solution is to escape fields beginning with "=" when exporting to CSV or Excel.
