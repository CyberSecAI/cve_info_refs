- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of URLs within the `remarkable` library. Specifically, the library fails to adequately sanitize or validate URLs, allowing for the injection of malicious code via the `javascript:` scheme. The parser does not strip unprintable characters around the URL scheme.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a bypass of URL validation, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `remarkable` library incorrectly parses URLs, failing to detect and block the `javascript:` scheme when it's prepended with an unprintable character (`\x0e`).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to XSS, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could enable a wide range of malicious activities, including stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted markdown input containing a link with a malicious URL. By including an unprintable character (e.g., `\x0e`) before the `javascript:` scheme in a markdown link, an attacker can bypass the library's URL sanitization and inject malicious javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject crafted markdown content that is processed by the vulnerable version of the `remarkable` library.
