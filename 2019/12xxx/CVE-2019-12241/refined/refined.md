Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-12241

**Vulnerable Plugin:** Carts Guru (version 1.4.5)

**Root Cause:** Insecure deserialization of attacker-controlled data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The plugin uses the `unserialize()` function on data obtained from the `cartsguru-source` cookie without proper sanitization. This cookie's value can be controlled by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server. This is because `unserialize()` can lead to code execution if the serialized data contains objects that have the magic method `__wakeup` or `__destruct`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By setting a malicious serialized payload in the `cartsguru-source` cookie and making a request to a page that triggers the `woocommerce_order_status_changed` hook.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set HTTP cookies for the target domain. No authentication is required

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `classes/wc-cartsguru-event-handler.php` file, specifically within the `handle_order` function.
- The `woocommerce_order_status_changed` action triggers the `handle_order` function. The plugin retrieves a cookie value named `cartsguru-source` and directly passes it to the `unserialize()` function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content mentions the possibility of more instances of insecure deserialization within the plugin but this was the only one focused on.
- This vulnerability is considered high risk due to its potential for arbitrary code execution.
