We were searching for a store engine that was flexible, customisable and open-sourced, with no need of having everything covered by plug-ins . We've tested several PHP-based technologies and came to the conclusion the language itself isn't very well suited for such projects .We've tried nopCommerce, but SQL Server, which was underneath, seemed overweight. Then we've stumbled upon GrandNode. The choice was quite obvious. Required a significant amount of work, to make it look and work as we wanted, but it was worth it.

Paweł Karczewski*[EcoEthics.pl](https://ecoethics.pl)*

We were looking for an eCommerce solution that was created in .NET Core technologies to fit into our ecosystem. We found and trusted GrandNode, and we now recommend it. Due to the fact that it is open-source, and a commercial company is responsible for the development, we do not worry that we will be left with a closed, non-extensible solution in 2 years.

Kamil Serwus*[M2T sp. z o.o. sp. k.](https://m2t.com.pl)*

I was looking for an auction system that I could implement for my customer. GrandNode proved to be the best .net ecommerce platform, on the open source software market. The system's capabilities exceeded my expectations. GrandNode is an advanced e-commerce platform on which you will create, among others, an efficient online store, auction system, reservation system or e-learning platform. I highly recommend GranNode, it's the best solution for e-business.

GrandNode is a good platform with a lot of features include out of the box without change all backend, you could base your business on it and introduce your branding pretty easily... If you're more a player, you could include everything you want by using their plugins philosophy (for payments, widget, shipping, etc..)

Cédric Radicia*[Zefir-Outillage.fr](http://zefir-outillage.fr/)*

GrandNode is a very intuitive platform. In the case of any questions, you receive the fast, professional and clear response and priceless support in incoming challenges. The cooperation which I can totally recommend for everyone!

Sure thing I would recommend GrandNode. If you’re looking after e-commerce software for your shop and don’t want to go with insecure and bloated Magento, Prestashop or other things glued together in PHP (juck!) which will give you headache from constant CVEs and failures then this thing is for you (remember: it’s .NET Core!). If you need to add some features – you can, maybe not in the plug-and-play fashion but it’s doable alright in reasonable amount of time. Oh and it’s open source and free, which is a value on it’s own in era of hosted solution with “best value” monthly subscription fees.

Fastest eCommerce platform on market! Our online users and customers are stunned with NextArt speed. We could insert millions of products and images in our system with no impact to the system performance! Lots of free plugins which means that you don't have to purchase tons of external plugins like it's in different e-commerce software. Using default theme we could use the power of minimalism in our UI design.
