Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the incorrect detection of the RTF file syntax by the Cisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect parsing of RTF file syntax.
- Failure to properly enforce configured Malware and File Policies for RTF files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured Malware and File Policies for RTF files.
- This could potentially allow malicious RTF files to pass through the targeted device undetected, leading to further compromise.
- The impact is limited to Integrity, with no impact on Confidentiality or Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attacker can send a malicious RTF file through the targeted device.
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- No privileges are required to exploit (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- The scope is changed (S:C), implying the vulnerability in one component can impact others.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable Cisco device.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious RTF file that exploits the incorrect parsing of the RTF file syntax by the Cisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine.
- No special privileges are required to execute this attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Cisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine, which impacts a wide range of Cisco products.
- The vulnerability is also present in the open-source Snort project.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability.
- The CVSS score is 5.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
