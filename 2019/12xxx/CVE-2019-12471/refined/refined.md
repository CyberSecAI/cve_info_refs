Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-12471:

*   **Vulnerability:** Loading user JavaScript from a non-existent account allows anyone to create the account and inject arbitrary JavaScript (XSS) into users' sessions.
*   **Root Cause:** When a user includes a script from `User:Foo/bar.js` (via `importScript`), and the account `User:Foo` doesn't exist, anyone can register the `User:Foo` account and control the content of the JavaScript file.  Any user loading the script would then execute the attacker's JavaScript code.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker registers a user account that doesn't exist but is being referenced by a javascript import.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of users who load the malicious script. This could lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by disallowing the loading of JS/CSS/JSON subpages from unregistered users. This was accomplished by making requests to such pages return a 403 error.
*   **Affected Versions:** MediaWiki versions 1.27, 1.30, and 1.31
