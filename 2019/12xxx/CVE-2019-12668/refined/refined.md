Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input validation of the banner parameters passed to the web server in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface.
- The attacker could gain access to sensitive browser-based information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, authenticated attacker can craft a malicious banner parameter and save it via the web interface.
- The attacker can then convince a user of the web interface to access a malicious link.
- The attacker can intercept a user's request for the affected web interface and inject malicious code into the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface of the affected device.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and save the malicious banner parameter.
- The attacker needs to be able to either trick another user into accessing a malicious link or intercept a legitimate request to inject the malicious code.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable banner parameter is configured using the `ip http banner` and `banner login` commands.
- The HTTP Server feature must be enabled for the device to be vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is present in the web framework code.
- There are no workarounds.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the issue.
- The advisory includes a link to a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker, to help customers determine their exposure and identify fixes.
- The vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software.
