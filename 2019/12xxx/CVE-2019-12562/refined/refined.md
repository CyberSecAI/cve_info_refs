        "rootCause": "The application does not properly sanitize user input in the 'Display Name' field during user registration, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.",

        "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the admin's browser session. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application, including creation of superusers and uploading webshells to the target server, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).",

Successful exploitation allows the attacker to fully compromise the target website by creating a superuser account and achieving remote code execution through a web shell.",
