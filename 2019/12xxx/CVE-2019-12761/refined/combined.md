Proof-of-Concept for python-xdg 0.25 Python code injection (CVE-2019-12761)

 [Raw](/dhondta/b45cd41f4186110a354dc7272916feba/raw/7ce80065d174f4767246e9100adff6fd84fa6727/README.md)

### [CVE-2019-12761](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12761)

### Description

A code injection issue was discovered in PyXDG before 0.26 via crafted Python code in a Category element of a Menu XML document in a .menu file. XDG\_CONFIG\_DIRS must be set up to trigger xdg.Menu.parse parsing within the directory containing this file. This is due to a lack of sanitization in xdg/Menu.py before an eval call.

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS

[CVE-2019-12761  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-12761) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-94  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `pyxdg` to version 0.26 or higher.

## Overview

[pyxdg](https://pypi.org/project/pyxdg/) contains implementations of freedesktop.org standards in python.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Execution
via the `xdg.Menu.parse()` function. When it is possible to craft an evil `menu` file with a `Category` node containing Python injected code. Then it is possible to update `xdg_config_dirs` with its location folder, the evil menu can be parsed and an attacker could exploit the vulnerability. This is due to a lack of sanitization in `xdg/Menu.py`. When the evil `menu` file is parsed, the injected code is executed because of an unsanitized `eval()`.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

Package        : pyxdg
Version        : 0.25-4+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12761
Debian Bug     : #930099

It was discovered that there was a code injection issue in PyXDG, a
library used to locate "FreeDesktop.org" configuration/cache/etc.
directories.

A lack of sanitisation allowed arbitrary Python code embedded in
the Category element of a Menu XML document in a .menu file to
be executed.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in pyxdg version
0.25-4+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pyxdg packages.

Regards,
