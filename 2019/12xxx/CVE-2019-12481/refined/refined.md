Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1: Null pointer dereference in `DumpTrackInfo@filedump.c:2058-65`**

*   **Root Cause:** The code attempts to access `esd->decoderConfig->streamType` without ensuring that `esd->decoderConfig` is not NULL. In certain cases, `esd->decoderConfig` can be NULL, leading to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper null pointer checks before accessing members of the `decoderConfig` structure.
*   **Impact:** Program crash due to segmentation fault.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Processing a specially crafted MP4 file that results in a NULL `decoderConfig`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4 file.

**Vulnerability 2: Null pointer dereference in `gf_isom_get_original_format_type@drm_sample.c:540-33`**

*   **Root Cause:** The code attempts to access `sinf->original_format` without ensuring that `sinf` is not NULL. In certain cases,  `sinf` can be NULL leading to a null pointer dereference.
*   **Weakness:**  Lack of proper null pointer checks before accessing the `original_format` member of `sinf`.
*  **Impact:** Program crash due to segmentation fault.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Processing a specially crafted MP4 file that results in a NULL `sinf`.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4 file.

**Vulnerability 3: Null pointer dereference in `GetESD@track.c:271-28`**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to the first vulnerability, the code accesses `esd->decoderConfig->streamType` without verifying that `esd->decoderConfig` is not NULL.
*   **Weakness:** Missing null pointer check for `esd->decoderConfig` before accessing its members.
*   **Impact:** Program crash due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted MP4 file that causes a NULL `decoderConfig` pointer to be accessed.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4 file.

**Vulnerability 4: Heap-based buffer overflow in `ReadGF_IPMPX_RemoveToolNotificationListener@ipmpx_code.c:1103-54`**

*   **Root Cause:** The code reads `eventTypeCount` from the bitstream and then attempts to read `eventTypeCount` number of event types into a fixed-size buffer `p->eventType`. If `eventTypeCount` is larger than the buffer size, it leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
*  **Weakness:** Lack of bounds checking when writing event types to the `eventType` buffer, which is allocated on heap.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution or program crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Attack Vector:** Providing a crafted MP4 file with a large value for `eventTypeCount`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4 file with a crafted `eventTypeCount`.

**Summary of CVE-2019-12481**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2019-12481 is associated with three separate vulnerabilities, two of which are null pointer dereferences and one is a heap-based buffer overflow. All vulnerabilities are in the `gpac` multimedia framework and can be triggered by processing specially crafted MP4 files.

Specifically, the Debian security advisory (DLA 1841-1) mentions that these vulnerabilities have been fixed in version `0.5.0+svn5324~dfsg1-1+deb8u4` of the `gpac` package for Debian 8 "Jessie".
