Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12792:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient shell escaping within the `UploadHandler.php` script of the Vesta Control Panel. Specifically, the script uses `'...'` for shell escaping instead of `escapeshellarg`. This allows for command injection via the filename during file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Because the filename provided by the user during file uploads is not properly sanitized before being used in an `exec` command, an attacker can inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The code uses `basename` function but does not prevent command injection.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  A regular user can exploit this vulnerability to execute commands with the privileges of the `admin` user, which has significant control over the VestaCP system. The `admin` user can then escalate to `root` via other commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A regular user can escalate their privileges to `admin` and subsequently to `root`, granting them full control of the server.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Once the attacker has root privileges, they can access, modify, or delete any data on the server.
*   **System Compromise:** Attackers can fully compromise the server, potentially using it for further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/upload/UploadHandler.php` endpoint.
*   **Filename Manipulation:** The core of the attack involves manipulating the filename of the uploaded file to inject shell commands.
*   **Exploiting the `exec` function:** The vulnerability relies on the improper usage of the `exec` function in PHP which leads to command injection

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Vesta Control Panel instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Vesta Control Panel version 0.9.8-24, and also in HestiaCP 1.0.4. HestiaCP promptly fixed it in version 1.0.5.
*   The advisory provides specific examples on how to use `curl` to exploit the vulnerability, including a method to execute a `sleep` command as proof of concept, and a more advanced method to execute arbitrary commands using base32 encoding.
*   The advisory outlines two methods to escalate from the `admin` user to `root`, using the `v-start-service` command and cron.
*   The advisory lists multiple other instances of similar code injection vulnerabilities in the VestaCP code base.
*   The issue was initially reported to VestaCP developers who didn't respond, leading to the public disclosure.
*   A fix was eventually made available by the VestaCP team in version 0.9.8-25.
