| [CVE-2025-24337](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24337) | WriteFreely through 0.15.1, when MySQL is used, allows local users to discover credentials by reading config.ini. | -- | Jan 20, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-24014](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24014) | Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A segmentation fault was found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn\'t show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn\'t been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043. | -- | Jan 21, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-24013](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24013) | CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. Prior to 4.5.8, CodeIgniter lacked proper header validation for its name and value. The potential attacker can construct deliberately malformed headers with Header class. This could disrupt application functionality, potentially causing errors or generating invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests might lead to a DoS scenario if a remote service’s web application firewall interprets them as malicious and blocks further communication with the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.8. | -- | Jan 20, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-24010](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24010) | Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Vite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections.

SUMMARY

RUGGEDCOM Win is affected by multiple security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow an
attacker to leverage various attacks, e.g. to execute arbitrary code over the network.

The vulnerabilities affect the underlying Wind River VxWorks network stack and were recently patched by
Wind River.

Siemens is working on updates for the affected products, and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures
until ﬁxes are available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block TCP trafﬁc to the IP address of the management interface

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-12255

By sending specially crafted TCP packets with a manipulated TCP Urgent Pointer to a device, an
attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code. Network access, but no authentication and no user
interaction is needed to conduct this attack.
