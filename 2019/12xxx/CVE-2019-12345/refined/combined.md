## Description

Create your hostel, small hotel, or BnB site with WordPress.

Hostel is online booking system with easy back-end management.

You can publish the booking forms, room calendars, and room lists with shortcodes so the plugin fits any WordPress theme.

### Features

* Manage your booking mode: accept Paypal, manual payments, or don’t allow online booking
* Manage email notifications
* Manage rooms, beds, and prices
* Set unavailable dates when you are on vacations or just don’t want to accept guests in some rooms
* Manage bookings, process payments, contact customers
* List your rooms by using shortcodes
* Supports iCal / .ics to synchronize bookings with online systems. You can export and import bookings to/from all popular booking sites like Booking.com, AirBnB.com, Hotels.com etc.
* Localization / translation – ready
* Mobile / touch – friendly

There are more and better features + premium support in the PRO version. Check it on our new site: [wp-hostel.com](http://wp-hostel.com "Hostel PRO")

### Getting Started

1. Go to Hostel link in your admin menu to manage your rooms and rates.
2. Use the shortcodes to install a list of your rooms or to add the booking code to a post or page where you have described your rooms.
3. Set up unavailable dates if you have such.

### Shortcodes

* [wphostel-list] will display a table with your available rooms. A date selector on the top lets the user choose dates of their visit and then the rooms list is updated. If you have enabled booking in your Hostel settings page, the table will also show “Book” button when appropriate. The button will automaically load the booking form. You can pass the attribute “max\_days” to specify the maximum day interval that can be selected to show the table.
* [wphostel-booking] displays a generic booking form with a drop-down selector for choosing room, and a date selector. If you use the [wphostel-list] shortcode you most probably do not need this one because the booking form is automatically generated.

For translating the plugin check the Help page under the Hostel menu in your administration.

## Installation

1. Unzip the contents and upload the entire `hostel` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Go to “Hostel” in your menu and manage the plugin

## FAQ

### Can I import bookings from sites like Booking.com etc?

Yes. Each room supports multiple iCal URLs. You can get the iCal URL from your control panel at the sites that provide it. Most popular booking sites do provide you with iCal URL

### I have problems with receiving emails

Hostel just sends the emails to your WP installaiton so if emails are not delivered this is most likely a problem with your installation. We suggest installing a free plugin like [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) or [Postman SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/) to test and improve your emails delivery. Hostel will automatically send its emails through any SMTP plugin you have installed.

Well I’ve spent hours on the big booking plugins out there. And each of them have proved SO complicated when trying to simply allow people to book a bed or bunk in a hostel – NOT book the whole room. FINALLY- here’s a sweet and simply plugin that does it all- AND it works with Elementor. They also keep updating it so it has all the bells and whistles you’d want for a hostel. 10 out of 10 to the developers!

It is nice, compact and functional but I don’t know if I would be ready to pay 77 USD for a plugin that doesn’t support rates, I mean do you know that most of the places are working seasonally and they need to change the price of a bed based on the season? So when you will add this feature I’ll think about give you a better review. EDIT: After the nice reply from the support team to my review I decided to give 5 star.

What I like is how the admin controls of this plugin is not overwhelming, but that’s it! It gets very basic, organizing content and images can be like meh… okay. The short code didn’t work for me to top it off. I’m giving it a generous 2 stars, needs way more improvement.

The Hostel Pro plug-in allows our hostel to sell and manage our rooms on-line. By linking it up with PayPal, we can take a partial booking fee straight away and the plugin emails our guests how much to pay when they get here. (you can also take full payment via PayPal if you want, this is just our method of booking rooms)
Any problems/ issues I have had were quickly solved by emailing them and I hope more wordpress users realize how helpful this plug-in is for small hotels or hostels all over the world.
