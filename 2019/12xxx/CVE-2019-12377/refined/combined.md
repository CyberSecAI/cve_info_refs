# LANDesk Management Server - Multiple Vulnerabilities

#### Multiple vulnerabilities of varying severity have been identified in LDMS 10.0.1.168 Service Update 5

May 25, 2019

The vendor has been notified of these vulnerabilities. This version is no longer being actively developed (end of life 12/31/2018), so these vulnerabilities will not be patched. However, fixes will be released for supported versions where applicable. These vulnerabilities affect the following LDMS modules:

* Managed endpoint security settings
* Provisioning
* Endpoint encryption / Mac file vault / Device Adminsitration
* Device Inventory / Vulnerability Management

These vulnerabilities range in severity from inconsequential to critical, and some can be used together to gain full administrative control of the LDMS server and/or a full takeover of managed endpoints.

A list of weaknesses found is as follows:

* [(CWE-284) Improper Access Control](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)
* [(CWE-213) Intentional Information Disclosure](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/213.html)
* [(CWE-548) Information Exposure through Directory Listing](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/548.html)
* [(CWE-434) Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)
* [(CWE-89) Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* [(CWE-327) Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)
* [(CWE-261) Weak Cryptography for Passwords](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/261.html)
* [(CWE-321) Use of a Hard-coded Cryptographic Key](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)
* **Additional unpublished weaknesses\***

A list of confirmed vulnerabilities derived from those weaknesses is as follows:

* [[CVE-2019-12375] LANDesk Management Server - Open Directories](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-open-directories/)
* [[CVE-2019-12373] LANDesk Management Server - Administrator Password Disclosure](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-administrator-password-disclosure/)
* [[CVE-2019-12377] LANDesk Management Server - Arbitrary File Upload](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-arbitrary-file-upload/)
* [[CVE-2019-12376] LANDesk Management Server - Hard-coded Encryption Key](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-hard-coded-encryption-key/)
* [[CVE-2019-12374] LANDesk Management Server - SQL Injection](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-sql-injection/)
* **Additional unpublished vulnerabilities\***

*\*At least one additional vulnerability is confirmed to affect newer versions of LDMS. I will not publish these vulnerabilities until the vendor confirms that they have been patched.*

# [CVE-2019-12377] LANDesk Management Server - Arbitrary File Upload

#### A vulnerable web API endpoint in LDMS 10.0.1.168 Service Update 5 allows arbitrary file upload, which may lead to arbitrary remote code execution

May 25, 2019

When a LANDesk managed endpoint is reporting inventory and patch level information to the core server, it leverages a web API endpoint found at https://<coreserver>/upl/async\_upload.asp. This endpoint does not properly sanitize user-provided values, which allows for an attacker to both control the uploaded file extension and the uploaded file location.

As this is an ASP.NET web page, we can simply open the file in a text editor to see the vulnerable code. I opened it using Notepad++ to take a look.

The script retrieves the filename through HTTP GET/POST parameters on the request, shown here:

![GetRequestValue.png](/media/images/GetRequestValue.original.png)

It then saves the file using a fixed extension (.SCN) and a random filename, which provides some measure of security. Ideally, an attacker should not be able to control the extension or name of an uploaded file. You can see the temporary filename assignment here:

![SavePostAsFile.png](/media/images/SavePostAsFile.original.png)

The service finally renames the file using the original filename and uploaded extension, in addition to a couple of other user-controlled parameters. This means the attacker has full control of both the extension and the name of the uploaded file. You can see this operation here:

![VulnerableRename.png](/media/images/VulnerableRename.original.png)

On line 109, the script renames the uploaded file using the information originally provided by the uploader. This completely negates the protections offered by the module used at line 55. Paired with the open directories on the LDMS core server (discussed here: [LANDesk Management Server - Open Directories](/gnzlabs-blog/landesk-management-server-open-directories/)), an attacker can leverage this mechanism to upload an ASP.NET web shell into a location of the attacker's choice. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server using the service account permissions, which can lead to full core server compromise.

The vendor has been notified of this issue, and has confirmed that LDMS version 10.0.1.168 SU 5 is no longer supported. Thus, this vulnerability will not be patched.
