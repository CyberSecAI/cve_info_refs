Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability is triggered by an `and` instruction operating on a memory location. Specifically, the instruction `and byte ptr [eax+edi],0` attempts to write to an address calculated by `eax + edi`, where edi has the value of `fe95ffff` and the address `eax + edi` is invalid, causing a crash.
*   **Weakness:** Invalid memory access due to an incorrect address calculation in the `and` instruction.
*   **Impact:** Application crash due to memory access violation.
*  **Attack vector:** Fuzzing
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to provide malformed input that leads to the described state

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability is located in `ntdll!RtlQueueWorkItem+0x5e3`, specifically at the instruction `xor dword ptr [esi],eax`. The memory pointed to by `esi` (0x04fffff8) is being XORed with the value in `eax` (0x5971993e) which leads to an invalid memory access.
*   **Weakness:** Invalid memory access due to writing to an incorrect address
*   **Impact:** Application crash due to memory access violation
*  **Attack vector:** Fuzzing
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to provide malformed input that leads to the described state

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerabilities were found through fuzzing the DeviceNet Builder software by DeltaElectronics.
