Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12314:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a security advisory for CVE-2019-12314, which confirms the relevance of the information.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Maconomy components handle URLs and access files.
- Specifically, it's possible to craft URLs to access files outside of the component's configured search path using the Maconomy scripting language (MScript).
- This is due to insufficient input validation or sanitization of the requested file paths.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include local files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Inadequate Path Validation:** The system fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths in the URL.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain text from the first line of arbitrary files on the web server. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or even credentials, depending on the files accessible by the webserver user.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** By gaining access to sensitive files or configurations, an attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability for further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious HTTP requests with manipulated URLs.
- **Direct File Path Access:** The crafted URLs are designed to directly access files located outside the intended application path.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Maconomy server.
- **Knowledge of the application's URL structure:** Some knowledge of the application's URL format is needed to craft the exploit.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can likely be exploited without authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Components:** The advisory lists the following affected components:
    *   Maconomy MScript
    *   Maconomy Workspace Client
    *   Touch for Maconomy
    *   Maconomy Portal (specific versions)
*   **Mitigation:** The provided mitigation involves configuring an error script for all Maconomy components. This error script is triggered when invalid file paths are requested, preventing direct access to files and generating a generic error message instead. The error script includes a generated incident ID for logging purposes.
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):**  A POC is included, showing how to exploit the vulnerability and also includes an example of accessing /etc/passwd which is a common test in LFI vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity.
*   The advisory specifically mentions that Deltek Maconomy Cloud customers have the patches in place, suggesting that cloud deployments were addressed promptly.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-12314 is a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in Deltek Maconomy products. It allows attackers to craft malicious URLs to access server-side files, potentially exposing sensitive information. The vulnerability is caused by inadequate path validation and can be mitigated by implementing a custom error script. This information provides more details than what might be included in a standard CVE description.
