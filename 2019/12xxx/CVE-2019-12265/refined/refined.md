Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-12265:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is present in the IGMPv3 client component of the Wind River VxWorks TCP/IP stack (IPnet). Specifically, it is described as a memory leak.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted IGMPv3 packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: The IGMPv3 client component does not properly manage memory, potentially leading to a memory leak upon receiving specially crafted packets.
- Business Logic Errors: The vulnerability is also classified as CWE-840: Business Logic Errors in some of the provided documents, suggesting a flaw in the logic of how IGMPv3 packets are processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leak: An attacker can potentially obtain a limited amount of data from the device due to the memory leak.
- Availability: Although not explicitly stated as the primary impact, a memory leak could potentially affect the availability of the device over time due to resource exhaustion.
- Integrity: The vulnerability description also states that an attacker "may be able to affect availability and integrity" indicating a potential to modify device behavior in some scenarios. This is likely due to the underlying memory corruption which could be leveraged to achieve these impacts, although not specifically stated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted IGMPv3 packets over a network.
- No authentication: The attack does not require any authentication.
- No user interaction: The attack requires no user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the target device.
- Ability to craft and send IGMPv3 packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities known as "URGENT/11" that affected the Wind River VxWorks TCP/IP stack.
- Multiple vendors, including Siemens and NetApp, were affected by this vulnerability in their products that incorporated VxWorks.
- Wind River has released patches for the affected versions of VxWorks, and vendors have released updates for their respective products to address this.
- The vulnerability is described as "medium" severity, and no public exploitation was known at the time of the advisories.
- The vulnerability is present in VxWorks versions 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9.3 and 6.9.4. It is marked as fixed in VxWorks 7 SR0540 and SR0620.

This vulnerability allows an attacker with network access to leak a limited amount of data from a device through crafting specific IGMPv3 packets, without requiring authentication or user interaction. The root cause is a memory leak and/or improper logic within the IPnet implementation in older versions of VxWorks.
