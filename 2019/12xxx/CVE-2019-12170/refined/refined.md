{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of filenames within uploaded ZIP archives during the backup restore process. Specifically, the application doesn't prevent directory traversal through filenames containing \"..\" sequences.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Upload",
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote command execution. An attacker can upload a malicious ZIP archive containing a PHP file to an arbitrary location within the server's filesystem. When accessed, this PHP file can execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the instructor backup function. An attacker can upload a specially crafted zip file through the backup upload functionality.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have instructor level privileges to access the backup upload functionality within the ATutor application."
