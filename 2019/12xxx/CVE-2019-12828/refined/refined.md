  "CVE-2019-12828": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Electronic Arts Origin. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious web page.",
    "root_cause": "The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. The Qt5 framework, used by Origin, allows the specification of plugin paths via the command line argument 'platformpluginpath'. By crafting a malicious URI, an attacker can pass this argument to the application and force it to load a malicious DLL from a remote UNC share.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of command-line arguments",
        "Unsanitized custom URI handlers",
        "Loading of plugins from untrusted remote locations"
      ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution in the context of the current user with medium integrity.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URI that, when clicked by a user (on a website, for example), triggers the vulnerable application (e.g., Origin) to load a malicious DLL from a remote location. Specifically, a crafted web page with an iframe using a custom URI handler can achieve this. The vulnerability requires user interaction, specifically that the user visit the malicious web page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious DLL on a remote UNC share and craft a malicious URI with the 'platformpluginpath' parameter pointing to that share. They also need to convince a user to click the crafted URI through a web page or other means.",
    "more_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when Qt5 based applications that create a custom URI handler don't properly sanitize their command-line arguments. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to use the 'platformpluginpath' command line argument to force the application to load a malicious DLL from a remote UNC share, leading to remote code execution. The malicious DLL must have a `.qtmetad` section. This was demonstrated with vulnerabilities in Malwarebytes (CVE-2019-6739) and Cisco WebEx (CVE-2019-1636) that share this underlying issue."
