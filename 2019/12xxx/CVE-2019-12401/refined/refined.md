    "summary": "The provided documents discuss CVE-2019-12401, an XML resource consumption vulnerability in Apache Solr versions prior to 5.0, which could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). NetApp products incorporating these vulnerable versions are also susceptible. The vulnerability stems from the ability of an attacker to create an XML document using DOCTYPE and ENTITY elements that will cause excessive memory consumption when parsed by the server, leading to OOMs. This is an unauthenticated, remotely exploitable vulnerability.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way Apache Solr versions prior to 5.0 handle XML parsing. Specifically, the use of XML DOCTYPE and ENTITY elements allows an attacker to craft a malicious XML document that, when parsed, expands to an extremely large size, consuming excessive resources.",
      "vulnerabilities": "XML resource consumption vulnerability, also known as a \"Lol Bomb\".",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption (OOMs) on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML document to the update handler of affected Apache Solr versions.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker does not need any special capabilities other than the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Apache Solr server.",
       "additional_info": "The provided GitHub content includes a proof of concept detailing a POST request containing a malicious XML payload. This payload uses XML DOCTYPE and ENTITY type elements to create a recursive pattern, which will lead to OOMs upon parsing by the server.  The NetApp advisory indicates that no NetApp products are affected because they do not incorporate the vulnerable versions of Apache Solr."
