Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-12537:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization/validation within the Zoho ManageEngine AssetExplorer application when handling search queries. Specifically, the `searchText` parameter in the HTTP POST request to `/SearchN.do` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `searchText` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code. This is a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they interact with the vulnerable search functionality.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Phishing:**  The attacker could redirect the user to a malicious website or display a fake login form to steal credentials.
*   **Defacement:** An attacker could potentially alter the appearance of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/SearchN.do` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Payload:** The attack payload is embedded within the `searchText` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to reach the vulnerable AssetExplorer instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/SearchN.do`) and parameter (`searchText`).
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker must be able to craft an HTTP POST request with the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided payload is `selectName=Purchase&searchText=%27%3E%3Csvg+onload%3Dalert%28%27xss%27%29%3E&submitbutton=%C2%A0`. This payload uses a SVG tag with an onload event to trigger JavaScript execution.
    *   `%27` is the URL encoded representation of a single quote (')
    *   `%3E` is the URL encoded representation of a greater-than sign (>)
    *   `%C2%A0` is the URL encoded representation of a non-breaking space.

The vulnerability is located in the `/SearchN.do` endpoint of the Zoho ManageEngine AssetExplorer 6.5 application.
