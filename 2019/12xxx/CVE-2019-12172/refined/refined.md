The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12172.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in Typora when handling HTML attributes, specifically within the `href` attribute of `<area>` tags. The application fails to sanitize the `file:\\` URI scheme, which allows execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The main weakness is the improper handling of the `file:\\` URI scheme, which allows the execution of local applications. This is a type of remote code execution vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `href` attribute of the `<area>` tag within a map.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. An attacker can use this to execute commands or programs, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or malware installation. The provided proof of concepts demonstrate the ability to launch the Calculator application on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted markdown files containing malicious HTML with a `file:\\` URI in the `href` attribute of an `<area>` tag. When the victim opens the markdown file in Typora and clicks on a specific area of an image that is mapped with `<area>`, it triggers the malicious URI leading to code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to create a specially crafted markdown file containing the malicious HTML and then trick the victim into opening the file using the vulnerable version of Typora. The attacker doesn't need to be in any special network position or have other elevated privileges. They simply need to deliver the malicious file.
