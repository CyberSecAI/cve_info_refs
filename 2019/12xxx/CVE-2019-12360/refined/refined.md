Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack-based buffer over-read exists in the `FoFiTrueType::dumpString` function within the `fofi/FoFiTrueType.cc` file of Xpdf. This function is responsible for processing TrueType font data embedded in PDF documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Over-read:** The vulnerability arises due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the TrueType font data, leading to a read beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer over-read can cause the application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Memory Leak:** The over-read can leak memory contents into the output, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted PDF Document:** The primary attack vector involves a maliciously crafted PDF document containing specially crafted TrueType font data.
*   **pdftops Tool:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `pdftops` tool, which is part of Xpdf, processes the crafted PDF document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted PDF document.
*   The attacker needs to have the crafted PDF processed by a vulnerable version of Xpdf using the `pdftops` tool.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by applying a fix from the Poppler project.
*   The fix involves generating and applying a patch based on the Poppler fix.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Fedora versions and also Debian 8 "Jessie"
