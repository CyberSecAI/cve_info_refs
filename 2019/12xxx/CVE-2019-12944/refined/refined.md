{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The smart lock's access control is not solely determined by the lock itself but relies on information stored in the smartphone app. This creates a vulnerability where, if the network connection of the smartphone is disabled, outdated access information is used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "State consistency issues: The lock does not maintain an up-to-date access list, leading to outdated permissions being used when offline.",
      "Lack of immediate revocation: Revoked permissions are not immediately enforced if the guest user is offline.",
        "Logging bypass: Actions performed offline are not logged or reported to the lock owner.",
	  "Poor password policy: In some locks, password policies do not enforce sufficient length or complexity, making them vulnerable to brute-force attacks"
    ],
    "impact": "A guest user can bypass access restrictions and continue to control the lock even after their access has been revoked or time limited, and without the activity being logged. Remote attackers can gain unauthorized access to the accounts through brute force attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Disabling network: Disabling the network of a guest user's smartphone while having Bluetooth connection.",
      "Brute-force attacks:  Targeting user credentials through repeated password attempts.",
	   "Man-in-the-middle attacks: Attempting to manipulate communication between the app and the server, though this attack is not successful in this report due to the lock verifying access through a hub."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Guest access: The attacker must have previously had authorized guest access to the lock.",
        "Network attacker: The attacker can attempt to spoof API requests and compromise the user's credentials.",
      "Proximity: In order to successfully perform offline attacks the attacker must be in Bluetooth range of the lock."
