Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-12989:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in the `cgi-bin/sdwanrestapi/getpackagefile.cgi` Perl script. User-supplied input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This occurs because the application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in a SQL query.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication by crafting a specific HTTP request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Creation/Writing:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write to and create files in locations accessible by the `mysql` user.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By writing a specific token file to the `/tmp` directory, an attacker can completely bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Remote Command Execution (Chained with CVE-2019-12991):** Combined with CVE-2019-12991, an attacker can achieve remote command execution with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/sdwan/nitro/v1/config/get_package_file` endpoint.
- **Specific HTTP Headers & Parameters:** The request needs to have the `SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY` header set to `SUCCESS`, the `action` parameter set to `file_download`, and a JSON payload containing the SQL injection in the `site_name` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Citrix SD-WAN appliance.
- **No Authentication Required (for CVE-2019-12989):** The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft specific HTTP POST requests with the required headers, parameters, and malicious SQL payloads.
