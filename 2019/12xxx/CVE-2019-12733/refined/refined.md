Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The SiteVision application does not properly validate if a user is authorized to add or edit modules of the "script" type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application lacks proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can add or modify "script" modules.
- **Code Injection:** The ability to add or edit script modules allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code, which can then be executed within the server environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server as root.
- **Arbitrary System Command Execution:** Attackers can use the injected script to execute system commands on the server.
- **File System Access:** Attackers can read files from the server file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates an HTTP request to change the module type from a harmless type (e.g., "text") to a "script" type.
- **Script Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the "script" module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker needs access to a low-privilege user account, such as an Editor ("Redakt√∂r") account.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the SiteVision application server.
- **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker needs to know how to manipulate the API requests for adding/editing modules.
