The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12732.

Vulnerability Details:
- Vulnerability: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Affected Software: Chartkick Ruby gem versions 3.1.0 and below
- Fixed Version: 3.2.0
- Root Cause: The Chartkick gem is vulnerable to XSS when used with `ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json = false` (which is not the default for Rails) OR when used with a non-Rails framework like Sinatra, AND untrusted data or options are passed to a chart.
- Attack Vector: Passing untrusted data or options to a chart. Examples include using data from `params` or directly from a database without proper sanitization.
- Impact: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- Required Conditions:
  - `ActiveSupport.escape_html_entities_in_json = false` OR using a non-Rails framework like Sinatra.
  - Untrusted data or options are passed to a chart.
- Weakness: CWE-79

Example Attack Vectors:
1. `<%= line_chart params[:data], min: params[:min] %>`
2. `<%= column_chart Visit.group(:user_agent).count %>`
