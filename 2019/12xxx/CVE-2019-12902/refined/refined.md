Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-12902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly handle user data upon deletion. Specifically, when a user is deleted, their associated data is not fully removed or marked as inaccessible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Data leakage: The system allows for the potential restoration of a deleted user's data by creating a new user with the same user ID.
- Inadequate user data deletion: The deletion process does not effectively remove or isolate the deleted user's data.
- User ID reuse: The system allows reuse of a deleted user's ID, which, when combined with the flawed data deletion process, results in the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized data access: An attacker can potentially gain access to a previous user's files and information, thereby breaching confidentiality and potentially other security principles like integrity depending on the data accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User creation: An attacker would need to create a new user account with the same User ID as a previously deleted user.
-  User ID reuse

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create user accounts.
- The attacker would need to know the User ID of a previously deleted account, but it's not explicitly stated if the User ID is publicly available or easily guessable. It does not appear to be the username or email.
