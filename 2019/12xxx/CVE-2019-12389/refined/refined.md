Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-12389

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Anviz devices store sensitive user information, including cleartext passwords/PINs, RFID tag data, and names, accessible via a proprietary network protocol without any authentication. This lack of access control is a core flaw.  This vulnerability is due to the lack of proper implementation of access control mechanisms which allows an attacker to query devices and access all stored data without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The device's proprietary protocol does not require a password or any form of authentication to access sensitive data.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The communication protocol is unencrypted, allowing easy inspection and manipulation of data packets.
*   **Replay Attack Vulnerability:** Due to the absence of NONCE or any other similar measure, captured valid network packets can be replayed by an attacker to execute actions on the device.
*   **Insecure Data Storage:** The device stores sensitive data, such as user passwords and PINs, in cleartext, making them easily retrievable if the device is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive user data, including passwords, PINs, RFID tag information, and names. This information could be used for unauthorized access to facilities or identity theft.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can open doors controlled by the device, bypassing the intended security measures using replay attacks.
*   **System Compromise:** The device can be completely controlled due to the lack of authentication requirements.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker can capture network traffic between the device and the management console to obtain valid commands for replay attacks.
*   **Direct Protocol Manipulation:** An attacker can directly communicate with the device using the unauthenticated protocol to retrieve sensitive information.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** An attacker intercept network traffic, modifies packets and sends them.
*   **Network scanning:** Attackers can perform port scans to find devices on the network and can directly connect and get data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the device, either through a local network or by exploiting port forwarding configurations if the device is exposed to the internet.
*   **Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the device's proprietary protocol to craft and send commands. However, this can be obtained using freely available resources such as an SDK that was found.
*   **No Authentication Needed**: An attacker doesn't need any sort of password or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve user data, bypass authentication, and send commands to the device, all without needing a password.
*   The content provides significantly more detail than a standard CVE description would, including details about the protocol, packet structures, and the root cause of the vulnerability.
