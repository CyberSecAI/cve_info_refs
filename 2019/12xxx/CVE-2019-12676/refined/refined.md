Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12676:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of certain options within OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA) type 11 packets by Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation of OSPF LSA type 11 packets.
- Failure to handle crafted or malformed options within the LSA type 11 packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a reload of the affected device, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- This DoS condition disrupts client traffic traversing the device, impacting network availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker sends a crafted LSA type 11 OSPF packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be adjacent to the targeted device, meaning they must be on the same network segment or have routing access to it.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication to send the malicious packets.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft OSPF LSA type 11 packets with malformed options.

**Additional Details:**
- There are no workarounds that mitigate the vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco products running vulnerable versions of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software that support OSPF routing.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- Cisco FMC Software is not affected.
