Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-12373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The LANDesk provisioning subsystem creates copies of injected files, including `unattend.xml`, in a globally readable network share (`\\<coreserver>\ldlogon\provisioning\config`).
*   This share has default permissions that allow "Everyone" to read from it, exposing sensitive data.
*   If an imaging task fails, these file copies are not removed, persisting in the share.
*  The `unattend.xml` file contains a base64 encoded string that contains the administrator account password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **(CWE-284) Improper Access Control:** The directory where sensitive files are stored is accessible to everyone on the network.
*   **(CWE-213) Intentional Information Disclosure:** The web service at `https://<coreserver>/ldlogon/provisioning/config` allows access to the same directory, making information disclosure intentional.
*   Exposure of sensitive information stored in `unattend.xml` (administrator password in base64).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with a domain user account (or access to a federated domain) can read the contents of the `unattend.xml` file.
*   By decoding the base64 string within the `unattend.xml` file, the attacker can obtain the administrator account password.
*   This could allow an attacker to gain full administrative control of the LDMS server and potentially take over managed endpoints.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Share Access:** The attacker can directly access the `\\<coreserver>\ldlogon\provisioning\config` share if they are on the same network, since "Everyone" has read access.
*   **Web Service Access:** The attacker can access the directory via the web service at `https://<coreserver>/ldlogon/provisioning/config`, given that the web service is intentionally configured for this access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a domain user account, or access to an account within a federated domain.
*   The attacker must be on the same network as the LDMS server or have access to the server via the web service.
*   Basic understanding of base64 encoding to decode the password.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects LANDesk Management Server 10.0.1.168 Service Update 5, which is no longer supported and will not receive a patch.
*   The issue is caused by the combination of insecure default permissions on the network share and the retention of files after failed imaging tasks.
* The web service, which provides necessary functionality for provisioning, also makes the vulnerability accessible through a web interface.
