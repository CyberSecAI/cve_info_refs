For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:  This advisory is part of the September 25, 2019, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 13 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2019 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72547).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable IOS XE Software release with the HTTP Server feature enabled.  The default state of the HTTP Server feature is version dependent.      For information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determining the HTTP Server Configuration**      To determine whether the HTTP Server feature is enabled for a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show running-config | include ip http server|secure-server** command in the CLI to check for the presence of the **ip http server** command or the **ip http secure-server** command in the global configuration. If either command is present and configured, the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the device.      The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include ip http server|secure-server** command for a device that has the HTTP Server feature enabled:        ```   Router# show running-config | include ip http server|secure-serverip http serverip http secure-server    ```    The presence of either command in the device configuration indicates that the HTTP Server feature is enabled.  If the output from the previous command also contains:    ```   ip http active-session-modules noneip http secure-active-session-modules none   ```    The device is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based user interface (Web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on an affected device.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  **Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Low Privileged Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (Web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated but low-privileged attacker to execute Cisco IOS commands with elevated privileges (level 15) on an affected device.  The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the Web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary Cisco IOS commands as a privilege level 15 user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-12651  **Cisco IOS XE Software WebUI Privileged Command Injection Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (Web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with *root* privileges.  The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator-level access (level 15) to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the Web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the device with *root* privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-12650  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Disabling the HTTP Server feature eliminates the attack vector for these vulnerabilities and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Administrators can disable the HTTP Server feature by using the **no ip http server** or **no ip http secure-server** command in global configuration mode. If both *http server* and *http-secure server* are in use, then both commands are required to disable the HTTP Server feature.  Limiting access to the HTTP Server to trusted networks will limit exposure to these vulnerabilities. The following example shows how to allow remote access to the HTTP Server from the trusted 192.168.0.0/24 network:    ```   !ip http access-class 75ip http secure-server!access-list 75 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255access-list 75 deny   any!   ```    **Note**: In newer versions of IOS XE Software, to apply the access list use the **ip http access-class ipv4 75** command for the previous example. [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html) provides additional information about how to harden the device and secure management access.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**-in the following field:       By default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the **Impact Rating** drop-down list.     For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.6 |
