Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12550:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2019-12550 and describes it as "Use of Hard-coded Credentials" in WAGO industrial managed switches. This aligns with the official description of the CVE which is related to hardcoded credentials.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of hard-coded usernames and passwords within the firmware of WAGO industrial managed switches (852-303, 852-1305, and 852-1505).

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Use of Hard-coded Credentials (CWE-798):** The devices have hardcoded user credentials that can be used to log in via SSH and Telnet.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of the hard-coded credentials allows an attacker to gain root access to the operating system of the managed switch. This enables the attacker to:
    - Manipulate the operating system.
    - Potentially disrupt communication.
    - Compromise the managed switch.

**5. Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, using either SSH or Telnet protocols.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WAGO industrial managed switches.
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory indicates that this vulnerability is easy to exploit, requiring only low skill level to exploit.
- **No Prior Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need valid user credentials to exploit this flaw.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory also mentions that the affected switches use outdated third-party components with known vulnerabilities, referencing CERT@VDE advisory number VDE-2019-013, which also contains details for CVE-2019-12550.
- The content provides specific firmware versions that are vulnerable and the fixed versions.
- The advisory provides mitigation recommendations which includes:
    - Updating the switch firmware.
    - Restricting network access to the switch and its SSH server.
    - Isolating the switch from direct Internet connection.
    - Implementing access control lists.
    - Isolating control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls.
    - Using VPNs for remote access.
- The content also provides the CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 and the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
