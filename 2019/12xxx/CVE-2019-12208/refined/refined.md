Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `njs_function_native_call` function within `njs/njs_function.c` at line 623.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: A write operation attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer's boundary on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The heap-buffer-overflow could potentially lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution by overwriting memory that stores function pointers or other critical data.
    - Denial of service through crashing the application or server.
    - Data corruption within the process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted JavaScript code snippet that involves an infinite loop calling `includes` on an array with specific arguments:
```javascript
var v0=Array()
while(v0.includes(v0.u,(Object()+((Boolean))),(Boolean),((({}>(Boolean)))),(0),v0.toString(([URIError]+Object))){}
```
- The vulnerability is triggered through the execution of this JavaScript code within the NJS engine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to provide the malicious JavaScript code to be processed by the vulnerable NJS engine.
- This could involve:
    - Attacking a service that uses NJS to process user-supplied JavaScript.
    - Compromising a system that uses NJS and inject the malicious script.
    - Triggering the vulnerability via a web application using NJS.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was found by the fuzzing tool called "fluff" from Samsung.
- The provided ASAN log clearly points to the `njs_function_native_call` function as the source of the overflow.
