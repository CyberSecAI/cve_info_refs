- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper signature verification during the installation of an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software fails to properly verify the signature of a virtual service image before loading it, leading to a signature bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can load a malicious, unsigned OVA image. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform code execution on a crafted software OVA image.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated, local attacker with valid administrator or privilege level 15 credentials can load a virtual service image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access with administrative privileges or privilege level 15 on the affected device.
