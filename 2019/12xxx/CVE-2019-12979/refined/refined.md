  "CVE-2019-12979": {
    "description": "ImageMagick 7.0.8-34 has a \"use of uninitialized value\" vulnerability in the SyncImageSettings function in MagickCore/image.c. This is related to AcquireImage in magick/image.c.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of uninitialized values within the `SyncImageSettings` function in `MagickCore/image.c`. Specifically, the `geometry_info.rho` and `geometry_info.sigma` members are used without ensuring they have been initialized when parsing the density from `image_info`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of uninitialized value"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation could lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially causing a denial of service, memory corruption, or other undefined behavior.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path during image processing."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to provide a malformed image file that contains a crafted density setting to trigger the vulnerable code path. No specific privileges are required."
