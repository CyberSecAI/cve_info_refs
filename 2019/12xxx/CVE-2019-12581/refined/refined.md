**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The `err_msg` parameter in the URL `http://GATEWAY/free_time_failed.cgi` is not sanitized, allowing the injection of HTML or JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL. This could lead to:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Defacing the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript or HTML code in the `err_msg` parameter. The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit this crafted URL, e.g., via phishing or a link on a compromised website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker must convince a victim to visit the crafted URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was previously discovered and fixed in ZyWall/USG devices but not in UAG devices, even though the devices share the same codebase for the "Free Time" feature.
- Affected devices include UAG2100, UAG4100, and UAG5100.
- The vulnerability exists in firmware version 4.18(AAIZ.1)C0 and earlier for UAG2100, 4.18(AATD.1)C0 and earlier for UAG4100, and 4.18(AAPN.1)C0 and earlier for UAG5100.
