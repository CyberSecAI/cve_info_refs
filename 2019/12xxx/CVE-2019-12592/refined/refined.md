Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was located in the Evernote Web Clipper extension for Google Chrome. It stemmed from a flaw that allowed attackers to bypass the browser's "same origin policy."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Bypass of the same-origin policy: The core issue was the ability to circumvent the same-origin policy, which is a security mechanism to prevent malicious scripts from one website from accessing data on another website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Successful exploitation would have enabled attackers to gain privileges outside of Evernote's domain within the Chrome browser.
-  Access to sensitive user data: This could have allowed access to information like usernames, passwords, financial data, social media conversations, and emails.
- Cross-site information access: Attackers could potentially access content and services from other websites that the user was logged into or using.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious script: The vulnerability would be exploited by injecting or executing malicious scripts that could bypass the same-origin policy.
- Chrome extension: The attack vector was specifically through the Evernote Web Clipper extension for Google Chrome.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious scripts: Attackers would need to have the capability to create or inject a malicious script that could bypass the same-origin policy within the context of the vulnerable Chrome extension.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability: The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability within the Evernote Web Clipper extension.
- User interaction is likely required: The user would likely have to have the extension installed and active, meaning the attacker is not in the network, but rather relying on an installed vulnerable extension.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Guardio through static code analysis.
- The issue was reported to Evernote, who deployed a fix within days, with no evidence of actual exploitation.
