The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Anviz biometric devices, and CVE-2019-12392 is mentioned in the title. However, the main text does not elaborate on CVE-2019-12392 specifically. Instead, it mentions that the password is not required for any operation and the protocol is vulnerable, which is likely related to the general family of issues with Anviz devices.

Based on the context, here's what can be extracted regarding CVE-2019-12392:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Anviz devices' communication protocol does not require authentication. The password is not validated or required for device access or management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication: The device does not verify passwords, allowing access and control without proper credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to all device information: An attacker can retrieve all stored data such as cleartext passwords/PINs, RFID tags, names, and other personal parameters.
- Full control of the device: An attacker can perform any action, including opening doors, adding/removing users, and changing device settings.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker needs to be on the same network (or have routed network access) as the Anviz device.
- Direct connection via TCP/5010

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network packets to the device via TCP/5010
- Knowledge of the Anviz communication protocol or access to the SDK.

**Additional Notes:**
- The lack of authentication is exacerbated by the fact that Anviz documentation recommends exposing devices directly to the internet through port forwarding for intersite connectivity.
- The described vulnerability enables the retrieval of sensitive personal data.
- There is no prior handshake required, enabling an attacker to bypass any expected authentication mechanism.
