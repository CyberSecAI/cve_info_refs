The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12047.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The post content editing area does not filter or prevent the execution of JavaScript, allowing for XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization in the post content editing area.
- Ability to call Node.js modules from the client-side.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution (RCE) on the user's machine running the application.
- The attacker can execute OS commands using `child_process.exec()`.
- Complete control of the local machine running the vulnerable application (demonstrated by the provided GIF showing control of a local Windows 10 machine).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a post's content using an `<img>` tag.
- The `onerror` event handler of the image tag is used to execute the malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit posts in the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or network access are needed for the initial attack, once an infected post is loaded, the attacker can perform further actions through the RCE.
- The attacker crafts the payload and adds it into a post/content, which when viewed, will trigger the vulnerability.
