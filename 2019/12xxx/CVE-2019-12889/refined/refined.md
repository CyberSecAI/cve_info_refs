{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control and input validation when the SailPoint Desktop Password Reset application launches a web browser to perform password reset operations. Specifically, it exposes a way to execute local system commands with elevated privileges.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Unauthenticated privilege escalation",
    "Inadequate access control",
    "Insufficient input validation",
     "Exposure of a web browser with access to local file system",
     "Failure to restrict execution of privileged commands",
    "Lack of network restrictions",
     "Misconfiguration of the password reset function"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain NT AUTHORITY\\System level privileges on the target machine, allowing them to perform any action with system-level access. This includes, but is not limited to, installing malware, accessing sensitive information, creating new accounts, and completely taking control of the machine.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Local access to the Windows logon screen",
    "Exploitation of the password reset function to launch a browser",
    "Manipulation of the exposed browser to access local file system",
    "Execution of privileged commands using the browser's access to the local file system"
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Local access to the target machine",
    "Ability to disconnect the computer from the local network / WAN",
    "Ability to connect the computer to an internet-facing access point / network",
     "Knowledge of the steps to trigger the password reset process and navigate the exposed browser"
    ]
