{
  "CVE-2019-12083": {
    "description": "The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x before 1.34.2 contains a stabilized method which, if overridden, can violate Rust's safety guarantees and cause memory unsafety. If the `Error::type_id` method is overridden then any type can be safely cast to any other type, causing memory safety vulnerabilities in safe code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or read). Code that does not manually implement Error::type_id is unaffected.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `Error::type_id` method, when overridden, can return an incorrect `TypeId` for the underlying error type. This allows for unsafe casting of types using the `Error::downcast` family of functions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper type casting",
        "Violation of memory safety guarantees"
      ],
      "impact": "Memory unsafety vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds read/write, and other potential issues due to incorrect type casting.",
      "attack_vector": "Exploitation occurs when a crate overrides the `Error::type_id` method and returns a `TypeId` of an unintended type.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide or influence the code that overrides `Error::type_id` in such a way that it returns the wrong TypeId."
    },
        "affected_versions": [
      "Rust 1.34.0",
      "Rust 1.34.1"
    ],
    "mitigations": [
      "Remove manual implementations of `Error::type_id`, allowing the default implementation to be used.",
      "Destabilization of the `Error::type_id` function."
    ],
    "patch_information": {
        "1.34.2": "A 1.34.2 point release was made to address this issue by destabilizing the `Error::type_id` function.",
        "1.35.0": "The upcoming 1.35.0 release will also be updated with the destabilization."
