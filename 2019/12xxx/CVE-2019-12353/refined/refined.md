Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerabilities found in zzcms 2019:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation and lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter and `COOKIE['dlid']` in multiple PHP files. Specifically, the code does not properly escape or quote the `id` parameter before including it in SQL queries. The application logic relies on checking for the presence of a comma (`,`) in the `id` parameter, but this check is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (`id` parameter and `COOKIE['dlid']`) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The `id` parameter is vulnerable in the following files:
        *   `/user/dls_print.php`
        *   `/user/dls_download.php`
        *   `/admin/deluser.php`
        *   `/admin/dl_sendmail.php`
        *   `/admin/showbad.php`
        *   `/admin/ztliuyan_sendmail.php`
    *   The `COOKIE['dlid']` parameter is vulnerable in the following files:
        *   `/dl/dl_sendmail.php`
        *   `/dl/dl_sendsms.php`
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data.
    *   Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining administrative access.
    *   Denial of service: Causing the application to crash or become unavailable.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. For the vulnerabilities in `/dl/dl_sendmail.php` and `/dl/dl_sendsms.php`, the attacker needs to be able to set cookies.
*   **Technical Details:**

    *   The code checks for the existence of a comma in the `id` parameter or `COOKIE['dlid']`. If a comma is found, the code proceeds to use the `id` parameter or `COOKIE['dlid']` directly in the SQL query without proper escaping.
    *   The vulnerability in `/dl/dl_sendmail.php` and `/dl/dl_sendsms.php` can be exploited by providing a non-zero value for the `n` parameter in the GET request, which prevents the `dlid` cookie from being set by the application, thus allowing the attacker to inject SQL code via the `COOKIE['dlid']` parameter.
*   **Payload Examples:** The report provides several Proof-of-Concept (POC) payloads for each vulnerable file, demonstrating how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities. These include:
    *   Union-based SQL injection: `id[]=1) union select ... -- a`
    *   Time-based SQL injection: `COOKIE['dlid'] = 1) union select sleep(3)-- a` or `id[0]=2342342) || IF((1=1),sleep(3),2)-- a`

CVE-2019-12353 is likely related to these SQL injection vulnerabilities in zzcms 2019.
