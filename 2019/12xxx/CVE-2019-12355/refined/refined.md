The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the zzcms project.

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input, specifically within the `id` parameter in various PHP files. The code directly concatenates the `id` parameter into SQL queries without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This vulnerability is present in multiple files:
    - `user/dls_print.php`
    - `user/dls_download.php`
    - `dl/dl_sendmail.php`
    - `dl/dl_sendsms.php`
    - `admin/deluser.php`
    - `admin/dl_sendmail.php`
    - `admin/showbad.php`
    - `admin/ztliuyan_sendmail.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might gain administrative access by injecting SQL queries that modify user roles.
- **Denial of Service:** By injecting time-based SQL injection queries (e.g. using `sleep()`), attackers can cause delays and disrupt the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP GET or POST requests, manipulating the `id` parameter.
- In `dl/dl_sendmail.php` and `dl/dl_sendsms.php`, the `dlid` parameter is taken from the `COOKIE` header, and the `n` parameter is taken from the GET request.
- The attacker needs to send a request to the vulnerable URLs with crafted payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or positions, as the vulnerability is exposed through public interfaces.
- Basic understanding of SQL is needed to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.
