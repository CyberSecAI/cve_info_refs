## ACTIVE-2019-007: ManageEngine Local Privilege Escalation

### Vulnerability Type:

Privilege Escalation

### Vendors:

Zoho Corporation Pvt. Ltd

### CVE ID:

CVE-2019-12133

### Affected Products:

* ManageEngine Desktop Central v10.0.380
* ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer v12.0.2
* ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus v10.0.0
* ManageEngine SupportCenter Plus v8.1
* ManageEngine O365 Manager Plus v4.0
* ManageEngine Mobile Device Manager Plus v9.0.0
* ManageEngine Patch Connect Plus v9.0.0
* ManageEngine Vulnerability Manager Plus v9.0.0
* ManageEngine Patch Manager Plus v9.0.0
* ManageEngine Browser Security Plus
* ManageEngine OpManager v12.3

* ManageEngine Network Configuration Manager v11.0
* ManageEngine FireWall v12.0
* ManageEngine Key Manager Plus v5.6
* ManageEngine Password Manager Pro v9.9
* ManageEngine Analytics Plus v1.0

### Summary:

Multiple ManageEngine products suffer from local privilege escalation due to improper permissions of `C:\ManageEngine` directory and its sub-folders which grant the `Users` group the `Create Files / write data` permission. Moreover, the services associated with said products will try to execute a number of nonexistent binaries such as `sc.exe` from the current directory upon system start. This will effectively allow non-privileged users to escalate privileges to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` by placing a payload as one of the nonexistent binaries in the problematic folder.

### Mitigation:

The reported vulnerability has been fixed in version 100393, please refer to vendor website for more information.

### Credit:

This vulnerability was found by Hashim Jawad of ACTIVELabs.
