SSA-352504: Urgent/11 TCP/IP Stack Vulnerabilities in Siemens
Power Meters

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2020-05-12
2020-06-09
V1.1

SUMMARY

Siemens low & high voltage power meters are affected by multiple security vulnerabilities due to the
underlying Wind River VxWorks network stack. This stack is affected by eleven vulnerabilities known as
the “URGENT/11”.

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute a variety of exploits for the purpose of Denial-of-
Service (DoS), data extraction, RCE, etc. targeting both availability and conﬁdentiality of the devices and
data.

Siemens is working on updates for the affected products, and recommends countermeasures until ﬁxes
are available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply appropriate strategies for mitigation on the network level to ensure affected devices are as

segmented.

• Apply Defense-in-Depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Siemens 9410 series power and engery meters help meet the needs of your energy monitoring and
cost management applications. These meters are ideally suited to local and remote monitoring of low or
high-voltage electrical installations in industrial facilities, commercial buildings, utility networks or critical
power environments.

The Siemens 9810 high accuracy and advanced power quality meter combines accurate; 3-phase energy
and power measurement with data logging, power quality analysis, e-mail, alarming, Modbus mastering,
Transient detection, Pre-Event/Post-Event Waveform capture and extensive I/O capablities in a highly
ﬂexible modular format.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

| [CVE-2025-24337](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24337) | WriteFreely through 0.15.1, when MySQL is used, allows local users to discover credentials by reading config.ini. | -- | Jan 20, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-24014](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24014) | Vim is an open source, command line text editor. A segmentation fault was found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn\'t show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn\'t been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043. | -- | Jan 21, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-24013](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24013) | CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. Prior to 4.5.8, CodeIgniter lacked proper header validation for its name and value. The potential attacker can construct deliberately malformed headers with Header class. This could disrupt application functionality, potentially causing errors or generating invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests might lead to a DoS scenario if a remote service’s web application firewall interprets them as malicious and blocks further communication with the application. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.5.8. | -- | Jan 20, 2025 |
| [CVE-2025-24010](https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2025-24010) | Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. Vite allowed any websites to send any requests to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings and lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.0.9, 5.4.12, and 4.5.6. | -- | Jan 20, 2025 |
