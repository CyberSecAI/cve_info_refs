{
  "CVE-2019-12881": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The provided code and kernel logs indicate a null pointer dereference in the `__sg_alloc_table_from_pages` function. This occurs due to incorrect handling of user-provided pointers when allocating scatter-gather tables for DMA operations within the i915 graphics driver.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the improper validation or handling of the user-provided `buffers_ptr` within the `drm_i915_gem_execbuffer2` structure. Specifically, the exploit code performs pointer arithmetic to reference memory locations before the intended buffer, which results in a null pointer dereference when the kernel attempts to access this memory. This indicates a weakness in the kernel's input validation and memory management for user-supplied data within the `i915` driver.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation results in a kernel panic and a denial-of-service condition. The kernel crash can halt the system, disrupting normal operations.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local. The exploit is triggered through the `/dev/dri/card0` device using `ioctl` calls. The attacker needs to have access to the local system and the ability to use the i915 DRM driver.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to open and use the DRM device. They need the ability to execute code that can make ioctl calls to the DRM device, utilizing a crafted input structure to trigger the vulnerability."
    },
     {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate a vulnerable version of the Linux Kernel.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Linux kernel versions through 5.1.6 are susceptible to vulnerabilities that may lead to disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or Denial of Service.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vectors depend on the specific vulnerable component. The NetApp advisory indicates that this vulnerability has a high CVSS score (7.8) with an attack vector described as local (AV:L), low complexity, low privileges, and no user interaction, indicating that a local attacker could achieve full compromise of the vulnerable system.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs local access to the affected system."
