\*Nagios XI is available in multiple different license levels: 100 Node through Unlimited Node. A Node is anything with an IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) that you would like to monitor (switches, routers, firewalls, workstations, and other network devices). There are no restrictions on the number of Services you can monitor.

\*\*While paid licenses of Nagios XI do not contain any software-imposed limitations, we have found that systems performing more than 15,000-20,000 checks in a 5-minute interval should consider following our Server Considerations Guide to ensure the best performance on your installation.

## Nagios Success Stories

We’ve worked with thousands of incredible businesses of all sizes across the globe. Hear what they have to say.

[View Case Studies](https://www.nagios.com/case-studies/)

We are a telecommunications company and the leader in our region. Our monitoring goals were fulfilled with Nagios. We had all of our devices monitored 24/7 and were able to take advantage of all the reports and tools that Nagios has to offer.

![comteco](https://www.nagios.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/comteco.webp)

The biggest advantage of Nagios for us is its customizations. Nagios has simplified a very large job, allowed us to make the necessary customizations needed and provided us with a community that is a valuable resource when a new requirement comes up.

![IBM](https://www.nagios.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IBM_logo-1-1.svg)

Before monitoring, we couldn’t even spend the bulk of our time fighting fires; we were spending time finding them. Now, our system is nearly self-healing. Nagios is super easy to install and configure, runs on standard bash scripts, and allows us to automate anything.
