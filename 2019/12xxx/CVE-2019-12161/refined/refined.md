The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability on `wpt.stage.mozaws.net` that allowed an attacker to pull AWS metadata and keys.

*   **Vulnerability:** SSRF
*   **Root Cause:** The application failed to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied URLs, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions on accessing internal resources. Specifically, the application blocked access to the AWS metadata URL `169.254.169.254`, but it did not account for octal-encoded IP addresses.
*   **Attack Vector:** By submitting an octal-encoded IP address (e.g., `http://0251.00376.000251.0000376/latest/meta-data/public-keys/0/openssh-key`) in the "Enter a Website URL" form, an attacker could bypass the block and access the AWS metadata server.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of AWS metadata, including access keys and secrets. While the instance in question did not have an IAM instance profile attached, the exposed keys could potentially be used to access other AWS resources if they were associated with a different account or service. The reporter initially assessed the impact as SSRF to RCE.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needed to be an authenticated user with access to the `wpt.stage.mozaws.net` domain through Github SSO (limited to NDA contributors).
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed by implementing two measures:
    1.  Scanning all URLs requested by the browser during a test and deleting all data and failing the test if any URL path started with `/latest/meta-data`.
    2.  Null-routing the metadata IP address on the EC2 agents to make it completely inaccessible from the agents during the test.
