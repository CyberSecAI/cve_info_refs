Hi guys, It's been a while since I last updated the blog. Been busy. So, for today I will be giving guide on how to setup MobSF in Ubuntu 18.04 . There is a lot of guide out there about how to setup MobSF. I'm here to give out step by step guide to set it up as per my own experience. The main reason of using Ubuntu 18.04 is because it has a built-in Python 3.6 and pip3 version 9.0.1 which is the requirements to setup MobSF. It's pretty much simplify the process of setting up MobSF. \*Note that this is a guide to setup MobSF for static analysis. For dynamic analysis, you can refer to MobSF page in github. MobSF also known as Mobile Security Framework is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing framework capable of performing static analysis, dynamic analysis, malware analysis and web API testing. Can further read about MobSF here:  https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF For Ubuntu 18.04 can be downloaded ...

Hi peeps, It's been a while since my last post. Been busy. So, for today I would like to share on how to setup RMS (Runtime Security Mobile) in Ubuntu 18.04. RMS -  https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security "Runtime Mobile Security (RMS), powered by FRIDA, is a powerful web interface that helps you to manipulate Android and iOS Apps at Runtime." "You can easily dump all the loaded classes and relative methods, hook everything on the fly, trace methods args and return value, load custom scripts and many other useful stuff." This is a continuation of my post here  https://faudhzanrahman.blogspot.com/2019/09/setting-up-mobsf-in-ubuntu-1804.html  where I did a setup on MobSF.  I'm currently trying to set a box where it contains all sort of testing tools specifically for mobile . Now I have both MobSF and RMS setup in this box which is the Ubuntu 18.04. The same reason of setting RMS in this box is because the requirements fits Ubuntu 18.04. T...
