- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `replace` function in `parse_x86_pseudo.c` (and potentially other RParsePlugins) lacks a boundary check for the `newstr` variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based or stack-based buffer overflow in the `replace` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Heap-based buffer overflow can lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered through the `rasm2` utility, specifically when using the `:x86.pseudo` option. The call chain is `rasm2` -> `r_parse_parse` -> `replace`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide crafted input to the `rasm2` utility that will trigger the vulnerable `replace` function with an oversized `newstr`.
