{
  "CVE-2019-12513": {
    "relevancy": "YES",
    "Root cause": "The Netgear Nighthawk R9000 web application improperly handles DHCP requests when writing to the log, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content, leading to cross-site scripting.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Cross-site scripting vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the logs, which will be executed when an administrator views the logs. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious DHCP request is sent to the router, which will log the request, and the injected code would execute when the logs are viewed.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted DHCP request to the router. This can be done from the local network or remotely via DNS rebinding. No authentication is required."
