Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12518:

**Verification:**

The provided text directly mentions CVE-2019-12518 and links it to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the CrossChex management software. This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CrossChex management software when handling UDP packets during device discovery. The software does not properly validate the size of the incoming data, allowing a specially crafted packet to overwrite parts of the stack.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The software fails to properly check the size of the data in UDP discovery packets, leading to a buffer overflow.
    *   **Absence of Memory Protection:** The CrossChex application lacks ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention), making it easier to exploit the buffer overflow.

*  **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine running the CrossChex software.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Since the CrossChex software requires administrative privileges to run, an attacker can gain elevated privileges on the compromised system by exploiting this vulnerability.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted UDP packet to the machine running the vulnerable software on port 5060.
    *   **Local Network:** The attacker must be on the same network or be able to send UDP packets to the target machine.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target machine or be able to send UDP packets to it.
    *   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to have the technical ability to craft a malicious UDP packet and understand how to exploit buffer overflows.
    *   **Knowledge of the protocol:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the proprietary protocol to craft valid requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided text indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the machine running the CrossChex software.
*   The lack of ASLR and DEP makes exploitation significantly easier.
*   The attacker can gain elevated privileges on the system due to the administrative requirements of the CrossChex application.
*   A python tool was created to exploit this and other vulnerabilities, called anvizpwn.
