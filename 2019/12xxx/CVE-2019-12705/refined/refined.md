Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-12705

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.
- CWE-79: This is the associated Common Weakness Enumeration identifier, which specifically points to improper neutralization of input during web page generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: A successful exploit can enable the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected web interface.
- Sensitive information access: The attacker can potentially access sensitive browser-based information through the injected script.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to persuade a user of the affected system's web interface to click a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated remote attacker: The attacker does not need to have prior authentication to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- Ability to create a malicious link: The attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious script.
- Ability to socially engineer a user: The attacker needs to convince the user to click the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected products are Cisco Expressway Series and TelePresence VCS running software versions earlier than Release X12.5.4.
- No workarounds are available.
- Fixed software is available in releases X12.5.4 and later.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing by Colin Williams of Cisco.
- There is no evidence of public announcements or exploitation in the wild.
