Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a user logs out of Apache NiFi (using an authentication mechanism other than PKI), the server-side authentication token is not invalidated, even though the client-side token is.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Session Termination:** The logout process only invalidates the client-side token, leaving the server-side token active.
*   **Token Reuse:** The server-side token remains valid, allowing a user or an attacker who has obtained this token to make API requests even after the legitimate user has logged out.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with a valid bearer token obtained prior to logout could continue to make API requests to NiFi as the logged-out user. This could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data or modification of the NiFi flow.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information through unauthorized API access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Token Theft:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid bearer token before the user logs out. This could be achieved through network sniffing, malware on the user's system, or compromised user accounts.
*   **Replay Attack:** The attacker replays the stolen token to access the API after the legitimate user has logged out.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Prior Authentication:** The attacker must have gained access to the NiFi application and obtained a valid bearer token while a user was logged in.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the NiFi server.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attacker does not require any interaction with the legitimate user after the token is obtained; the vulnerability relies on the server-side token not being invalidated upon user logout.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to setups using authentication mechanisms other than PKI.
*   The server-side token remained valid for up to 12 hours after logout in vulnerable versions.
*   The fix involves invalidating the server-side token immediately after the user logs out.
*   This vulnerability was fixed in Apache NiFi version 1.10.0.
