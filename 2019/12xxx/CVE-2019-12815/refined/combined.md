An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for proftpd fixes the following issues:
\* GeoIP has been discontinued by Maxmind (boo#1156210) This update removes
module build for geoip see
<https://support.maxmind.com/geolite-legacy-discontinuation-notice/>
- CVE-2019-19269: Fixed a NULL pointer dereference may occur when
validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server
(boo#1157803)
- CVE-2019-19270: Fixed a Failure to check for the appropriate field of a
CRL entry prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account
(boo#1157798)
- CVE-2019-18217: Fixed remote unauthenticated denial-of-service due to
incorrect handling of overly long commands (boo#1154600 gh#846)
Update to 1.3.6b
\* Fixed pre-authentication remote denial-of-service issue (Issue #846).
\* Backported fix for building mod\_sql\_mysql using MySQL 8 (Issue #824).
Update to 1.3.6a:
\* Fixed symlink navigation (Bug#4332).
\* Fixed building of mod\_sftp using OpenSSL 1.1.x releases (Issue#674).
\* Fixed SITE COPY honoring of <Limit> restrictions (Bug#4372).
\* Fixed segfault on login when using mod\_sftp + mod\_sftp\_pam (Issue#656).
\* Fixed restarts when using mod\_facl as a static module
\* Add missing Requires(pre): group(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Add missing Requires(pre): user(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Use pam\_keyinit.so (boo#1144056)
- Reduce hard dependency on systemd to only that which is necessary for
building and installation.
update to 1.3.6:
\* Support for using Redis for caching, logging; see the
doc/howto/Redis.html documentation.
\* Fixed mod\_sql\_postgres SSL support (Issue #415).
\* Support building against LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL (Issue #361).
\* Better support on AIX for login restraictions (Bug #4285).
\* TimeoutLogin (and other timeouts) were not working properly for SFTP
connections (Bug#4299).
\* Handling of the SIGILL and SIGINT signals, by the daemon process, now
causes the child processes to be terminated as well (Issue #461).
\* RPM .spec file naming changed to conform to Fedora guidelines.
\* Fix for "AllowChrootSymlinks off" checking each component for symlinks
(CVE-2017-7418).
New Modules:
\* mod\_redis, mod\_tls\_redis, mod\_wrap2\_redis With Redis now supported as a
caching mechanism, similar to Memcache, there are now Redis-using
modules: mod\_redis (for configuring the Redis connection information),
mod\_tls\_redis (for caching SSL sessions and OCSP information using
Redis), and mod\_wrap2\_redis (for using ACLs stored in Redis).
Changed Modules:
\* mod\_ban: The mod\_ban module's BanCache directive can now use Redis-based
caching; see doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanCache.
-New Configuration Directives
\* SQLPasswordArgon2, SQLPasswordScrypt
The key lengths for Argon2 and Scrypt-based passwords are now
configurable via these new directives; previously, the key length had been
hardcoded to be 32 bytes, which is not interoperable with all other
implementations (Issue #454).
Changed Configuration Directives
\* AllowChrootSymlinks When "AllowChrootSymlinks off" was used, only the
last portion of the DefaultRoot path would be checked to see if it was a
symlink. Now, each component of the DefaultRoot path will be checked to
see if it is a symlink when "AllowChrootSymlinks off" is used.
\* Include The Include directive can now be used within a <Limit> section,
e.g.: <Limit LOGIN> Include /path/to/allowed.txt DenyAll </Limit> API
Changes
\* A new JSON API has been added, for use by third-party modules.

# ProFTPD: Remote code execution — GLSA **201908-16**

A vulnerability in ProFTPD could result in the arbitrary execution
of code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/proftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.6-r5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.6-r5** |

### Background

ProFTPD is an advanced and very configurable FTP server.

### Description

It was discovered that ProFTPD’s “mod\_copy” module does not
properly restrict privileges for anonymous users.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by anonymously uploading a malicious file, could
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process, cause
a Denial of Service condition or disclose information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.6-r5"

```

| [@computersalat](https://github.com/computersalat) Hopefully it does, but you may need to build from source from the 1.3.6 branch until a release happens. I don't think the fix has been backported to 1.3.5 yet. |

| If I installed 1.3.6 when it was released via RPM, would that version be vulnerable as well? From what I can read on NVD it's only up to 1.3.5b? |

| [@benlarsendk](https://github.com/benlarsendk) 1.3.6 is vulnerable as well. You will need to either build a new RPM from the 1.3.6 branch (you can refer to `contrib/dist/travis/docker-rpmbuild.sh` for how to do this) or wait for your package maintainer to do so. |

Today I built a Debian package using source code of 1.3.5e and noticed that the issue is still reproducible. At least I can still create a malicious.php as described in Bug 4372. Please double check. Thanks! Some additional information: There were other issues related to mod\_copy, but CVE-2019-12815 is specific to the issue reported in <http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4372> . The reporters (Tobias Mädel) blogpost about it is at <https://tbspace.de/cve201912815proftpd.html> . The CVE description should always be taken with a salt of grain. It might just reflect the information available at a given point in time or might reflect which versions were tested, but not mentioning further followup versions in a branch does not necessarly mean it was fixed after the mentioned version (unless it is clearly stated that the issue is fixed in version x.y). Sorry for the lengthly excurse, but I hope it is of benefit for all following this issue as there was some confusion on which are the fixed versions. At time of writing there is the fix commited but there is no upstream version which would contain already the fix. Hope this helps :) If the fix additionally to on top of the 1.3.6 series could be backported to the 1.3.5 series that would help downstreams shipping this version :) Actually for Debian stretch Hilmar Preusse did backport the changes, see <https://bugs.debian.org/932453> but in Debian we have not yet releases a so called DSA, because the version for 1.3.5 backport shows a strange behaviour. When trying to reproduce the issue, the connection just terminates (plugging effectively the issue, but for the 1.3.6 version it returns correctly a permission denied and connection remains intact). There might thus missed some prerequeisite commits for backports to the 1.3.5 series in e.g. the error handling or so. |

It wasn't a backport what I did. I simply adapted the patch we got in this pull request so it applies to the source tree and compilation runs OK. As said: I didn't even do functional testing. ;-( |

CP 1543-1

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2020-02-11
2020-02-11
V1.0

SUMMARY

The latest update for SIMATIC CP 1543-1 contains two ﬁxes for vulnerabilities within its embedded
ProFTPD FTP server. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution
and information disclosure without authentication.

Siemens has released updates for SIMATIC CP 1543-1 modules.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SIMATIC CP 1543-1 (incl. SIPLUS NET vari-
ants):
All Versions >= V2.0 and < V2.2

Update to V2.2
https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/
view/109775642

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable the embedded FTP server. The server is deactivated in the default conﬁguration.

• Limit access to port 21/tcp to trusted IP addresses.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SIMATIC CP 1543-1 communication processor connects the S7-1500 controller to Ethernet networks.
It provides integrated security functions such as ﬁrewall, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and support
of other protocols with data encryption such as FTPs. The communication processor protects S7-1500
stations against unauthorized access, as well as integrity and conﬁdentiality of transmitted data.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-12815

An arbitrary ﬁle copy vulnerability in mod_copy of the embedded FTP server allowes for remote code
execution and information disclosure without authentication, a related issue to CVE-2015-3306.

# CVE-2019-19270

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-19269.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-19271.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-19270 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19270)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in tls\_verify\_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.

| [Description](#c0)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-13 22:45:57 UTC  ``` Woodchip had problems booting a test -r16 CD on his laptop.  Here's a transcript of the problem (the CD included 2.4.17-r3):  1.  boot the CD - nothing eye catching here. - press enter for your PCI autodetect stuff    (doesnt actually find anything for my laptop, which is normal... nothing to find)  2.  mounted my /dev/hda2 to /mnt/linux -  this partition was made like a week ago, using a possibly old version of    mkreiserfs.  mkreiserfs -h tea /dev/hda2  3.  examined some files in the /mnt/linux/etc directory.  was obviously working      as I 'cat'ed some files.  4.  trying modprobe some_modules_for_my_pcmcia_stuff, gets a lot of unresolved      symbols.  5.  Around this time, started seeing errors on the console:    status error:  status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }    hda:  drive not ready for command    task_out_intr: should not trigger  Im sorry, I dont recall the actual ordering of the messages.  But the task_out_intr came in spurts of like 5 or 6 lines at a time.  (the same error)  6.  Rebooted the machine.  7.  Select linux in lilo menu, kernel actually boots!  but panics when it cant find    the / reiserfs partition.  Weird, this laptop has only a /, no seperate /boot partition.    So it obviously read the kernel off the disk, but died when coming to fstab??  8.  So its apparent at this stage, that the / partition is corrupted?  9.  Reboot with the CD again.  Once booted into the CD, tried mounting windows    partition just for the heck of it.  mount -t vfat /dev/hda3 /mnt/win ; immediately    umount /mnt/win (just to see what happens) and boom, get:    task_out_intr: should not trigger     So thats happening by just mounting, and immediately unmounting.  10.  Decide that this CD is dangerous :(  laptop:  toshiba 440cdx satellilte pro  (older machine, P133 w/MMX, 48MB RAM) hda: TOSHIBA MK1403MAV, ATA DISK drive ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-14 23:14:00 UTC  ``` This is a confirmed bug (confirmed with Andre, the patch author).  It will be fixed soon.  Until it is, we'll keep it out of our kernel.  2.4.17-r5 solves this problem; it'll be uploaded in less than an hr, so I'm marking this as fixed. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c0)  TJ Saunders    2019-07-17 16:24:00 UTC  ``` A ProFTPD user reported the following via email: the mod_copy module's custom SITE CPFR and SITE CPTO commands do not honor <Limit READ> and <Limit WRITE> configurations as expected.  To reproduce, just enable the anonymous user example that is configured in the Debian default proftpd.conf:  <Anonymous ~ftp>   User                ftp   Group                nogroup   UserAlias            anonymous ftp   RequireValidShell        off    MaxClients            10   DisplayLogin            welcome.msg   DisplayChdir        .message    # Limit WRITE everywhere in the anonymous chroot   <Directory *>     <Limit WRITE>       DenyAll     </Limit>   </Directory>  </Anonymous>  ftp proftptest.domain.org (on linux, using a regular ftp client) Login as anonymous here. You normally can't upload files, because of the DenyAll site cpfr welcome.msg site cpto malicious.php  You've now created a malicious.php file with the contents of welcome.msg. That can easily be used for RCE and similar things on many setups. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c1)  TJ Saunders    2019-07-17 16:27:24 UTC  ``` PR to address this issue:   <https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/pull/816> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c2)  TJ Saunders    2019-07-17 16:49:20 UTC  ``` PR merged to master, and backported to the 1.3.6 branch. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c3)  TJ Saunders    2019-07-27 21:15:12 UTC  ``` For future reference, this is assigned CVE-2019-12815. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c4)  Christian Wittmer    2019-07-31 16:21:20 UTC  ``` (Mit Bezug zu [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c2)) > PR merged to master, and backported to the 1.3.6 branch.  will there be a backport for 1.3.5 branch also ? will there be new 'security' Releases for 1.3.5 and 1.3.6 branches ?

Not really. It includes use of pr_cmd_set_errno(), which was introduced in 1.3.6. The PROFTPD_VERSION_NUMBER check in mod_copy (and probably several other modules) should probably be adjusted to reflect this.

Why ?  As I mentioned in [Comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c7), the pr_cmd_set_errno() function was introduced in proftpd 1.3.6 and therefore cannot be used in proftpd 1.3.5. Hence the error handling code in my patch is adjusted to be in the style used elsewhere in proftpd 1.3.5, without using that function. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=4372#c14)  TJ Saunders    2019-10-12 23:48:31 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.6a, 1.3.7rc1. ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-e9187610c3
2019-08-01 02:59:40.158023
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.3.6
Release : 21.fc30
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update addresses an arbitrary file copy vulnerability in mod\_copy in
ProFTPD, which allowed for remote code execution and information disclosure
without authentication due to not honoring `<Limit>` constraints. Upstream bug:
<http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4372>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Tue Jul 23 2019 Paul Howarth paul@city-fan.org - 1.3.6-21
- An arbitrary file copy vulnerability in mod\_copy in ProFTPD allowed for
remote code execution and information disclosure without authentication

# CVE-2017-7418

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2017-7407.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2017-7426.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2017-7418 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7418)

#### Description

ProFTPD before 1.3.5e and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc5 controls whether the home directory of a user could contain a symbolic link through the AllowChrootSymlinks configuration option, but checks only the last path component when enforcing AllowChrootSymlinks. Attackers with local access could bypass the AllowChrootSymlinks control by replacing a path component (other than the last one) with a symbolic link. The threat model includes an attacker who is not granted full filesystem access by a hosting provider, but can reconfigure the home directory of an FTP user.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
