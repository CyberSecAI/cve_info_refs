Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12815:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `mod_copy` module of ProFTPD, specifically in how the `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands are handled.
- The module doesn't properly enforce `<Limit>` restrictions, allowing unauthorized file copying.
- The `mod_copy` module performs insufficient privilege checks for anonymous users with `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate access control:**  The `mod_copy` module fails to properly restrict the `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands.
- **Arbitrary file copy:**  An attacker can copy any file on the server to another location, even without write permissions in the destination directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** Attackers can upload malicious scripts (e.g. PHP) by copying them from publicly accessible locations and then executing them.
- **Information disclosure:** Attackers can copy configuration and other sensitive files to a publicly accessible location.
- **Denial of service:** Though not emphasized, a large number of copy operations could potentially cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks using FTP protocol.
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable ProFTPD server.
- No prior authentication is required, as this can be exploited anonymously.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects ProFTPD versions up to and including 1.3.5b. Version 1.3.6 is also affected, but the fix is included in 1.3.6a and later.
- The fix involves ensuring the `mod_copy` module checks `<Limit>` configurations for `SITE CPFR` and `SITE CPTO` commands.
- Patches have been backported to 1.3.5 by some distributions.
- The fix also adds directory checks.
