Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12817:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem on certain 64-bit PowerPC architectures with the hash page table (HPT) MMU handles memory mappings above 512TB. Specifically, during process forking, the child process incorrectly inherits the context ID of the parent process for mappings above 512TB, leading to memory corruption and potential privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect context ID inheritance:**  Child processes inherit the parent's context ID for memory mappings above 512TB instead of getting a new one.
*   **Use-after-free:** When a child process exits, the inherited context ID used by the parent process is freed, which could be reallocated to other process. This can allow unrelated processes to read/write each other's virtual memory.
*   **Memory corruption:** The parent and child process can write to each other's memory above 512TB, even when they should be isolated.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The ability to read/write to other processes memory can be used to gain elevated privileges by a local unprivileged user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Processes can write to each other's virtual memory above 512TB.
*   **Information Exposure:** Processes can potentially access memory of other unrelated processes, leaking sensitive information.
*  **Privilege Escalation**: An unprivileged user could leverage this to gain elevated system privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** If a third process reallocates the context id, the parent process can read/write the third processes mappings below 512TB. This could result in double frees.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local:**  A local, unprivileged user needs to have the ability to run code on the affected system.
*   **`mmap()` with large memory allocation:** A process must allocate memory above 512TB using `mmap()`.
*   **`fork()`:** The process which has allocated memory above 512TB needs to call `fork()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to a system running a vulnerable Linux kernel on 64-bit PowerPC hardware with the hash page table MMU.
*   The attacker must be able to execute code to make system calls.
*   The attacker does not need special privileges to trigger the vulnerability initially.
*   The attacker needs to be able to map memory regions above 512TB which is not common in ordinary programs.
*   The attacker needs to fork a process to cause the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue affects systems using the hash page table (HPT) MMU, such as PowerPC 970 (G5), PA6T, Power5/6/7/8/9, and LPARs under PowerVM on Power9.
*   Power9 bare metal machines using Radix MMU are not affected, unless explicitly booted in HPT mode by using "disable\_radix" kernel command line.
*   KVM guests may also be affected if the host or guest is configured to use the HPT MMU.
*   Kernels built with PAGE\_SIZE=4K are not affected.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in commit `f384796c40dc`.
*   The fix is in commit `ca72d88378b2f2444d3ec145dd442d449d3fefbc`.
*   A selftest for the vulnerability was added in commit `16391bfc862342f285195013b73c1394fab28b97`.
*   The openSUSE security update `openSUSE-SU-2019:1757-1` addresses this issue (as well as other vulnerabilities).
*   Ubuntu's USN-4031-1 addresses this vulnerability for several versions of their OS.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux is affected and have published fixes via errata `RHSA-2019:2703` and `RHBA-2019:2767`
*   The Fedora update fixes this with Linux Kernel 5.1.15-200.fc29.
