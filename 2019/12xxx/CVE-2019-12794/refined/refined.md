The provided content relates to CVE-2019-12794.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that organization administrators in MISP have the ability to reset passwords for all users within their organization. This capability, while intended for legitimate user management, could be abused in specific scenarios. If a host organization creates organization administrators with lower privileges instead of site administrators, these organization administrators could potentially reset passwords for site administrators, effectively gaining control of the MISP instance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inherent privilege of organization admins to reset passwords for all organization users.
- Lack of restriction preventing lower-privileged org admins from resetting site admin passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who has gained access as an organization administrator could reset the password of a site administrator.
- Once the site administrator account is compromised, the attacker could gain full control of the MISP instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires the attacker to already possess organization administrator privileges.
- This attack is most effective when the host organization has created lower-privileged org admins instead of the usual site admins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have compromised an organization administrator account.
- The attacker needs to be in the same organization as the site administrator they are trying to target.
