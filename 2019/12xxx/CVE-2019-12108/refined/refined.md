Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from MiniUPnPd's improper handling of unpopulated user XML input. Specifically, the `GetValueFromNameValueList` function, when parsing XML data, can return NULL pointers if a tag is missing. This lack of handling for NULL values then leads to a crash when the code attempts to dereference them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code does not properly check for NULL pointers returned by `GetValueFromNameValueList` before using them in the `GetOutboundPinholeTimeout` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the `miniupnpd` service, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed XML Input:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending crafted XML data to the `miniupnpd` service that lacks certain expected XML tags or values.
- **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely by sending the malformed XML input through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the `miniupnpd` service.
- **Ability to send crafted XML:** The attacker needs to be able to send specific crafted XML requests to the service.
- No special privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**
The `GetOutboundPinholeTimeout` function in `miniupnpd/upnpsoap.c` retrieves values such as "RemotePort", "Protocol", and "InternalPort" from an XML input using the `GetValueFromNameValueList` function. If any of these values are not present in the XML, the `GetValueFromNameValueList` function will return NULL. The code then attempts to use these returned values without checking if they are NULL, which can cause a crash when dereferencing a NULL pointer.

The fix for this vulnerability in commit [13585f1](https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp/commit/13585f15c7f7dc28bbbba1661efb280d530d114c) adds a check for NULL values. However, this fix had an error which was corrected by the commit [86030db](https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp/commit/86030db849260dd8fb2ed975b9890aef1b62b692).
