Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12308:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `AdminURLFieldWidget` in Django displayed the provided URL value directly, without sanitizing or validating it as a safe URL. This allowed for the injection of malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Inadequate input validation in the `AdminURLFieldWidget`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code which would then execute in a user's browser when they viewed the admin page, potentially leading to various malicious actions such as:
    - Data theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of admin pages

**Attack vectors:**

- The malicious payload could be introduced through:
    - A direct value stored in the database field used by the widget
    - As a URL query parameter payload, when the form is loaded with URL parameters

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to introduce malicious URLs into the database or as part of the URL parameters.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated with administrative access to trigger the vulnerability, only to insert the malicious payload into the form field.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a logged-in admin user viewing the relevant page in the Django admin interface.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involved adding a validation step using `URLValidator` to sanitize the URL before displaying it as a clickable link.
- The `validator_class` kwarg allows for customization of this validator in specific cases.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Django (1.11.x, 2.1.x, and 2.2.x).
- The same releases also included fixes for other vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2019-11358 jQuery pollution), which is why they are often mentioned together in the provided information.
