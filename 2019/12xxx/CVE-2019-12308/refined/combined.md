Subject: Django: CVE-2019-12308 AdminURLFieldWidget XSS (plus patched bundled
 jQuery for CVE-2019-11358)

In accordance with `our security release policy
<<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/>>`_, the Django team
is issuing `Django 1.11.21
<<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.11.21/>>`_, `Django 2.1.9
<<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.1.9/>>`_, and `Django 2.2.2
<<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.2.2/>>`_. These releases
addresses the security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django
to upgrade as soon as possible.

CVE-2019-12308: AdminURLFieldWidget XSS
=======================================

The clickable "Current URL" link generated by ``AdminURLFieldWidget`` displayed
the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. Thus, an unvalidated
value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter
payload, could result in an clickable JavaScript link.

``AdminURLFieldWidget`` now validates the provided value using ``URLValidator``
before displaying the clickable link. You may customise the validator by
passing a ``validator_class`` kwarg to ``AdminURLFieldWidget.__init__()``, e.g.
when using ``ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides``.

Affected versions
-----------------

* Django master development branch
* Django 2.2 before version 2.2.2
* Django 2.1 before version 2.1.9
* Django 1.11 before version 1.11.21

Patched bundled jQuery for CVE-2019-11358: Prototype pollution
==============================================================

jQuery before 3.4.0, mishandles ``jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...)`` because of
``Object.prototype`` pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an
enumerable ``__proto__`` property, it could extend the native
``Object.prototype``.

The bundled version of jQuery used by the Django admin has been patched to
allow for the ``select2`` library's use of ``jQuery.extend()``.

Affected versions
-----------------

* Django master development branch
* Django 2.2 before version 2.2.2
* Django 2.1 before version 2.1.9

Resolution
==========

Patches to resolve these issues have been applied to Django's master branch and
the 2.2, 2.1, and 1.11 release branches. The patches may be obtained from the
following changesets:

# CVE-2019-14232

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14204.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14233.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14232 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14232)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars\_html and truncatewords\_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.

# Django 2.1.9 release notes[¶](#django-2-1-9-release-notes "Link to this heading")

*June 3, 2019*

Django 2.1.9 fixes security issues in 2.1.8.

## CVE-2019-12308: AdminURLFieldWidget XSS[¶](#cve-2019-12308-adminurlfieldwidget-xss "Link to this heading")

The clickable “Current URL” link generated by `AdminURLFieldWidget` displayed
the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. Thus, an unvalidated
value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter
payload, could result in an clickable JavaScript link.

`AdminURLFieldWidget` now validates the provided value using
[`URLValidator`](../../ref/validators/#django.core.validators.URLValidator "django.core.validators.URLValidator") before displaying the clickable
link. You may customize the validator by passing a `validator_class` kwarg to
`AdminURLFieldWidget.__init__()`, e.g. when using
[`formfield_overrides`](../../ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides "django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides").

## Patched bundled jQuery for CVE-2019-11358: Prototype pollution[¶](#patched-bundled-jquery-for-cve-2019-11358-prototype-pollution "Link to this heading")

jQuery before 3.4.0, mishandles `jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...)` because of
`Object.prototype` pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an
enumerable `__proto__` property, it could extend the native
`Object.prototype`.

The bundled version of jQuery used by the Django admin has been patched to
allow for the `select2` library’s use of `jQuery.extend()`.

# Django’s security policies[¶](#django-s-security-policies "Link to this heading")

Django’s development team is strongly committed to responsible
reporting and disclosure of security-related issues. As such, we’ve
adopted and follow a set of policies which conform to that ideal and
are geared toward allowing us to deliver timely security updates to
the official distribution of Django, as well as to third-party
distributions.

## Reporting security issues[¶](#reporting-security-issues "Link to this heading")

**Short version: please report security issues by emailing
security@djangoproject.com**.

Most normal bugs in Django are reported to [our public Trac instance](https://code.djangoproject.com/query), but
due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that they **not** be
publicly reported in this fashion.

Instead, if you believe you’ve found something in Django which has security
implications, please send a description of the issue via email to
`security@djangoproject.com`. Mail sent to that address reaches the [security
team](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#security-team).

Once you’ve submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment
from a member of the security team within 48 hours, and depending on the
action to be taken, you may receive further followup emails.

Sending encrypted reports

If you want to send an encrypted email (*optional*), the public key ID for
`security@djangoproject.com` is `0xfcb84b8d1d17f80b`, and this public
key is available from most commonly-used keyservers.

## How does Django evaluate a report[¶](#how-does-django-evaluate-a-report "Link to this heading")

These are criteria used by the security team when evaluating whether a report
requires a security release:

* The vulnerability is within a [supported version](#security-support) of
  Django.
* The vulnerability applies to a production-grade Django application. This means
  the following do not require a security release:

  + Exploits that only affect local development, for example when using
    [`runserver`](../../ref/django-admin/#django-admin-runserver).
  + Exploits which fail to follow security best practices, such as failure to
    sanitize user input. For other examples, see our [security
    documentation](../../topics/security/#cross-site-scripting).
  + Exploits in AI generated code that do not adhere to security best practices.

The security team may conclude that the source of the vulnerability is within
the Python standard library, in which case the reporter will be asked to report
the vulnerability to the Python core team. For further details see the [Python
security guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/security/).

On occasion, a security release may be issued to help resolve a security
vulnerability within a popular third-party package. These reports should come
from the package maintainers.

If you are unsure whether your finding meets these criteria, please still report
it [privately by emailing security@djangoproject.com](#reporting-security-issues). The security team will review your report and
recommend the correct course of action.

## Supported versions[¶](#supported-versions "Link to this heading")

At any given time, the Django team provides official security support
for several versions of Django:

* The [main development branch](https://github.com/django/django/), hosted on GitHub, which will become the
  next major release of Django, receives security support. Security issues that
  only affect the main development branch and not any stable released versions
  are fixed in public without going through the [disclosure process](#security-disclosure).
* The two most recent Django release series receive security
  support. For example, during the development cycle leading to the
  release of Django 1.5, support will be provided for Django 1.4 and
  Django 1.3. Upon the release of Django 1.5, Django 1.3’s security
  support will end.
* [Long-term support release](../release-process/#term-Long-term-support-release)s will receive security updates for a
  specified period.

When new releases are issued for security reasons, the accompanying
notice will include a list of affected versions. This list is
comprised solely of *supported* versions of Django: older versions may
also be affected, but we do not investigate to determine that, and
will not issue patches or new releases for those versions.

## How Django discloses security issues[¶](#how-django-discloses-security-issues "Link to this heading")

Our process for taking a security issue from private discussion to
public disclosure involves multiple steps.

Approximately one week before public disclosure, we send two notifications:

First, we notify [django-announce](../mailing-lists/#django-announce-mailing-list) of the date and approximate time of the
upcoming security release, as well as the severity of the issues. This is to
aid organizations that need to ensure they have staff available to handle
triaging our announcement and upgrade Django as needed. Severity levels are:

* **High**

  + Remote code execution
  + SQL injection
* **Moderate**

  + Cross site scripting (XSS)
  + Cross site request forgery (CSRF)
  + Denial-of-service attacks
  + Broken authentication
* **Low**

  + Sensitive data exposure
  + Broken session management
  + Unvalidated redirects/forwards
  + Issues requiring an uncommon configuration option

Second, we notify a list of [people and organizations](#security-notifications), primarily composed of operating-system vendors and
other distributors of Django. This email is signed with the PGP key of someone
from [Django’s release team](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#releasers-team) and consists of:

* A full description of the issue and the affected versions of Django.
* The steps we will be taking to remedy the issue.
* The patch(es), if any, that will be applied to Django.
* The date on which the Django team will apply these patches, issue
  new releases and publicly disclose the issue.

On the day of disclosure, we will take the following steps:

1. Apply the relevant patch(es) to Django’s codebase.
2. Issue the relevant release(s), by placing new packages on the [Python
   Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/Django/) and on the [djangoproject.com website](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/), and tagging the new release(s)
   in Django’s git repository.
3. Post a public entry on [the official Django development blog](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/),
   describing the issue and its resolution in detail, pointing to the
   relevant patches and new releases, and crediting the reporter of
   the issue (if the reporter wishes to be publicly identified).
4. Post a notice to the [django-announce](../mailing-lists/#django-announce-mailing-list) and oss-security@lists.openwall.com
   mailing lists that links to the blog post.

If a reported issue is believed to be particularly time-sensitive –
due to a known exploit in the wild, for example – the time between
advance notification and public disclosure may be shortened
considerably.

Additionally, if we have reason to believe that an issue reported to
us affects other frameworks or tools in the Python/web ecosystem, we
may privately contact and discuss those issues with the appropriate
maintainers, and coordinate our own disclosure and resolution with
theirs.

The Django team also maintains an [archive of security issues
disclosed in Django](../../releases/security/).

## Who receives advance notification[¶](#who-receives-advance-notification "Link to this heading")

The full list of people and organizations who receive advance
notification of security issues is not and will not be made public.

We also aim to keep this list as small as effectively possible, in
order to better manage the flow of confidential information prior to
disclosure. As such, our notification list is *not* simply a list of
users of Django, and being a user of Django is not sufficient reason
to be placed on the notification list.

In broad terms, recipients of security notifications fall into three
groups:

1. Operating-system vendors and other distributors of Django who
   provide a suitably-generic (i.e., *not* an individual’s personal
   email address) contact address for reporting issues with their
   Django package, or for general security reporting. In either case,
   such addresses **must not** forward to public mailing lists or bug
   trackers. Addresses which forward to the private email of an
   individual maintainer or security-response contact are acceptable,
   although private security trackers or security-response groups are
   strongly preferred.
2. On a case-by-case basis, individual package maintainers who have
   demonstrated a commitment to responding to and responsibly acting
   on these notifications.
3. On a case-by-case basis, other entities who, in the judgment of the
   Django development team, need to be made aware of a pending
   security issue. Typically, membership in this group will consist of
   some of the largest and/or most likely to be severely impacted
   known users or distributors of Django, and will require a
   demonstrated ability to responsibly receive, keep confidential and
   act on these notifications.

Security audit and scanning entities

As a policy, we do not add these types of entities to the notification
list.

## Requesting notifications[¶](#requesting-notifications "Link to this heading")

If you believe that you, or an organization you are authorized to
represent, fall into one of the groups listed above, you can ask to be
added to Django’s notification list by emailing
`security@djangoproject.com`. Please use the subject line “Security
notification request”.

Your request **must** include the following information:

* Your full, real name and the name of the organization you represent,
  if applicable, as well as your role within that organization.
* A detailed explanation of how you or your organization fit at least
  one set of criteria listed above.
* A detailed explanation of why you are requesting security notifications.
  Again, please keep in mind that this is *not* simply a list for users of
  Django, and the overwhelming majority of users should subscribe to
  [django-announce](../mailing-lists/#django-announce-mailing-list) to receive advanced notice of when a security release will
  happen, without the details of the issues, rather than request detailed
  notifications.
* The email address you would like to have added to our notification
  list.
* An explanation of who will be receiving/reviewing mail sent to that
  address, as well as information regarding any automated actions that
  will be taken (i.e., filing of a confidential issue in a bug
  tracker).
* For individuals, the ID of a public key associated with your address
  which can be used to verify email received from you and encrypt
  email sent to you, as needed.

Once submitted, your request will be considered by the Django
development team; you will receive a reply notifying you of the result
of your request within 30 days.

Please also bear in mind that for any individual or organization,
receiving security notifications is a privilege granted at the sole
discretion of the Django development team, and that this privilege can
be revoked at any time, with or without explanation.

Provide all required information

A failure to provide the required information in your initial contact
will count against you when making the decision on whether or not to
approve your request.

# USN-4043-1: Django vulnerabilities

1 July 2019

Several security issues were fixed in Django.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

It was discovered that Django incorrectly handled certain inputs.

An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.10 and Ubuntu 19.04.

([CVE-2019-12308](/security/CVE-2019-12308))

Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly handled HTTP detection when used behind a reverse-proxy. Client requests made via HTTP would cause incorrect API results and would not be redirected to HTTPS, contrary to expectations. ([CVE-2019-12781](/security/CVE-2019-12781))

# Other ways to give

* [Official merchandise store](https://django.threadless.com/) - Buy official t-shirts, accessories, and more to support Django.
* [Sponsor Django via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/django).
* [Benevity Workplace Giving Program](/foundation/donate/#benevity-giving) - If your employer participates, you can make donations to the DSF via payroll deduction.

## Why give to the Django Software Foundation?

Our main focus is direct support of Django's developers. This means:

* Organizing and funding development sprints so that Django's developers can meet in person.
* Helping key developers attend these sprints and other community events by covering travel expenses to official Django events.
* Providing financial assistance to community development and outreach projects such as [Django Girls](#django-girls).
* Providing financial assistance to individuals so they can attend major conferences and events.
* Funding the [Django Fellowship program](#fellowship-program), which provides full-time staff to perform community management tasks in the Django community.

Still curious? See our [Frequently Asked Questions](/foundation/donate/) about donations.

## Django Fellowship Program

The biggest expense of the DSF is the Django Fellowship program. It's a project where [paid contractors](#who-are-the-django-fellows) are engaged to manage some of the administrative and community management tasks of the Django project to support rapid development of Django itself.

**The Django Fellowship program has a major positive impact on how Django is developed and maintained.** The Django Fellows triage 10-15 new tickets each week and review and merge around fifteen non-trivial patches a week from the community. Release blocking and severe bugs aren't postponed indefinitely. Major releases happen according to an 8 month schedule and bug fix releases occur monthly.

For more details, you can read retrospectives for the  [first three months of the program](/weblog/2015/jan/21/django-fellowship-retrospective/), [2015](/weblog/2015/dec/17/fellowship-2015-retrospective/), and [2016](/weblog/2016/dec/28/fellowship-2016-retrospective/).

The Django Fellows are a resource to help review patches and contributions from the community, and the community loves that:

> When I started contributing to Django, patches - especially non-trivial ones - had a tendency to languish in the pull request queue. I eventually gave up on contributing altogether after some of my contributions remained unreviewed for months. Then Tim started dedicating a lot of time to Django and reviewed my contributions. The timely reviews and fast feedback loop acted as catalyst and together we've landed over a hundred patches including 4 major features for Django 1.7 in a matter of months. The churn rate on Django contributors has been very high historically and the Fellowship program is a direct answer to that; it's a great chance for Django and for everyone who relies on it.

**If you use Django on a daily basis and care about the development of Django itself, you should donate today** (may be [tax deductible](/foundation/donate/#tax-deductible)). Only with your support can we make sure that the web framework you base your work on can grow to be even better in the coming years.

## Django Girls Outreach

Supporting [Django Girls workshops](https://djangogirls.org/) is a significant priority for the Django Software Foundation. Django Girls workshops are organized by volunteers and are provided as free events for women who want to learn to code. The workshop serves as an introduction to Python and Django, where attendees learn usable skills to build their first web app.

Django Girls workshop attendees go on to organize their own workshops, lead in their community, and secure full-time jobs as developers. Read their stories in the “Your Django Story” series on the  [Django Girls blog](https://blog.djangogirls.org/).

In 2015, the Django Software Foundation contributed $5,400 to eighteen Django Girls workshops around the world. Here's what some of the organizers had to say about the impact:

> Sponsorship from the DSF allowed us to have on-site child care for our Django Girls Portland workshop. We hosted 2 young children and an infant, and provided them with healthy snacks, games, sidewalk chalk, finger paint, and emoji stickers. Without our nanny, 3 of our attendees wouldn't have been able to come to the workshop. Finger paint photo is  [on the blog](https://blog.djangogirls.org/post/124680859493/django-girls-portland-a-retrospective)!
>
> *Lacey - Portland, Oregon, US*

> The DSF supported [Django Girls Poland](https://djangogirls.org/warsaw/) four times this year and the impact was enormous! In Poland, diversity awareness is not a very common topic. When we approached different local companies about our workshops they usually didn't get what we were actually doing and why it is important. If not for the DSF, we probably would not have been able to hold our workshops at all. Our first workshops were the only until now workshops that were 100% female - female only coaches and female only attendees. Thanks to you, we were able to focus on gathering female mentors instead of searching for sponsors!
>
> *Ania - Wrocław, Poland*

> [Django Girls Seoul](https://pyfound.blogspot.kr/2015/10/django-girls-seoul-great-success.html) had 425 applicants from 11 different countries ages ranging from 16 to 50 years old. After acceptances, we had about 105 people to feed and caffeinate! Thanks to Django's sponsorship we could get all of our participants coffee for the day. It really made a huge difference because we all know how a cup of coffee can change the atmosphere and mood! We were so grateful to the sponsorship we received from abroad. We tried to get sponsorship from a lot of Korean companies but the same generosity doesn't translate well into a Korean Business culture, I guess. This made us even more thankful for our friends at the DSF!

## What is the Django Software Foundation?

Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations, the goal of the [Django Software Foundation](/foundation/) is to promote, support, and advance the Django web framework. If you're interested in how the Django Software Foundation supports the Django web framework, we published a  [Summary of 2014.](/weblog/2015/jan/08/django-software-foundation-2014/)

## Who are the Django Fellows?

There are currently two Django Fellows:

**[Sarah Boyce](https://github.com/sarahboyce) (2024-present)** - an active community member, co-creator of [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space) and a member of Django's review and triage team since 2023. Sarah  [began as a full-time Fellow in April 2024](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/mar/22/welcome-our-new-fellow-sarah-boyce/).

**[Natalia Bidart](https://github.com/nessita) (2023-present)** - a seasoned Django user with extensive experience in architecting, building, and maintaining scalable web services, as well as leading new feature design and development. Natalia  [began as a part-time Fellow in April 2023](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/mar/31/welcome-our-new-fellow-natalia-bidart/).

Former Django Fellows:

He has contributed to more than a dozen open-source projects. Mariusz began as a full-time Fellow in April 2019. In 2024 Mariusz retired after five years of service.

**[Carlton Gibson](https://github.com/carltongibson) (2018-2023)** - a longtime Django user, core contributor to Django REST Framework, maintainer of Django Filter and Django Crispy Forms, and a contributor to many other packages in the Django ecosystem. Carlton began as a part-time Fellow in January 2018. In 2023 Carlton retired after five years of service.

**[Tim Graham](https://github.com/timgraham) (2014- 2019)** - the inaugural Django Fellow, a member of the Django team since 2010, and a longtime major contributor and reviewer. In 2018 Tim transitioned to part-time and in 2019 retired after four years of service.

# Django 2.2.2 release notes[¶](#django-2-2-2-release-notes "Link to this heading")

*June 3, 2019*

Django 2.2.2 fixes security issues and several bugs in 2.2.1.

## CVE-2019-12308: AdminURLFieldWidget XSS[¶](#cve-2019-12308-adminurlfieldwidget-xss "Link to this heading")

The clickable “Current URL” link generated by `AdminURLFieldWidget` displayed
the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. Thus, an unvalidated
value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter
payload, could result in an clickable JavaScript link.

`AdminURLFieldWidget` now validates the provided value using
[`URLValidator`](../../ref/validators/#django.core.validators.URLValidator "django.core.validators.URLValidator") before displaying the clickable
link. You may customize the validator by passing a `validator_class` kwarg to
`AdminURLFieldWidget.__init__()`, e.g. when using
[`formfield_overrides`](../../ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides "django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.formfield_overrides").

## Patched bundled jQuery for CVE-2019-11358: Prototype pollution[¶](#patched-bundled-jquery-for-cve-2019-11358-prototype-pollution "Link to this heading")

jQuery before 3.4.0, mishandles `jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...)` because of
`Object.prototype` pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an
enumerable `__proto__` property, it could extend the native
`Object.prototype`.

The bundled version of jQuery used by the Django admin has been patched to
allow for the `select2` library’s use of `jQuery.extend()`.

### Bugfixes[¶](#bugfixes "Link to this heading")

* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2 that stopped Show/Hide toggles working on
  dynamically added admin inlines ([#30459](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30459)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2 where deprecation message crashes if
  `Meta.ordering` contains an expression ([#30463](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30463)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2.1 where
  [`SearchVector`](../../ref/contrib/postgres/search/#django.contrib.postgres.search.SearchVector "django.contrib.postgres.search.SearchVector") generates SQL with a
  redundant `Coalesce` call ([#30488](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30488)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2 where auto-reloader doesn’t detect changes
  in `manage.py` file when using `StatReloader` ([#30479](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30479)).
* Fixed crash of [`ArrayAgg`](../../ref/contrib/postgres/aggregates/#django.contrib.postgres.aggregates.ArrayAgg "django.contrib.postgres.aggregates.ArrayAgg") and
  [`StringAgg`](../../ref/contrib/postgres/aggregates/#django.contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg "django.contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg") with `ordering`
  argument when used in a `Subquery` ([#30315](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30315)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2 that caused a crash of auto-reloader when
  an exception with custom signature is raised ([#30516](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30516)).
* Fixed a regression in Django 2.2.1 where auto-reloader unnecessarily reloads
  translation files multiple times when using `StatReloader`
  ([#30523](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30523)).

# Other ways to give

* [Official merchandise store](https://django.threadless.com/) - Buy official t-shirts, accessories, and more to support Django.
* [Sponsor Django via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/django).
* [Benevity Workplace Giving Program](/foundation/donate/#benevity-giving) - If your employer participates, you can make donations to the DSF via payroll deduction.

## Why give to the Django Software Foundation?

Our main focus is direct support of Django's developers. This means:

* Organizing and funding development sprints so that Django's developers can meet in person.
* Helping key developers attend these sprints and other community events by covering travel expenses to official Django events.
* Providing financial assistance to community development and outreach projects such as [Django Girls](#django-girls).
* Providing financial assistance to individuals so they can attend major conferences and events.
* Funding the [Django Fellowship program](#fellowship-program), which provides full-time staff to perform community management tasks in the Django community.

Still curious? See our [Frequently Asked Questions](/foundation/donate/) about donations.

## Django Fellowship Program

The biggest expense of the DSF is the Django Fellowship program. It's a project where [paid contractors](#who-are-the-django-fellows) are engaged to manage some of the administrative and community management tasks of the Django project to support rapid development of Django itself.

**The Django Fellowship program has a major positive impact on how Django is developed and maintained.** The Django Fellows triage 10-15 new tickets each week and review and merge around fifteen non-trivial patches a week from the community. Release blocking and severe bugs aren't postponed indefinitely. Major releases happen according to an 8 month schedule and bug fix releases occur monthly.

For more details, you can read retrospectives for the  [first three months of the program](/weblog/2015/jan/21/django-fellowship-retrospective/), [2015](/weblog/2015/dec/17/fellowship-2015-retrospective/), and [2016](/weblog/2016/dec/28/fellowship-2016-retrospective/).

The Django Fellows are a resource to help review patches and contributions from the community, and the community loves that:

> Django's fellowship program allowed me to rediscover programming. By contributing to Django, I learned, through Tim's timely and complete reviews of my contributions, that programming is more than just code -- it is the systematic approach to design, code, review, documentation, and testing of software. I am indebted to Tim and the Django Software Foundation's fellowship program for this.
>
> *Jorge Cardoso Leitão, Django contributor*

**If you use Django on a daily basis and care about the development of Django itself, you should donate today** (may be [tax deductible](/foundation/donate/#tax-deductible)). Only with your support can we make sure that the web framework you base your work on can grow to be even better in the coming years.

## Django Girls Outreach

Supporting [Django Girls workshops](https://djangogirls.org/) is a significant priority for the Django Software Foundation. Django Girls workshops are organized by volunteers and are provided as free events for women who want to learn to code. The workshop serves as an introduction to Python and Django, where attendees learn usable skills to build their first web app.

Django Girls workshop attendees go on to organize their own workshops, lead in their community, and secure full-time jobs as developers. Read their stories in the “Your Django Story” series on the  [Django Girls blog](https://blog.djangogirls.org/).

In 2015, the Django Software Foundation contributed $5,400 to eighteen Django Girls workshops around the world. Here's what some of the organizers had to say about the impact:

> Sponsorship from the DSF allowed us to have on-site child care for our Django Girls Portland workshop. We hosted 2 young children and an infant, and provided them with healthy snacks, games, sidewalk chalk, finger paint, and emoji stickers. Without our nanny, 3 of our attendees wouldn't have been able to come to the workshop. Finger paint photo is  [on the blog](https://blog.djangogirls.org/post/124680859493/django-girls-portland-a-retrospective)!
>
> *Lacey - Portland, Oregon, US*

> The DSF supported [Django Girls Poland](https://djangogirls.org/warsaw/) four times this year and the impact was enormous! In Poland, diversity awareness is not a very common topic. When we approached different local companies about our workshops they usually didn't get what we were actually doing and why it is important. If not for the DSF, we probably would not have been able to hold our workshops at all. Our first workshops were the only until now workshops that were 100% female - female only coaches and female only attendees. Thanks to you, we were able to focus on gathering female mentors instead of searching for sponsors!
>
> *Ania - Wrocław, Poland*

> [Django Girls Seoul](https://pyfound.blogspot.kr/2015/10/django-girls-seoul-great-success.html) had 425 applicants from 11 different countries ages ranging from 16 to 50 years old. After acceptances, we had about 105 people to feed and caffeinate! Thanks to Django's sponsorship we could get all of our participants coffee for the day. It really made a huge difference because we all know how a cup of coffee can change the atmosphere and mood! We were so grateful to the sponsorship we received from abroad. We tried to get sponsorship from a lot of Korean companies but the same generosity doesn't translate well into a Korean Business culture, I guess. This made us even more thankful for our friends at the DSF!

## What is the Django Software Foundation?

Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations, the goal of the [Django Software Foundation](/foundation/) is to promote, support, and advance the Django web framework. If you're interested in how the Django Software Foundation supports the Django web framework, we published a  [Summary of 2014.](/weblog/2015/jan/08/django-software-foundation-2014/)

## Who are the Django Fellows?

There are currently two Django Fellows:

**[Sarah Boyce](https://github.com/sarahboyce) (2024-present)** - an active community member, co-creator of [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space) and a member of Django's review and triage team since 2023.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14233 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14233)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. Due to the behaviour of the underlying HTMLParser, django.utils.html.strip\_tags would be extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs containing large sequences of nested incomplete HTML entities.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12781 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12781)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Django 1.11 before 1.11.22, 2.1 before 2.1.10, and 2.2 before 2.2.3. An HTTP request is not redirected to HTTPS when the SECURE\_PROXY\_SSL\_HEADER and SECURE\_SSL\_REDIRECT settings are used, and the proxy connects to Django via HTTPS. In other words, django.http.HttpRequest.scheme has incorrect behavior when a client uses HTTP.

Hash: SHA256

Package        : python-django
Version        : 1.7.11-1+deb8u6
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12308
Debian Bug     : #931316

It was discovered that the Django Python web development framework
did not correct identify HTTP connections when a reverse proxy
connected via HTTPS.

When deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Django via HTTPS
django.http.HttpRequest.scheme would incorrectly detect client
requests made via HTTP as using HTTPS. This resulted in incorrect
results for is_secure(), and build_absolute_uri(), and that HTTP
requests would not be redirected to HTTPS in accordance with
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT.

HttpRequest.scheme now respects SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER, if it is
configured, and the appropriate header is set on the request, for
both HTTP and HTTPS requests.

If you deploy Django behind a reverse-proxy that forwards HTTP
requests, and that connects to Django via HTTPS, be sure to verify
that your application correctly handles code paths relying on scheme,
is_secure(), build_absolute_uri(), and SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in python-django version
1.7.11-1+deb8u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

Regards,

# Archive of security issues[¶](#archive-of-security-issues "Link to this heading")

Django’s development team is strongly committed to responsible
reporting and disclosure of security-related issues, as outlined in
[Django’s security policies](../../internals/security/).

As part of that commitment, we maintain the following historical list
of issues which have been fixed and disclosed. For each issue, the
list below includes the date, a brief description, the [CVE identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures)
if applicable, a list of affected versions, a link to the full
disclosure and links to the appropriate patch(es).

Some important caveats apply to this information:

* Lists of affected versions include only those versions of Django
  which had stable, security-supported releases at the time of
  disclosure. This means older versions (whose security support had
  expired) and versions which were in pre-release (alpha/beta/RC)
  states at the time of disclosure may have been affected, but are not
  listed.
* The Django project has on occasion issued security advisories,
  pointing out potential security problems which can arise from
  improper configuration or from other issues outside of Django
  itself. Some of these advisories have received CVEs; when that is
  the case, they are listed here, but as they have no accompanying
  patches or releases, only the description, disclosure and CVE will
  be listed.

## Issues under Django’s security process[¶](#issues-under-django-s-security-process "Link to this heading")

…_PROXY_SSL_HEADER if set.

An HTTP request would not be redirected to HTTPS when the
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER and SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT settings were used if
the proxy connected to Django via HTTPS.

HttpRequest.scheme will now always trust the SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER if
set, rather than falling back to the request scheme when the
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER did not have the secure value.

Thanks to Gavin Wahl for the report and initial patch suggestion, and
Shai Berger for review.

|  |  | When deployed behind a reverse-proxy connecting to Django via HTTPS, |

|  |  | :meth:`~django.http.HttpRequest.is\_secure`, and |
|  |  | :meth:`~django.http.HttpRequest.build\_absolute\_uri`, and that HTTP |
|  |  | requests would not be redirected to HTTPS in accordance with |

|  |  | If you deploy Django behind a reverse-proxy that forwards HTTP requests, and |

## Django security releases issued: 2.2.2, 2.1.9 and 1.11.21

Posted by **Carlton Gibson** on June 3, 2019

In accordance with [our security release policy](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/), the Django team is issuing [Django 1.11.21](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.11.21/), [Django 2.1.9](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.1.9/), and [Django 2.2.2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.2.2/). These releases addresses the security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

### CVE-2019-12308: AdminURLFieldWidget XSS

The clickable "Current URL" link generated by AdminURLFieldWidget displayed
the provided value without validating it as a safe URL. Thus, an unvalidated
value stored in the database, or a value provided as a URL query parameter
payload, could result in an clickable JavaScript link.

AdminURLFieldWidget now validates the provided value using URLValidator
before displaying the clickable link. You may customise the validator by
passing a validator\_class kwarg to AdminURLFieldWidget.\_\_init\_\_(), e.g.
when using ModelAdmin.formfield\_overrides.

#### Affected versions

* Django master development branch
* Django 2.2 before version 2.2.2
* Django 2.1 before version 2.1.9
* Django 1.11 before version 1.11.21

### Patched bundled jQuery for CVE-2019-11358: Prototype pollution

jQuery before 3.4.0, mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of
Object.prototype pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an
enumerable \_\_proto\_\_ property, it could extend the native
Object.prototype.

The bundled version of jQuery used by the Django admin has been patched to
allow for the select2 library's use of jQuery.extend().

#### Affected versions

* Django master development branch
* Django 2.2 before version 2.2.2
* Django 2.1 before version 2.1.9

### Resolution

Patches to resolve these issues have been applied to Django's master branch and
the 2.2, 2.1, and 1.11 release branches. The patches may be obtained from the
following changesets:
