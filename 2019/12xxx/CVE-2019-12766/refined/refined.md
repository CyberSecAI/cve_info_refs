- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The subform fieldtype in Joomla! CMS does not sufficiently filter or validate input of subfields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows for XSS attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**  Through the subform fieldtype, by injecting malicious code into subfields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the subfields of a form using the vulnerable subform field type. This may require access to the backend or be possible through vulnerable frontend components.
