        {
            "Root cause": "The AutoPi device generates the Wi-Fi password from a predictable subset of the MD5 hash of the device's serial number. The last 12 characters of this hash are also used in the Wi-Fi SSID, which is publicly broadcast.",
            "Weaknesses": [
                "Predictable password generation",
                "Information exposure through SSID"
             ],
            "Impact": "An attacker can derive the Wi-Fi password by observing the SSID, then use the password to gain root access to the AutoPi device.",
            "Attack vector": "The attack vector is the Wi-Fi network of the AutoPi device, which is accessible within Wi-Fi range.",
            "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the AutoPi device, and has to be able to capture the SSID. The attacker does not need any credentials beforehand."

        {
            "Root cause": "The AutoPi device comes preconfigured with a Wi-Fi network named \"AutoPi QC\" with a default password of \"autopi2019\".",

                "Use of default credentials",
                "Preconfigured network"
            ],
            "Impact": "An attacker can set up a rogue Wi-Fi access point with the same credentials, and the AutoPi device will automatically connect to it. This allows an attacker to perform traffic sniffing, DNS spoofing, and other man-in-the-middle attacks.",
             "Attack vector": "The attack vector is the Wi-Fi client functionality of the AutoPi device, which automatically connects to known Wi-Fi networks.",
            "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to set up a Wi-Fi access point with the specified SSID and password within the range of the AutoPi device."
