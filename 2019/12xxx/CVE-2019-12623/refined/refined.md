Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-12623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the web server within Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) responding with differing error codes when requests are made for existing versus non-existing files. This behavior can be exploited to determine the presence or absence of specific files on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The web server's differentiated error responses constitute an information disclosure vulnerability, specifically a file enumeration issue (CWE-538).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Enumeration:** A successful exploit enables an attacker to enumerate files residing on the affected system. This allows an attacker to map the file system and potentially find files containing sensitive information that can be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network requests.
- **GET Requests:** The attack is carried out by sending GET requests with varying file names to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker requires valid authentication to the web server on the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The initial fix in NFVIS releases 3.12.1 and 3.12.2 was found to be incomplete. A complete fix was implemented in NFVIS releases 4.1 and later.
- There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
