Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of Arbitrary Script Code: Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web interface.
- Access to Sensitive Browser-Based Information: The attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- Crafted Link: The attacker needs to persuade a user of the ISE web interface to click on a crafted link containing the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Cisco ISE web-based management interface.
- Persuasion: The attacker needs to persuade a user of the interface to click a crafted link.
