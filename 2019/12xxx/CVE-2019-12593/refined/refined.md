- **Vulnerability:** Local File Inclusion
- **Affected Software:** IceWarp <= 10.4.4
- **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `style` parameter in the `index.php` file, an attacker can include local files from the server.
- **Impact:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server by exploiting the LFI vulnerability.
- **Weakness:** Unvalidated input allows the attacker to traverse the file system.
- **Root cause:** The application uses the `style` parameter in the `index.php` without proper sanitization, allowing for directory traversal.
