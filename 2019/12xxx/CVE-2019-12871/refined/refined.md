Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-12871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in the parsing of BCP files within Phoenix Contact Automationworx software. Specifically, the software fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it, leading to the use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-After-Free (CWE-416)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, which can result in complete compromise of the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to get access to an original project file to be able to manipulate it.
- The attacker needs to exchange the original file by the manipulated one on the application programming workstation.
- The user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page containing the crafted BCP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate a project file used by the Phoenix Contact Automationworx software.
- The attacker needs to deliver the modified file to the system running the software.
- User interaction is required on the target system, such as opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page.

**Additional details:**
- Affected products: PC Worx through 1.86, PC Worx Express through 1.86, and Config+ through 1.86.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of BCP files.
- The fix implemented by Phoenix Contact includes updating the zlib library to detect corrupted BCP files, improved input data validation, complete initialization of objects, and other general security measures like address space layout randomization.
