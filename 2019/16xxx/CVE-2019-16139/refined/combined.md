Patched

* `>=0.4.0`

Affected Functions
Version
`compact_arena::SmallArena::new`

* `<0.4.0`

### Description

Affected versions of this crate did not properly implement the generativity,
because the invariant lifetimes were not necessarily `drop`ped.

This allows an attacker to mix up two arenas, using indices created from one
arena with another one. This might lead to an out-of-bounds read or write
access into the memory reserved for the arena.

The flaw was corrected by implementing generativity correctly in version 0.4.0.

## Description

![@CAD97](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5992217?u=e652abf6950492999d01ab387d8952edfd72499b&v=4&size=48)[CAD97](https://github.com/CAD97)opened [on May 21, 2019](https://github.com/llogiq/compact_arena/issues/22#issue-446768750)

(sorry; I only found this because I was trying to imitate your closure-less generativity)

```
fn main() {
    compact_arena::mk_arena!(a, 0);
    compact_arena::mk_arena!(b, 0);
    let mut a: compact_arena::SmallArena<'_, usize> = a;
    let b: compact_arena::SmallArena<'_, usize> = b;

    let ix = a.add(0);
    dbg!(b[ix]);
}
```

This successfully compiles and panics with

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
