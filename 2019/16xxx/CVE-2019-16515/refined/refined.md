The provided content relates to CVE-2019-16515.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2019-16515 is the lack of implementation of modern HTTP security headers in the ConnectWise Control application, specifically the missing `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)` and `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)` header.
- Missing `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)` header.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The absence of these headers weakens the application's security posture by missing out on optional security features provided by browsers, although the immediate impact is considered low. The missing headers increase the risk of attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks (due to the absence of HSTS) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks (which can be mitigated by CSP).

**Attack vectors:**
Remote network attacks through HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the ConnectWise Control application. No specific user privilege is required to exploit the missing headers.
