```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection when handling requests to add friendship links.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a logged-in user into submitting a request that adds a malicious link to the friendship links list. This can potentially lead to further attacks such as phishing or drive-by downloads, depending on how the added links are used and displayed by the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that automatically submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. If a logged-in user visits this page, the form will be submitted on their behalf, effectively adding a malicious link.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user into visiting the malicious page. The attacker does not need any specific permissions on the application itself."
