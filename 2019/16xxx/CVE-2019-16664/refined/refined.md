Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16664:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The `groupname` parameter is vulnerable to XSS injection when creating a group. The malicious code injected into the `groupname` is stored and executed when an administrator edits posts within that group or simply visits a specific URL related to topic editing.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker (admin1) creates a new group and injects malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>`) into the `groupname` parameter during the group creation process.
    2.  The attacker invites another user (admin2) to be an administrator of the newly created group. The invite does not require explicit acceptance.
    3.  When admin2 edits any post in the group or visits the URL `http://yourdomian/thinknew/index.php?app=group&ac=topicedit&topicid={your_topic_id_which_easy_to_get}`, the stored XSS payload in the `groupname` is executed in admin2's browser.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser (admin2). This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create groups.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation and output encoding for the `groupname` parameter. Additionally, the lack of consent required for adding group administrators can be considered a contributing factor.
