# Local Privilege Escalation

## CVE-2019-16896

### Affected Products

K7 Ultimate Security version 16.0.0117 (could affect up to and including 16.0.0120; unverified by vendor and I lost the snapshot for that version :( )

### Vulnerability Type

Improper Access Control

### Impact

Arbitrary File Write

### Summary

The backup module improperly validates the administrative privileges of the user, allowing an arbitrary file write via a symbolic link attack with file restoration functionality.

### Exploitation

**Prerequisite condition**: An existing backup set already exists (can this be bypassed?).

1. Create a folder on the desktop and then drop a payload file into the new folder (this example will use `C:\Users\Standard-User\Desktop\bad\payload.exe`),
2. Open the K7 GUI in a debugger,
3. Place a breakpoint on DLL load of `K7BKCExt.dll`,
4. Open the back up window on the GUI,
5. Click "Manage Backup",
6. On the breakpoint of `K7BKCExt.dll`, place another breakpoint on `OpenBackUpMainWindow` exported function of the loaded DLL,
7. Continue the debugger until it stops at the `OpenBackUpMainWindow` breakpoint,
8. Place a breakpoint on the offset `0xA901` from `K7BKCExt.dll` base address,
9. Continue the debugger until it hits the breakpoint at function `0xA901`,
10. Return outside of the function to the `test eax, eax` instruction,
11. Modify `eax` from `0` to `1` (bypass administrative check),
12. Continue the debugger,
13. On the back up window, select "Create new Backup Set",
14. Add the file `C:\Users\Standard-User\Desktop\bad\payload.exe` for backup,
15. Returning back to the "Manage Backup" window, select to "Run Backup Now" on the newly created backup set,
16. Close the K7 GUI to release the `C:\Users\Standard-User\Desktop\bad\payload.exe` file handle,
17. Delete `C:\Users\Standard-User\Desktop\bad\payload.exe` from the disk,
18. Use the "CreateSymlink.exe" tool on the command line: `CreateSymlink.exe C:\Users\Standard-User\Desktop\bad\payload.exe C:\Windows\System32\payload.exe`,
19. Open the debugger and readd the `K7BKCExt.dll` breakpoints mentioned above (on the first instruction of `OpenBackUpMainWindow` and on function `0xA901`),
20. On the breakpoint of `OpenBackUpMainWindow`, modify the fifth parameter from `0` to `1`,
21. Continue until the breakpoint in function `0xA901`,
22. Return outside of the function `0xA901` to the `test eax, eax` instruction,
23. Modify the `eax` from `0` to `1`, as done previously,
24. Continue the debugger to open the "Restore files" window,
25. Select the newly created backup set,
26. Select the backed up file `payload.exe`,
27. Select "Original Location",
28. Restore the file,
29. The file should now be written to the `C:\Windows\System32` folder.
