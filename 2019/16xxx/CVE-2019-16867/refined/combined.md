## Description

![@Rand0mPythoner](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18096032?v=4&size=48)[Rand0mPythoner](https://github.com/Rand0mPythoner)opened [on Sep 23, 2019](https://github.com/Neeke/HongCMS/issues/12#issue-496982635)

U need log into manage page and request this page:“[http://127.0.0.1/cms/hongcms/admin/index.php/database/ajax?action=delete”](http://127.0.0.1/cms/hongcms/admin/index.php/database/ajax?action=delete%E2%80%9D).

and POST **file** parameter

file=**#fileName**

if u delete **config.php** and **view install/index.php**, u will reinstall this cms!

like this:

```
POST /hongcms-master/admin/index.php/database/ajax?action=delete HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-Length: 31

```

let's view source code:

local admin/controllers/database.php line 38 to line 41:

`}elseif($action == 'delete'){

$filename = ForceStringFrom('file');

```
		if(@unlink($this->backupDir . $filename)){
			//无动作`

```

var $filename from $\_POST["file"]
