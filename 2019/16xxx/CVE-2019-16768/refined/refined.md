Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-16768

**Description:** Internal exception message exposure in login action.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The application was propagating internal exception messages, such as those arising from database errors, to the user interface (UI) during the login process. These messages were wrapped in a `\Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AuthenticationServiceException` and displayed directly to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Internal system information, including potentially sensitive details about the database or application internals, was being leaked through error messages displayed in the login form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** An attacker could potentially gain insights into the application's internal workings and infrastructure by triggering specific errors during login attempts and analyzing the exposed exception messages. This knowledge could be used to plan more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Attempts:** An attacker would attempt to log in to the application, intentionally triggering internal errors (e.g., by providing invalid credentials or causing a database issue).
- **Error Message Analysis:** The attacker would then analyze the error message displayed in the login form to extract potentially sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to access the application's login form. No special privileges or inside access is required.
- The attacker does not need to know valid credentials to trigger the error.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

- **Specific Code Location:** The vulnerability was related to how error messages were handled in the `src/Sylius/Bundle/UiBundle/Resources/views/Security/_login.html.twig` file.
- **Vulnerable Code:**  The code used `{{ messages.error(last_error.message) }}`, which directly displayed the raw exception message.
- **Fix:** The fix involves using `{{ messages.error(last_error.messageKey) }}` instead, which only displays a predefined message key rather than the full exception message.
- **Affected Versions:** Versions of `sylius/sylius-ui-bundle` and `sylius/sylius` before 1.3.14, 1.4.10, 1.5.7, and 1.6.3 are affected.
- **Severity:** The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Low".
