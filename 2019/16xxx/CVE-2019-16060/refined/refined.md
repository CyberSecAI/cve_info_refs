The content is related to CVE-2019-16060.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `blacklist_keys` configuration in `airbrake-ruby` version 4.2.3 is not being applied to filter out sensitive parameters, such as passwords, from being sent to Airbrake. This is due to a regression introduced in this version.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is the failure to filter out blacklisted keys, resulting in sensitive data exposure. The `blacklist_keys` setting is not respected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Sensitive information like passwords will not be filtered and can be exposed in Airbrake error reports, leading to potential security risks.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited by an application using the vulnerable `airbrake-ruby` gem that logs sensitive data as part of error reporting. There is no need for any direct attacker interaction with the application for the vulnerability to be triggered. An attacker could potentially gain access to the sensitive data if they have access to the Airbrake error reports.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs access to the Airbrake reports. The attacker does not require any capabilities or access to the vulnerable application itself to exploit the vulnerability.
