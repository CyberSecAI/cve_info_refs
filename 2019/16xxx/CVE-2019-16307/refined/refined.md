Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16307:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `webEx` module of Fuji Xerox DocuShare. Specifically, the `handle` parameter in `webExMeetingLogin.jsp` and the `meetingKey` parameter in `deleteWebExMeetingCheck.jsp` are vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): User-supplied input is reflected back to the user's browser without proper encoding or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the context of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web script or HTML injection: Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the victim's browser.
- Potential for account hijacking, session manipulation, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by crafting malicious URLs with injected scripts in the `handle` and `meetingKey` parameters.
- The attacker sends the malicious URL to a victim (e.g., via a link in an email, message, or other means).
- When the victim clicks on the URL, the server reflects the injected script back to the victim's browser and the script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and deliver them to the intended victims.
- The attacker does not need to have prior access to the system. The attack is carried out remotely.

**Technical Details and PoC Examples**
The following PoC examples were provided:
1.  `webExMeetingLogin.jsp`
    `https://[target host]/[DocuShare path]/dsweb/webex/webExMeetingLogin.jsp?handle=asdasd%22;}}%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(`incognito%20lab`)%3C/script%3E`

    This URL demonstrates injecting a JavaScript alert by manipulating the `handle` parameter.

2.  `deleteWebExMeetingCheck.jsp`
    `https://[target host]/[DocuShare path]/dsweb/webex/deleteWebExMeetingCheck.jsp?meetingKey=000001%22;}%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22Incognito%20Lab%22)%3C/script%3E;`

    This URL demonstrates injecting a JavaScript alert by manipulating the `meetingKey` parameter.

**Affected Component:**
- Fuji Xerox DocuShare through version 7.0.0.C1.609 webEx module.
