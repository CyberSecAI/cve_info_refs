{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on web pages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into various fields of the application. When a user views the affected pages, the injected script will execute in their browser, allowing the attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated attacker can inject the XSS payload through multiple input fields, including: 'Customer' fields in Invoices, Sales Orders, and Quotes; 'Item' fields; and 'Customer Name' fields.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account (unprivileged or privileged) on the application and be authenticated to access the vulnerable sections. No special permissions are required."
