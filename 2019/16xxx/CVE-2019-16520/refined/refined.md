Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-16520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The All in One SEO Pack plugin for WordPress, before version 3.2.7, is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs because the plugin improperly handles user-provided SEO descriptions for posts. Specifically, it performs unsafe placeholder replacement within the description field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Encoding:** The plugin escapes HTML entities in the title and description fields before inserting them into the HTML meta tags. However, the plugin processes placeholders in the description field *after* the initial escaping. When a placeholder such as `%post_title%` is used, it is replaced with the *raw* (unescaped) content of the post title.
- **Unsafe Placeholder Replacement:**  The placeholder replacement mechanism does not sanitize or encode the replaced content before inserting it into the meta description tag. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the meta description field. When a victim visits the affected post, the malicious script will execute within their browser.
- **Phishing Attacks:** The attacker can use the injected script to display fake login forms, capturing user credentials.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can perform other actions within the context of the authenticated user, such as making changes to the website or performing unauthorized actions.
- **Potential Server Compromise:** If the attacked user has administrative privileges, this could lead to the execution of PHP code and potential compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the post creation/editing interface within the WordPress admin panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with the ability to create or edit posts. This typically includes roles like "Author," "Editor," or "Administrator."
- **Ability to set post titles and descriptions:** The attacker needs access to the fields within the plugin settings where custom post titles and meta descriptions can be specified.
- **Knowledge of plugin functionality:** The attacker must be aware of the use of placeholders in the description field.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code resides within the `aioseop_class.php` file, specifically lines 4546-4548:
```php
if ( false !== strpos( $description, '%post_title%', 0 ) ) {
    $description = str_replace( '%post_title%', $this->get_aioseop_title( $post, false ), $description );
}
```
- This snippet shows that the plugin uses `str_replace()` to directly insert the post title into the description without proper sanitization.

**Proof of Concept:**
- An attacker can set the post title to:
`test_aiosp_title&<>"';><script src='data:text/javascript,alert(1)'></script>a`
- And set the description to:
`test_aiosp_desc&<>"'; pt:%post_title% wp_title:%wp_title% bd:%blog_description% sd:%site_description% bt: %blog_title% st: %site_title% desc:%description%`
- The `%post_title%` placeholder will be replaced with the raw title, leading to the injection of the `<script>` tag when the page is rendered.

**Recommended Countermeasures:**
- The vendor recommends properly escaping the output using WordPress encoding functions (`esc_*` or `wp_kses_*`) *after* placeholder substitution to prevent the execution of malicious code.
