Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-16575:

**CVE-2019-16575**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** Alauda Kubernetes Suport Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 2.3.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin's connection test method does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of POST request validation makes the connection test method vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Although not explicitly stated as a separate CVE, the text implies a missing permission check in conjunction with the CSRF issue as another part of the same underlying vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can trick a logged-in Jenkins user into sending a request that causes Jenkins to connect to Kubernetes-related paths on an attacker-specified web server.
    *   The attacker can capture 'Secret Text' credentials stored in Jenkins by forcing a connection using attacker-specified credentials IDs.
    *   If no credential ID is provided, the connection uses the default Kubernetes token from `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`, which could allow access to a default Kubernetes instance.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF:** Tricking a logged-in Jenkins user to click a malicious link or submit a malicious form.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged in Jenkins user into performing an action that triggers the vulnerable code.
    *  The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the location of a valid secret.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that there is no fix available for this plugin as of the publication date.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to capture credentials stored in Jenkins, or connect to default Kubernetes instances when no credential ID is supplied.
