## Phoenix Contact Automationworx MWT File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-19-991ZDI-CAN-8097

| CVE ID | [CVE-2019-16675](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-16675) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Phoenix Contact](https://www.phoenixcontact.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Automationworx |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Phoenix Contact Automationworx. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of MWT files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
