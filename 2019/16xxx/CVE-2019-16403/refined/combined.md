## Description

![@VikramRajVashisth](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24871493?v=4&size=48)[VikramRajVashisth](https://github.com/VikramRajVashisth)opened [on Mar 27, 2019](https://github.com/bagisto/bagisto/issues/749#issue-425942250)

**Threat:** sensitive data disclosure

**Risk level:** HIGH

**Complexity:** medium

**Vulnerable functions:** Bagisto front end

The list of functionality mentioned below are designed for customers to change their own values such as address, review etc can also be manipulated by other customers.

**1) Address field:** /bagisto-103-206-131-18/customer/account/addresses/edit/[ item\_value ]

**2) Review:** /bagisto-common/customer/account/reviews/delete/[ item\_value ]

**3) Orders:** /bagisto-common/customer/account/orders/view/[ item\_value ]

**Tool Used:** Burp proxy (to manipulate requests)

**Steps to reproduce the attack:**

**1.1) Address field:**

step:1 create two users

user 1 : demo01@webkul.com

user 2 : demo@example.com (default user on demo)

step:2 Add multiple address to both the users and check their id.

step:3 Edit the address using another users address id which will show you the address of that user.

User1 can modify/view/delete address of User2 and vice versa.

Similarly, same technique can be used to exploit other functions.

**1.2) Product review:**

Review id can be changed to another user's review id to delete review made by another user.

**1.3) Orders :**

Order id can be changed to view orders made by another user.

**Impacts of vulnerability:**

Sensitive data disclosure where an user can easily view another user's data.
