The provided content directly relates to CVE-2019-16403.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the Bagisto e-commerce platform's front-end functionality. Specifically, the system fails to verify if a user is authorized to access or modify data associated with another user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core weakness is the absence of proper authorization checks, allowing users to manipulate requests and access or modify data belonging to other users.
- **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** The application uses predictable IDs in URLs (e.g., address IDs, review IDs, order IDs) without verifying if the user is authorized to access the referenced object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Attackers can view sensitive data of other users, such as addresses and order details.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify and delete data belonging to other users, such as addresses and reviews.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** By changing the IDs in the URLs (e.g. `/customer/account/addresses/edit/[item_value]`), an attacker can access and modify data of other users.
- **Request Manipulation:** Attackers can use a proxy tool (e.g., Burp proxy) to intercept and modify requests, altering the user context or data IDs to bypass access control checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user of the Bagisto platform.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft or intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically requiring familiarity with web proxies.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or elevated access within the system.
