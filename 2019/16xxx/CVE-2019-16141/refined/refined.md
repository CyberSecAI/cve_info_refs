{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect use of `unreachable_unchecked` when the `Lazy` structure is poisoned after a panic during initialization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)"
    ],
    "impact": "Subsequent dereferences of the `Lazy` object after a failed initialization (due to panic) will result in undefined behavior by executing `std::hints::unreachable_unchecked`, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected program behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the initialization function of a `Lazy` object panics, and the object is subsequently dereferenced. This can occur via normal program execution where a program logic error causes the panic, requiring no user interaction. Applications compiled with `panic = 'abort'` are not affected.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges and doesn't require user interaction. The issue arises from normal execution flows that trigger a panic during initialization.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability exists in the `once_cell` crate in versions >= 0.2.5 and < 1.0.1. The functions `once_cell::sync::Lazy::deref`, `once_cell::sync::Lazy::force`, `once_cell::unsync::Lazy::deref`, and `once_cell::unsync::Lazy::force` are affected."
