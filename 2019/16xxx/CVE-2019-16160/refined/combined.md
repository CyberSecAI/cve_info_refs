\*) ike2 - fixed traffic selector address family selection when using IPv6;

\*) ike2 - improved rekeying process with Windows initiators;

\*) ike2 - properly start all initiators to the same remote address;

\*) ipsec - allow inline "passphrase" parameter when importing keys;

\*) ipsec - fixed "eap-radius" authentication method (introduced in v6.45);

\*) ipsec - fixed minor spelling mistakes in logs;

\*) smb - improved stability on x86 and CHR (CVE-2019-16160);

\*) snmp - fixed encrypted data sequence (introduced in v6.44.5);

\*) ssh - fixed carriage return presence in subsequent sessions;

\*) switch - fix port isolation for non-CRS series switch chips;

\*) system - accept only valid string for "name" parameter in "disk" menu (CVE-2019-15055);

\*) upnp - fixed XML parsing (FG-VD-19-110);

\*) watchdog - renamed "no-ping-delay" parameter to "ping-start-after-boot";

\*) winbox - added "auto-erase" parameter to "Tools/SMS" menu;

\*) winbox - added "https-redirect" parameter to "IP/Hotspot/Profiles menu";

\*) winbox - added "revision" parameter to "System/Routerboard" menu;

\*) winbox - removed "max-sms" parameter from "Tools/SMS" menu;

\*) wireless - fixed basic rate reporting in snooper;

**What's new in 6.45.4 (2019-Aug-13 09:04):**

(factory only release)

To upgrade, click "Check for updates" at /system package in your RouterOS configuration interface, or head to our download page: <http://www.mikrotik.com/download>

> \*) crs328 - adjust fan speed based on SFP and CPU temperature;

After reboot my fan speed dropped slowly down to zero. Temperatures are climbing up from ~40 degrees previously (and ~2900rpm fan speed):

Code: Select all
```
/system health> print
         temperature: 49C
     cpu-temperature: 54C
   power-consumption: 41.7W
  board-temperature1: 36C
        psu1-voltage: 26.4V
        psu2-voltage: 52.6V
        psu1-current: 0.3A
        psu2-current: 0.6A
          fan1-speed: 0RPM
          fan2-speed: 0RPM

```

\*EDIT

Things seems to have stabilised now:

Code: Select all
```
/system health> print
         temperature: 56C
     cpu-temperature: 58C
   power-consumption: 42.2W
  board-temperature1: 41C
        psu1-voltage: 26.4V
        psu2-voltage: 52.7V
        psu1-current: 0.3A
        psu2-current: 0.6A
          fan1-speed: 495RPM
          fan2-speed: 390RPM

```

This does not help.

Someone needs to make a post in previous version with a link to this new version so that people who subscribe to previous version, see that a new version is released. Then its ok to close old release.

Yes indeed. I should have known better than to upgrade. Edit: This is a CRS328-24P-4S+

I note that both alibloke and the chart that elbob2002 posted show the temperature stabilized at 58 degrees C. Makes me think that is what it is designed to do. I don't know what the specs for the CPU chips involved are, but as a comparison, the Raspberry Pi does not start throttling to control heat until it gets to 80 degrees C. Based solely on that comparison, 60 C is not bad...

Yea, we would all like to have our CPU chips cold to the touch, but that's not realistic.

"The accuracy of your information could be sucessfully questioned". You are right that the bug consisting in having the firewall too open for GRE was fixed, but bundled with this fix came another bug - the very first GRE packet of a new tunnel is improperly labelled with *connection-state=invalid*.

On the topic of CRS328:

Since there are always going to be conflicting opinions between people who require a quieter experience and don't mind it running hotter (but still within spec) than usual and people who don't mind the noise and prefer running them cooler..

I would like to know what is going on with the CCR1036? because after a while after updates etc .. they lock from nothing even with cooling and low use of cpu the equipment simply crashes and if someone doubts put one like BPG / OSPF or PPPOE and will see who in about 30 days use it will crash out of nowhere. and we have several in the network about 4 months ago we did not have these problems and only happens with the 1036 2s + I'm already until I have to exchange the pppoes servers that eran mikrotik 1036 for cisco huawei and other things that do not crash without explanation and have scalability since mikrotik does nothing but a 1072

It is not a bug. This has being long discussed in 6.45.1 release. The behavior of GRE now is related to CVE-2014-8160.

Read the 6.45.1 topic and you'll find solutions on how to get your GRE up and running. What Mikrotik can do though, is to automatically add filter rules in firewall once one sets up a gre tunnel, or any tunnel dependent on gre.

I have two routers that are doing BGP (they are made redundant by using VRRP ...) Since update on 6.45.5 IPv6 static routes are simply ignored and after BGP becomes stable (after rebooting that was needed for update) I was forced to change gateway to some dummy IP on all static routes in my routing table to make it work again. So basically it seems like it does ignores static routes on boot. Disabling and re-enabling the static route does not help. As I said - I was forced to change gateways on both routes for those specific static routes to make them work again.

To add info to above, this device has been connected to internet for more than a year, first time these messages came up is after upgrade, hence I thought reporting it.

I am getting login failures also in logs, but surely the "bad guys" did not only discover my device now after a year and only trying to access it now?

Maybe RoS is only starting to report these properly now, dont know, maybe I got a "Known bad IP" from PPPoE when I restarted after upgrade, dont know...

Restarted PPPoE to get new IP, nothing so far, will monitor

Good article. Only ... SOHO users almost definitely don't need routing package, that one is needed for advanced routing protocols such as BGP or OSPF ... simple routing (with a few static routes with some default gateway) is performed by system.

Further to above, the upgrade seems to have broken my firewall, all rules that had in-interface-list specified, changed to "unknown", and when you open the rule, it says in-interface-list=all

Hi, After upgrade to 6.45.5 my BGP connections start going to idle state and renews only after enable/disable or some time. They drops each 10mins - 2 hours.

Configuration ir ipsec/over gre and bgp.

I revert all routers to 6.45.3. all works. 6.45.4 didnt mentioned this problem too, but there was RADIUS issue.

I'm not sure if this problem was already mentioned at this forum but I had already few times a problem where after upgrading (ccr) to newest Os - bridges changed the mac address and they have exactly the same ones = conflict and the whole network goes bat crazy.

I know using Admin MAC would avoid this but there should be some kind of security against that by default.

Why not finally offer options to set things manually and everyone can be happy? ([relevant thread](https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?&t=150417))

There is no particular reason to do so, since device must be cooled down when it becomes hot. There are various reasons why this feature has not been implemented yet, although, as I have said in the thread you have mentioned - we are planning to add some basic fan control, however, currently we are unable to tell You when such changes could be available.

UPDATE:

tried the following way

[https://blog.pessoft.com/2019/03/02/mik ... sk-device/](https://blog.pessoft.com/2019/03/02/mikrotik-firmware-remote-upgrade-small-disk-device/)

but it didn't work. Files have been uploaded using Files menu in the root folder. After restart nothing happened. Version remains the same.

UPDATE2 (Problem SOLVED):

dhcp package was missing.

router has 6.45.5

------------------------------

hello

can't update my hap lite from 6.45.3 to 6.45.5:

ERROR: not enough disk space, 7.3MiB is required and only 7.3MiB is free

I have no scripts or anything like this. Just stock firmware updated regularly.

How can I proceed with the upgrade?

Thank you!

Not tested, but may work.

Downgrade to an older or upgrade to beta image that is a smaller image than you currently have installed, then upgrade to 6.45.5, or wait for 6.46 that looks to be smaller.

List of SMIPS version and the size of them.
Code: Select all
```
Version   bytes
6.46.38b  7445921
6.45.5    7689899
6.45.4    7722659
6.45.3    7722646
6.45.2    7808734
6.45.1    7767691
6.45      7767663
6.44.5    7702189
6.43.16   7672934
6.42.12   7533422
```

Problem is that 6.45.x are the largest image for the SMIPS devices. When did upgrade to it, you did barely have space to do so. Then when you try to upgrade from one 6.45 to another 6.45, you have two larger image..

So by changing to an smaller image, you may be able to upgrade to a larger image later.

Doing so, my give you problem with your configuration, so have both a full backup and a readable backup file of you config.

I used my SPF port as WAN but after the upgrade it doesn't work anymore.

If I use the default eht1 it works fine.

Even using the spf as brige for LAN doesn't work.

Anybody an idea ?

I think in your cases there is not enough memory for the cache:

>
> \*) proxy - increased minimal free RAM that can not be used for proxy services;

I've just found the same problem on my test hap lite. Setting, for example, Code: Select all
```
/ip proxy set max-cache-object-size=1KiB
```
 - resolves issue
