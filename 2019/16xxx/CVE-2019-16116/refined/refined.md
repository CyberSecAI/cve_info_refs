Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-16116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an information leakage vulnerability where the CompleteFTP installer writes the administrator's encrypted passphrase, along with other arguments, to a log file ("Bootstrapper.log") located in the installation directory. This log file is readable by any user on the system by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The installer logs sensitive information (an encrypted passphrase) to a file accessible to all users.
*   **Insecure Credential Storage/Handling:** The application stores the admin credentials in a way that can be exposed via command-line arguments, and the reliance on an easily obtained passphrase which is used in the management command-line interface, this passphrase is not validated against its origin.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The manager application accepts the passphrase without proper validation of its source.
*   **Privileged Execution:** The CompleteFTP service runs with SYSTEM privileges by default.
*   **Abuse of Built-in Functionality:** The application's "Process Triggers" feature allows arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A standard user on the local system can gain full administrative rights by leveraging the leaked credentials.
*   **Remote Exploitation (Conditional):** If a user has read access to the installation directory remotely (not a default), remote exploitation could be possible through using a `CompleteFTPManager.exe` binary on their remote system, and the IP/Port of the target server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Once the admin account is hijacked, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with SYSTEM privileges via Process Triggers.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** With SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File Access:** An attacker needs read access to the "Bootstrapper.log" file in the CompleteFTP server install directory.
*   **Command Injection via Log:** The attacker extracts the encrypted passphrase from the log file and uses it as a command-line argument to the `CompleteFTPManager.exe` application.
*   **Exploitation via Application GUI:**  The attacker exploits the CompleteFTPManager.exe application, which is included in the CompleteFTP software and exposed on the management port.
*   **Process Trigger Abuse:** The attacker uses the application's "Process Triggers" feature to execute malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the Windows system where CompleteFTP server is installed.
*   **Read Access to Install Directory:** The attacker needs read permissions to the CompleteFTP installation directory to access the log file. This is a default configuration.
*   **Network Access (for remote exploitation):** If the attacker wants to exploit remotely, they need network connectivity to the target server's management port.
*   **Ability to execute programs on the target:** The attacker needs to execute the `CompleteFTPManager.exe` tool and the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in CompleteFTP Server versions prior to 12.1.3.
*   The vendor released a patch in version 12.1.3 to address the issue.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit for this vulnerability is available on GitHub.
*   The affected log file is "Bootstrapper.log", located in the "Server" subdirectory of the installation folder.
*   The exploitation involves running the `CompleteFTPManager.exe` with arguments copied from the log file.
*   The exploit does not require cracking the admin password, as the encrypted passphrase is sufficient to gain access.
*   The vulnerability can be used to gain arbitrary code execution via the "Process Triggers" feature which executes as SYSTEM.
