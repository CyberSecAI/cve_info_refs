    *   **Impact**: Allows a malicious website to embed the LimeSurvey application in an iframe, potentially tricking users into unintended actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding the vulnerable website in an iframe.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: Requires the victim to visit a malicious site under the attacker's control.
*   **User unaware that SSL encryption should be enforced:** This is an information disclosure vulnerability because the user is not informed about the need to use SSL encryption.
    *  **Weakness**: Missing notification about SSL enforcement.
    *  **Impact**: Potential interception of sensitive data transmitted over an insecure channel.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: An attacker positioned on the network path of the victim user.
*   **Path revelation:** This vulnerability exposes internal paths.
    *   **Weakness**:  Improper error handling and information leakage.
    *   **Impact**:  Information disclosure, potentially aiding further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Exploiting error handling to reveal internal paths.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: Ability to trigger the error leading to path disclosure.
*    **LDAP login non-generic login message:** The login message for LDAP login was too specific, which could reveal more about the system.
     *   **Weakness**: Information disclosure via specific error messages.
     *   **Impact**: Could allow attackers to gather information about the system for further attacks.
     *   **Attack Vector**: Attacking the login mechanism.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: An attacker must attempt to log in.
*   **Equation signs are not masked by default on data export:** This vulnerability exposes potentially sensitive information present in the form of equations.
    *   **Weakness**: Unmasked equation signs during data export.
    *   **Impact**: Potential disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exporting data.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: An attacker must be able to export data.
*   **CSRF cookie missing HTTP only parameter:** The CSRF cookie was missing the `HTTPOnly` flag.
    *   **Weakness**: Missing `HTTPOnly` flag on a sensitive cookie.
    *   **Impact**:  Increased vulnerability to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as JavaScript can access the cookie.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: Ability to inject and execute malicious scripts on the site.
*   **Admin user without permissions can still see plugins page:** This is an authorization bypass vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness**: Inadequate access control.
    *  **Impact**:  Unauthorized information disclosure and potentially further access if coupled with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Accessing the plugins page without sufficient permissions.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker must be a user with limited admin access.
*   **Admin user with settings permissions can run integrity check:** This is an authorization bypass vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness**: Inadequate access control.
     *   **Impact**:  Unauthorized ability to run integrity check.
     *   **Attack Vector**: Running integrity check without sufficient permissions.
     *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker must be a user with settings admin access.
*   **Admin user with limited permissions can view/update/delete reserved menu entries:**  This is an authorization bypass vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness**: Inadequate access control.
    *  **Impact**: Unauthorized modification of menu entries.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Viewing/updating/deleting reserved menu entries without sufficient permissions.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker must be a user with limited admin access.
*   **Admin user can mark other user notification as read:** This is an authorization bypass vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness**: Inadequate access control.
    *   **Impact**: Unauthorized marking of notifications.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Manipulating other user's notifications.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker must be an admin user.
*   **Database backup uses browser cache:** This is an information disclosure vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness**: Improper caching configuration.
    *   **Impact**: Exposing sensitive data in the browser cache.
    *   **Attack Vector**: Accessing the browser cache.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker must have access to the victim's browser.
*   **Browser cache used for exports:** This is an information disclosure vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness**: Improper caching configuration.
     *   **Impact**: Exposing sensitive data in the browser cache.
     *   **Attack Vector**: Accessing the browser cache.
     *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker must have access to the victim's browser.
