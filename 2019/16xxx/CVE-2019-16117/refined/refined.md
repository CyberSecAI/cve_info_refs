Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information:

**1. CVE-2019-16117 Related Information**
   The provided content contains a changeset for the "Photo Gallery" WordPress plugin, specifically highlighting modifications in the `Galleries.php` file. This changeset and the changelog entries suggest the presence of security issues that have been patched. Specifically, the changelog lists multiple security fixes in versions 1.8.31, 1.8.30, 1.8.29, 1.8.28, 1.8.27, 1.8.26, 1.8.25, 1.8.24, 1.8.23, 1.8.22, 1.8.21, 1.8.20, 1.8.19, and others. This indicates a pattern of discovered vulnerabilities in this plugin. The changeset itself also hints at potential vulnerabilities related to sanitization and filtering of user inputs. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2019-16117, the repeated security fixes suggest the content is related to security vulnerabilities in general for the mentioned plugin, and the specific changes in the code provides information related to the weaknesses present. 

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   The root cause of the vulnerability appears to be a lack of proper sanitization and filtering of user-supplied data. Specifically, the code changes focus on:
   - Using `wp_filter_post_kses` for `image_description` and `image_alt_text` fields, indicating that the previous versions did not properly sanitize these fields, leading to potential XSS vulnerabilities.
   - Removing potentially malicious tags like `<a>` from `alt` text after sanitizing using `preg_replace`, again showing that prior versions may have allowed HTML tags in fields that they should not have.
   - Changes in how thumbnail resolutions are handled, which could indicate a previous vulnerability in this area.
  - Additional fixes noted in the changelog include broken access control vulnerabilities, SVG sanitization issues, file upload argument validations, and other security vulnerabilities

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization of `image_description` and `image_alt_text` fields could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into these fields, which could then be executed by other users viewing the gallery.
   - **Broken Access Control:** The changelog mentions "Broken access control vulnerabilities" in versions 1.8.26 and 1.8.16, indicating that some users were able to perform actions they were not authorized to do.
   - **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Issues related to file upload arguments validation and SVG sanitization indicate that there were likely vulnerabilities allowing the upload of malicious files, or files that bypass sanitization rules.
   - **Open Redirects:** The changelog mentions "Open redirect vulnerability" multiple times in versions 1.8.7 and 1.8.3, indicating that attackers could craft URLs that redirect users to malicious sites.
   - **SQL Injection:** Version 1.6.3 lists a fix for SQL Injection.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **XSS:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions, steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
   - **Broken Access Control:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or administrative functions.
   - **File Upload Vulnerabilities:** Attackers could potentially upload malicious files, leading to code execution or other server-side attacks.
   - **Open Redirects:** Attackers could use the open redirect vulnerability to conduct phishing attacks by redirecting users to fake login pages or other malicious sites.
   - **SQL Injection**: Attackers could potentially gain access to the database, modify or delete data.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Through User Input:** By injecting malicious code into image descriptions or alt text fields within the plugin's admin interface.
   - **Through Uploads:** By uploading malicious files, such as SVGs containing embedded scripts.
   - **Through Crafted URLs:** By crafting malicious URLs that exploit open redirect vulnerabilities.
   - **Through Unauthorized Actions:** By exploiting access control vulnerabilities.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Admin Access (for some vulnerabilities):** An attacker would need administrative or editor-level access to the WordPress site to inject malicious code via the admin interface.
   - **Basic Knowledge of HTML/JavaScript:**  To craft malicious XSS payloads, an attacker would need a basic understanding of HTML/JS.
   - **Ability to Upload Files (for some vulnerabilities):** Ability to upload files that may bypass sanitization (like malicious SVG).
   - **Knowledge of Plugin's Structure:** The attacker would need knowledge of how the plugin works to exploit vulnerabilities through direct requests, or understand vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
- The changelog indicates a large number of security fixes over time, which is common with complex plugins.
- The plugin is actively maintained by the vendor as shown by the frequent updates.
- The plugin has an extensive feature set which adds a larger attack surface.

In conclusion, while the specific CVE is not mentioned in the text, the changes and the changelog entries provide detailed information on numerous security fixes related to sanitization, access control, file uploads, and redirects, which directly relate to common web application vulnerabilities. The document provides a good understanding of the types of vulnerabilities present in this plugin.
