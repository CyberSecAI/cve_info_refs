Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `contact_import.php` file in FusionPBX, which uses an unsanitized "query_string" variable taken directly from the URL. This variable is then reflected in the HTML output without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the `query_string` parameter, which leads to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: By crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript code in the `query_string` parameter, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Redirect the user to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL: The attack vector is primarily through a crafted URL. An attacker would need to convince a user to click on this malicious URL while the user is authenticated to the FusionPBX application. This could be achieved via phishing emails, social engineering, or other malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User Target: The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user but needs to target an authenticated user. The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Pierre Jourdan and fixed by Mark J Crane.
- The vulnerability affects FusionPBX up to version 4.5.7.
- The fix is available at the provided GitHub commit link.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.1, which is considered MEDIUM severity.
