  "CVE-2019-16776": {
    "Description": "Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.",
    "Root cause": "The npm CLI fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended `node_modules` directory when processing the `bin` field in `package.json`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Write",
      "Path Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious package publisher can modify or gain access to arbitrary files on a user's system during package installation, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A maliciously crafted package published to a registry",
      "Direct installation of malicious package from git/file path"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": [
      "Ability to publish a package to an npm registry or distribute a malicious package via alternative means",
       "Victim needs to install the malicious package"
    ],
    "Additional Information": {
       "Bypass": "The vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option. Install scripts are a known attack vector of npm, so this vulnerability makes that attack vector much worse.",
       "Severity": "Rated as important severity by SUSE. Rated as low severity by Github. Rated as Medium severity by Red Hat.",
        "CVSSv2 NVD Score": "5.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N",
