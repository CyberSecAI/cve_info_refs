## Key features and enhancements

### Forms forms-sp22

Key features and enhancements in this release include the following:

#### New GA features in AEM Forms ga-aem-forms-sp22

* Added support to enable font embedding in [Interactive Communications Batch APIs](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/interactive-communications/create-interactive-communication?lang=en#output-format-print-channel) - Interactive Communications now includes support for embedding Adobe Ming and Adobe Myungjo fonts in PDFs generated through the Batch API. This enhancement ensures accurate text rendering in generated documents, even when using font subsets, providing improved support for multilingual content in PDF outputs.
* [Table of Content API for PDF Accessibility](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/use-document-services/aem-document-services-programmatically#auto-tag-pdf-documents-auto-tag-api) - AEM Forms on OSGi now support the new TOC Tag API to enhance PDF for accessibility standards. It makes PDFs more accessible for users with assistive technology.
* [Fragment XDP resolution](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/use-document-services/assembler-service#resolve-references-on-crx-repository-resolve-references-on-crx-repository) - AEM Forms on OSGi now resolves Fragment XDPs referenced in Primary XDPs and stored in the AEM CRX Repository.
* [PDF/A compliance enhancements](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/developer-reference/programming-aem-forms-jee/performing-service-operations-using-apis/pdf-a-documents#converting-documents-to-pdfa-documents-converting-documents-to-pdf-a-documents) - Now users can convert PDFs to PDF/A formats (1a, 2a, 3a) for archival purposes while ensuring accessibility and verifying compliance with these standards.
* **Support for Auto Sizing of Font for Static PDF documents** - AEM Forms Designer, OutputService, and FormsService now supports auto sizing of fonts for static PDFs. If the user sets the font size 0 for text, numeric, password, or datetime fields, the font size auto-adjusts within these fields without altering the field’s overall size. To use the feature, users pass a flag in the custom XCI: `<behaviorOverride>patch-LC-3921991:1</behaviorOverride>`.

#### New Beta features in AEM Forms beta-aem-forms-sp22

Send an email from your official address to aem-forms-ea@adobe.com with the list of capabilities that you are interested in.

* [hCaptcha](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/adaptive-forms-basic-authoring/integrate-adaptive-forms-hcaptcha) and [Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA services](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/adaptive-forms-basic-authoring/integrate-adaptive-forms-turnstile): AEM Forms support the following Captcha services:

  + hCaptcha protects forms from bots, spam, and automated abuse by challenging users with a checkbox widget. It ensures that only human users proceed, enhancing security for online transactions.
  + Cloudflare Turnstile offers a security measure that aims to protect forms from automated bots, malicious attacks, spams and unwanted automated traffic. It presents a checkbox on form submission to verify that they are human, before allowing them to submit the form.
* Adaptive Form versioning:

  + [Create multiple versions of an Adaptive Form](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/adaptive-forms-core-components/add-versioning-reviews-comments) - Now users can easily manage variations of existing forms. This process simplifies version control and facilitates comparison for form optimization, all within a single, streamlined workflow.
  + [Compare Adaptive Forms](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/adaptive-forms-core-components/compare-forms-core-components): Now users can easily compare two forms to identify differences. It facilitates smooth collaboration by enabling team members to compare revisions and discuss changes efficiently.

### Sites sites

[The Universal Editor](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/developing/headless/universal-editor/introduction) is now available on AEM 6.5 for headless use cases with the application of a feature pack.

### Assets

The IPTC tab now supports Alt Text and Extended Description text fields. (ASSETS-34918)

## Fixed issues in Service Pack 22 fixed-issues

### Sites sites-6522

#### Accessibility sites-accessibility-6522

* Annotation swatch selector button was missing an accessible name. That is, using a screen reader, there is no human-understandable name for the button to select after entering a new hex value. (SITES-11992)
* The following elements in the left rail menu appear like a list but are not marked up as such in the screen reader:

  + Site
  + Live copy
  + Launch
  + Language Copy
  + Folder
  + CSV Report (SITES-2874)
* The AEM Core Web Content Management requires an accessibility label for hyperlinks in the Rich Text Editor. When a hyperlink is used in the text component, the anchor tag should include the `aria-label` attribute to ensure that screen readers can read and convey the link text accurately for accessibility purposes. (SITES-11511)
* In AEM, interactive elements in the table header in List View do not have the required “button” role. As such, the NVDA screen reader does not announce the expected button roles for the following table headers: Title, Name, Modified, Published, Preview, Template, Operation, Workflow. Each interactive element in the table header should be assigned a “button” role to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies like NVDA. (SITES-10962)

#### Admin User Interface sites-adminui-6522

* In some instances of AEM, the version preview and comparison functionalities were not working as expected across several pages. Specifically:

  + **Preview Issue:** When attempting to preview a page version, an error appears initially. After retrying, the preview results in a blank page.
  + **Version Comparison Issue:** The “Compare to Current” feature only displayed the current version, without highlighting any differences between versions. (SITES-23988)
* An unexpected `<br>` tag appears in the Rich Text Editor (RTE) field when using the `defaultPasteMode` set to `plaintext` during a copy and paste action. This issue results in different markup for the same content, resulting in the same text content being translated twice in a customer’s translation memory. (SITES-23606)
* In AEM 6.5.20.0, a functionality issue was encountered with the **Manage Publication** feature. When selecting a node and scheduling it for future publication, an error message – “Failed to retrieve child resources for selected items” – could appear when trying to include child nodes. This issue was blocking the use of the **Include Children** option, preventing complete publication of the intended content hierarchy. (SITES-23000)
* A template’s “Published” timestamp was not updating in the author environment, even though the template was successfully replicated to the publish instances. The expected behavior was for the timestamp on the author instance to reflect the latest publication, but this update was not occurring as intended. (SITES-21585)
* There was a discrepancy in the count of Incoming Links in the AEM author environment. The left side rail showed fewer links compared to the Classic UI. Also, some Incoming Links that were legitimate, do not work. (SITES-24837)
* Extremely long loading times were being reported when viewing page versions in the Timeline view of AEM. It was taking up to 19 minutes to display versions. This issue was ongoing since the upgrade from AEM 6.4.8 to 6.5.18, significantly disrupting workflow efficiency. (SITES-22468 & SITES-22467)

#### Content Fragments sites-contentfragments-6522

* In the upgraded AEM 6.5.17, saving Content Fragments resulted in the following error: *ERROR: Could not save Content Fragment.* (SITES-22993)
* An issue was identified with an unclosed resource resolver in `ContentFragmentModelOmniSearchHandler` on the publisher in AEM. (SITES-24903)

#### Content Fragments - Admin sites-admin-6522

Clicking the link in the email notification directs the user to the default asset viewer or editor. It does so instead of the Content Fragment editor, even when the asset in the workflow is determined to be a Content Fragment. (SITES-24338)

#### Content Fragments - GraphQL API sites-graphql-api-6522

When using Content Fragments with Multiline Text field items, the markup generated when querying using GraphQL was not retaining the formatting as specified in the HTML. For example, a newline was missing after the list. The impact was that the last paragraph became part of the list. (SITES-23233)

#### Core Backend sites-core-backend-6522

* Recurring `SegmentNotFoundException` errors was reported on an AEM author instance. Restarting the author temporarily resolved the issue but a long-term fix was needed to prevent further occurrences. (SITES-22573)
* An issue was raised regarding the timeline functionality in AEM Sites, specifically around handling missing `cq:lastModified` properties on annotations. After applying AEM 6.5.20, there was uncertainty about whether existing content needed remediation for the missing property, or if the timeline was updated to function correctly without it. (SITES-21861)

#### Core Components sites-core-components-6522

* Following an upgrade from AEM 6.5.18 to 6.5.21, an issue was identified with the functionality that checks the live usage of components. When attempting to scroll for additional items on the Live Usage page, the table failed to load more results even though “Loading more items” was seen in the UI. (SITES-23919)
* An issue was reported with the validation of required fields in an AEM component dialog box containing two tabs. Tab 1 included a Rich Text Editor (RTE) and text fields, while Tab 2 had path fields and text fields. Although all fields are marked as mandatory (`required=true`), error notifications persist incorrectly in Tab 1, even after filling in all required fields. In contrast, errors in Tab 2 cleared as expected. (SITES-23243)
* After migrating to AEM 6.5.21, the HTML Template Language `data-sly-include` statement no longer functioned as expected, specifically failing to support `appendPath` and `prependPath` expressions. As a result, the included resource’s output was not rendered properly, even though it worked correctly prior to the migration. This issue caused rendering failures for resources that rely on these expressions for path manipulation. (GRANITE-52970)

#### Experience Fragments sites-experiencefragments-6522

* Experience Fragments do not sort by title as expected when the **Title** column header is clicked in the List View. A quick flicker of the screen is observed, but it does not sort. (SITES-23706)
* In AEM 6.5.17, an issue was encountered when converting a page component into an Experience Fragment using the out-of-the-box feature. After conversion, the Experience Fragment appeared empty during editing, despite displaying correctly on the page where it was used. The issue stemmed from incorrect node creation: the component node was placed outside the root/container node, violating the template’s structure. You needed to move the component node manually into the correct root/container node to restore the fragment’s editability. (SITES-22974)
* After migrating from AEM 6.5.11 to 6.5.20, Cloud configurations on Experience Fragments were not saving correctly. Although the configurations appeared to save in `crx/de`, they would not display upon reopening the configurations console, indicating an issue with persistence. (SITES-22287)

#### Launches sites-launches-6522

When adding Experience Fragment assets using the tagging filter in AEM production, the user could select it, but then encountered an error after selecting **Create language copy**. The expected behavior was that the Experience Fragment asset selected from the tagging filter was supposed to get added to the translation project. (SITES-24152)

#### Link Checker sites-link-checker-6522

The LinkCheckerTask fails to authenticate because the HTTP client tries NTLM before Basic Authentication, causing the proxy to block users after multiple failed attempts. The system should instead use Basic Authentication to authenticate against the proxy, allowing the LinkCheckerTask services to function correctly. (SITES-25034)

#### MSM - Live Copies sites-msm-live-copies-6522

* When SEO Robots tags are applied to the primary copy and rolled out to Live Copy pages, the values appeared correctly in `crx/de`. However, the values were not reflected in the user interface under the Page Properties of the Live Copy pages. (SITES-23475)
* Errors related to Launches were appearing when an attempt was made to promote a Launch through the user interface. The Promote Launch wizard remained empty, preventing the completion of the promotion process. (SITES-19718)
* Issues arose with Experience Fragments in AEM following attempts to create Live Copies and perform rollouts. The problem occurred when users encountered a `NotFound` error when trying to navigate back to the Experience Fragments management screen from the Rollout screen. (SITES-21933)

#### Page Editor sites-pageeditor-6522

* The Undo button changed the position of the component in addition to changing the text to the last version. (SITES-17465)
* When a copied container component was pasted, it visually appeared twice, resulting in three instances on the page. However, after refreshing the page, the duplicate disappeared, suggesting the issue was likely a temporary visual glitch. (SITES-21890)
* While navigating the Components left pane using the keyboard’s Tab or Shift+Tab keys, multiple text elements were not clearly visible, both visually and in tab mode. This issue affected accessibility, making it difficult to identify or interact with these components during keyboard navigation. (SITES-2266)

#### Replication sites-replication-6522

In AEM 6.5.18 and 6.5.19, on deactivating a parent page, multiple deactivation requests were generated for each child page. This issue also broke the bulk unpublishing of the GraphQL endpoints. (NPR-42075 & NPR42010)

### Assets assets-6522

* While using the Connected Assets feature, the updates made in AEM Assets do not reflect on AEM Sites environment. (ASSETS-42344)
* Issues with the asset publish status when you move assets from one location to another within Experience Manager. (ASSETS-41158)
* Uploading assets using the API results in `unclosed resource resolver` error message. (ASSETS-41049)
* Issues with `AssetReferenceResolverImpl` reference query after upgrading to Adobe Experience Manager, Service Pack 21. (ASSETS-40384)
* In AEM version 6.5.19, while removing one option from the search panel results, it unchecks all other available checkboxes as well. (ASSETS-37335)
* Junk values are displayed in the Excel output while performing the bulk metadata export operation. (ASSETS-37260)
* In AEM version 6.5.19, when you upload an SVG file in UTF-8 format, the output is blurred. (ASSETS-36616)
* `Fetch original rendition for Dynamic Media Connected Assets` option is missing within Connected Assets configuration. (ASSETS-41726)
* Asset properties are saved even if you do not define a value for mandatory fields. (ASSETS-37914)
* If the processing status of an asset is Failed or Metadata Failed, the captions and audio tracks UI does not work appropriately. (ASSETS-37281)
* When you save an asset metadata and try to edit it, the language name does not display. (ASSETS-37281)

#### Dynamic Media assets-dm-6522

A production issue disrupted the migration process when a video upload to Dynamic Media failed, displaying a process failure error in the user interface. (ASSETS-36038)

### Forms forms-bug-fixes-sp22

* The URLs generated for file attachments in saved drafts in AEM Forms do not reflect the configured Apache Sling Resource Resolver Factory mappings. (FORMS-16949)

#### XMLFM forms-xmlfm-sp22

* In AEM Forms Service Pack 21 (6.5.21.0) when a user adds non-standard tags to PDFs using XMLFM, the document fails to comply with PDF specification requirements. (LC-3922484)
* When a user generates a PDF using the Output Service on AEM Forms Service Pack 20 (6.5.20.0), it fails with CORBA.COMM\_FAILURE and displays the error: `15:04:35,973 ERROR [com.adobe.formServer.PA.XMLFormAgentWrapper] (default task-14) ALCOUT-002-013: XMLFormFactory, PAexecute failure: "org.omg.CORBA.COMM_FAILURE"`. The service passes successfully when the Accessibility role “Reference” is excluded from the XDP template’s subform. however, this role is needed for 508 compliance. (LC-3922402)
* When a user converts an XFA form to an AcroForm PDF, it fails. (LC-3922363)
* In AEM Forms Service Pack 19 (6.5.19.0) when a user creates an XDP with the unnamed subforms, FS\_DATA\_SOM appears empty for unnamed subforms. (LC-3922034)

#### Forms Designer forms-designer-sp22

* When a user opens a fragment library by selecting a fragment folder in AEM Forms Designer version 6.5.21.0, it crashes. (LC-3922439)
* When a user uninstalls the 32-bit AEM Forms Designer version 6.5.20.0 and installs AEM Forms Designer version 6.5.21.0, Forms Designer fails to start. The error logs show insufficient memory allocation for the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). (LC-3922404)

### Foundation foundation-6522

In the AEM Assets console, an issue occurred when attempting to reorder DITA documents. The breadcrumb at the top of the path browser dialog box incorrectly displays the node name instead of the node title for the root parent. The correct node title only appears after selecting an item within the breadcrumb, indicating a temporary display error. (NPR-42106)

#### Communities foundation-communities-6522

After upgrading from AEM 6.5.19 to 6.5.20, an issue emerged where `Connection evic` threads failed to close properly after calls to `UgcSearch`. This problem, observed in the production environment, causes these threads to persist and accumulate over time, potentially impacting performance. (NPR-42019)

#### CRX foundation-crx-6522

* Sorting was not working as per **Groups** in the left side menu in CRX Package Manager. (GRANITE-53277)
* The Package Manager in AEM restricts the installation of lower package versions by default but allows forceful installations of older versions. However, using the force install option can interfere with future installations through the standard pipeline. For instance, if version 1.21 is installed and version 1.24 is added, the installation succeeds, listing both versions. However, trying to install version 1.22 over 1.24 fails through the pipeline but works if forcefully installed, listing all versions. Similarly, installing version 1.23 is blocked if version 1.24 is already present, as the pipeline does not permit downgrades. (GRANITE-53263)

#### Granite foundation-granite-6522

* Snapshot packages were being installed in AEM using CURL commands. During installation, the JCR installer scanned the packages by way of the OSGI Installer to ensure that no additional OSGI bundles or configurations are required. If a package version contained “SNAPSHOT,” the OSGI Installer triggered VLT to create a corresponding snapshot package. However, because each AEM author instance runs its own OSGI Installer, both instances may attempt to generate the snapshot simultaneously, leading to session conflicts within the repository. (NPR-42003)
* A lock contention existed in `ScriptDependencyResolver` with AEM 6.5.21. (GRANITE-53181)
* After upgrading AEM to 6.5.21, issues arose when relative paths were used in Sightly (HTL) syntax, such as `data-sly-use`. (GRANITE-53080)

#### Integrations foundation-integrations-6522

* Added legal attribution statement for Cloud Services user interface. (FORMS-16373)
* Addition of read permissions for the **fd-cloudservice** user to access hCaptcha and Turnstile configurations, letting it retrieve the client ID and client secret necessary for captcha rendering and validation. Additionally, an Access Control List model was implemented to manage access to these configurations. (FORMS-16360)

#### Platform foundation-platform-6522

* The Enterprise Information Management tracking introduced in AEM 6.5.18 caused anomalies in calculating product adoption scores. The Adobe Metrics library caused this issue by overwriting user data supplied by the Omega tracking library. As a result, adoption scores for many AEM Sites and AEM Assets customers dropped to zero starting February 2024. (CQ-4358438)
* A critical issue has been identified in the production environment where the Garbage Collector was improperly handling tags. Specifically, when a tag was moved or renamed, the Garbage Collector failed to update the `cq:MovedTo` property, causing the tag to disappear from pages. (CQ-4358293)
* A problem with ContextHub in AEM 6.5.19 was causing segments to resolve incorrectly when a context path was added to an AEM instance. The issue specifically affected the URL field within the JavaScript objects generated by the page component, where the required context path prefix was missing. This omission prevented segments from functioning as expected. (SITES-21852)
* Updated AEM Quickstart to use the library `commons-collections-3.2.2-adobe-2`. The update ensures that the application can continue to run smoothly. (NPR-42150)
* The SMTP OAuth2 setup in AEM 6.5 differs significantly from what is used in AEM as a Cloud Service. To streamline configuration and ensure consistency, the setup in AEM 6.5 needed to be aligned with the standards used in AEM as a Cloud Service. (GRANITE-53273)

#### Security foundation-security-6522

* Issues were encountered with an outdated JSAFE cryptographic library (version 6.0.0) in AEM. A patched bundle with JSAFE version 6.2.5 is included in AEM 6.5.22. (NPR-42006)
* When validating allowed protocols during XSS checks, handlers compare against “http” and “https.” However, the `protocol` property of a URL object returned these values with a trailing colon, such as `http:` and `https:`. This mismatch caused validation issues. To ensure accurate parsing, the protocol check needed to account for the colon or adjust the comparison logic accordingly. (NPR-42119)
* After installing AEM 6.5.21 (the previous version was AEM 6.5.19) on IBM® WebSphere® Liberty Profile and Semeru Java 8.0, it was not possible to open any pages. Error logs indicated issues related to servlet versions that different bundles required. To address this issue, the dependency on `org.apache.felix.http.servlet-api-1.2.0_fragment_full.jar` had to be reverted because it related to the problem. (NPR-42116)
* Several browsers are phasing out support for **SameSite=None** cookies, which are used to allow cross-site access to cookies. As an alternative, **Partitioned cookies** are being introduced. These cookies isolate storage by the context in which they are used, enhancing privacy and security by preventing tracking across sites while still allowing cookies to function within specific partitions, such as embedded third-party content. (GRANITE-51953)

#### Translation foundation-translation-6522

* Added support for recent changes in Core Components to default translation rules. (NPR-42029)
* An issue was identified with the export of XLIFF files in AEM Forms. When using the **Export selection as XLIFF (strings only)** option, the sequence of components was not consistently maintained. However, the sequence remains correct when exporting XLIFF for a specific language. Two files were provided to demonstrate the issue: **DE-CH\_Export.xliff** (correct sequence) and **String\_Export.xliff** (incorrect sequence). (NPR-42118)

#### User interface foundation-ui-6522

* The `coralui-component-dialog` was altering the placement of `cq-dialog-actions`, potentially affecting the layout or behavior of action buttons within dialog boxes in AEM. (NPR-42294)
* The color picker functionality in AEM was malfunctioning. When accessed, it displayed a blank modal, preventing color selection. This issue began after installing AEM 6.5.20 in the Stage environment. The color picker worked correctly *prior* to the update. (NPR-42163)

## Install Experience Manager 6.5.22.0 install

* Experience Manager 6.5.22.0 requires Experience Manager 6.5. See [upgrade documentation](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/deploying/upgrading/upgrade) for detailed instructions.
* The Service Pack download is available on Adobe [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/servicepack/aem-service-pkg-6.5.22.0.zip).
* On a deployment with MongoDB and multiple instances, install Experience Manager 6.5.22.0 on one of the Author instances using the Package Manager.

IMPORTANT

Adobe does not recommend that you remove or uninstall the Experience Manager 6.5.22.0 package. As such, before you install the pack, you should create a backup of the `crx-repository` in case you must roll it back.

### Install the Service Pack on Experience Manager 6.5 install-service-pack

1. Restart the instance before installation if the instance is in update mode (when the instance was updated from an earlier version). Adobe recommends a restart if the current uptime for an instance is high.
2. Before installing, take a snapshot or a fresh backup of your Experience Manager instance.
3. Download the Service Sack from [Software Distribution](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/servicepack/aem-service-pkg-6.5.22.0.zip).
4. Open Package Manager, then select **Upload Package** to upload the package. To know more, see [Package Manager](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/sites/administering/contentmanagement/package-manager).
5. Select the package, then select **Install**.
6. To update the S3 connector, stop the instance after installation of the Service Pack, replace the existing connector with a new binary file provided in the install folder, and restart the instance. See [Amazon S3 Data Store](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/deploying/deploying/data-store-config#upgrading-to-a-new-version-of-the-s-connector).

NOTE

The dialog box on the Package Manager UI sometimes exits during the installation of the Service Pack. Adobe recommends that you wait for error logs to stabilize before accessing the deployment. Wait for the specific logs related to the uninstall of the updater bundle before being assured that the installation is successful. Typically, this issue occurs in the Safari browser but can intermittently occur in any browser.

**Automatic installation**

There are two different methods that you can use to install Experience Manager 6.5.22.0.

* Place the package into `../crx-quickstart/install` folder when the server is available online. The package is automatically installed.
* Use the [HTTP API from Package Manager](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/sites/administering/contentmanagement/package-manager#package-share). Use `cmd=install&recursive=true` so that the nested packages are installed.

NOTE

Experience Manager 6.5.22.0 does not support Bootstrap installation.

**Validate the installation**

To know the platforms that are certified to work with this release, see the [technical requirements](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/deploying/introduction/technical-requirements).

1. The product information page (`/system/console/productinfo`) displays the updated version string `Adobe Experience Manager (6.5.22.0)` under Installed Products.
2. All OSGi bundles are either **ACTIVE** or **FRAGMENT** in the OSGi Console (Use Web Console: `/system/console/bundles`).
3. The OSGi bundle `org.apache.jackrabbit.oak-core` is version 1.22.20 or later (Use Web Console: `/system/console/bundles`).

### Install Service Pack for Experience Manager Forms install-aem-forms-add-on-package

For instructions to install the Service Pack on Experience Manager Forms, see [Experience Manager Forms Service Pack installation instructions](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/release-notes/aem-forms-current-service-pack-installation-instructions).

NOTE

The Adaptive Forms feature, available in [AEM 6.5 QuickStart](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/deploying/deploying/deploy?lang=en), is designed for exploration and evaluation purposes only. For production use, it is essential to obtain a valid license for AEM Forms, as Adaptive Forms functionality requires proper licensing.

### Install GraphQL Index Package for Experience Manager Content Fragments install-aem-graphql-index-add-on-package

Customers using GraphQL must install the [Experience Manager Content Fragment with GraphQL Index Package 1.1.1](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aem.html?package=/content/software-distribution/en/details.html/content/dam/aem/public/adobe/packages/cq650/featurepack/cfm-graphql-index-def-1.1.1.zip).

Doing so lets you add the required index definition based on the features they actually use.

Failure to install this package may result in slow or failed GraphQL queries.

NOTE

Only install this package once per instance; it does not need to be reinstalled with every Service Pack.

### UberJar uber-jar

The UberJar for Experience Manager 6.5.22.0 is available in the [Maven Central repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/adobe/aem/uber-jar/6.5.22/).

To use UberJar in a Maven project, see [how to use UberJar](/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/implementing/developing/devtools/ht-projects-maven) and include the following dependency in your project POM:

```
  <dependency>
  <groupId>com.adobe.aem</groupId>
  <artifactId>uber-jar</artifactId>
  <version>6.5.22</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>

```

NOTE

UberJar and the other related artifacts are available on Maven Central Repository instead of Adobe Public Maven repository (`repo.adobe.com`). The main UberJar file is renamed to `uber-jar-<version>.jar`. So, there is no `classifier`, with `apis` as the value, for the `dependency` tag.

  From Service Pack 13 and above, the following error log has begun to appear which affects the persistence cache:

  | code language-shell |
  | --- |
  | ``` org.h2.mvstore.MVStoreException: The write format 1 is smaller than the supported format 2 [2.0.202/5] at org.h2.mvstore.DataUtils.newMVStoreException(DataUtils.java:1004)     at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.getUnsupportedWriteFormatException(MVStore.java:1059)     at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.readStoreHeader(MVStore.java:878)     at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore.<init>(MVStore.java:455)     at org.h2.mvstore.MVStore$Builder.open(MVStore.java:4052)     at org.h2.mvstore.db.Store.<init>(Store.java:129)  ``` |

  Or

  | code language-shell |
  | --- |
  | ``` org.h2.mvstore.MVStoreException: The write format 1 is smaller than the supported format 2 [2.1.214/5].  ``` |

  To resolve this exception, do the following:

  1. Delete the following two folders from `crx-quickstart/repository/`

     + `cache`
     + `diff-cache`
  2. Install the Service Pack, or restart Experience Manager as a Cloud Service.
     New folders of `cache` and `diff-cache` are automatically created and you no longer experience an exception related to `mvstore` in the `error.log`.
* Update your GraphQL queries that may have used a custom API name for your content model to use the default name of the content model instead.
* A GraphQL query may use the `damAssetLucene` index instead of the `fragments` index. This action might result in GraphQL queries that fail, or take a long time to run.

  To correct the problem, `damAssetLucene` has to be configured to include the following two properties under `/indexRules/dam:Asset/properties`:

  + `contentFragment`

    - `jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"`
    - `name="jcr:content/contentFragment"`
    - `propertyIndex="{Boolean}true"`
    - `type="Boolean"`
  + `model`

    - `jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"`
    - `name="jcr:content/data/cq:model"`
    - `ordered="{Boolean}true"`
    - `propertyIndex="{Boolean}true"`
    - `type="String"`

  After the index definition is changed, a reindexing is required (`reindex` = `true`).

  After these steps, the GraphQL queries should perform faster.
* When trying to move, delete, or publish either Content Fragments, Sites, or Pages, there is an issue when Content Fragment references are fetched. The background query fails. That is, the functionality does not work.
  To ensure correct operation, you must add the following properties to the index definition node `/oak:index/damAssetLucene` (no reindexing is required):

  | code language-xml |
  | --- |
  | ``` "tags": [     "visualSimilaritySearch"   ] "refresh": true  ``` |
* If you upgrade your Experience Manager instance from 6.5.0 - 6.5.4 to the latest Service Pack on Java™ 11, you see `RRD4JReporter` exceptions in the `error.log` file. To stop the exceptions, restart your instance of Experience Manager.
* Users can rename a folder in a hierarchy in Assets and publish a nested folder to Brand Portal. However, the title of the folder is not updated in Brand Portal until the root folder is republished.
* The following errors and warning messages may be displayed during installation of Experience Manager 6.5.x.x:

  + "When the Adobe Target integration is configured in Experience Manager using the Target Standard API (IMS authentication), then exporting Experience Fragments to Target results in wrong offer types getting created. Instead of type “Experience Fragment”/source “Adobe Experience Manager,” Target creates several offers with type “HTML”/source “Adobe Target Classic.”

* Starting with AEM 6.5.15, the Rhino JavaScript Engine provided by the `org.apache.servicemix.bundles.rhino` bundle has a new hoisting behavior. Scripts that use the strict mode (`use strict;`) have to declare their correct variables. Otherwise, they do not get run, and end up throwing a runtime error.
* Installing tagging related out-of-the-box content by way of an official update package resets the languages property of the `/content/cq:tags` node to default. This action is true for Service Packs, Security Service Packs, Extended Feature Packs, Cumulative Feature Packs, patches, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to add it from the properties before installation.

### Known issue for AEM Sites known-issues-aem-sites-6522

* Content Fragments-Preview fails due to DoS protection for a large tree of fragments. See the [KB article about Default GraphQL Query Executor configuration options](/en/docs/experience-cloud-kcs/kbarticles/ka-23945?lang=en) (SITES-17934)
