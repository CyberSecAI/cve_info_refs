The provided content relates to CVE-2019-16246.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/gui/file_viewer.php` endpoint in Solismed v3.3SP1 is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `uploaded_filename` parameter in `/gui/file_viewer.php` is vulnerable to LFI, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files from the underlying server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including local PHP files, an attacker can achieve code execution on the server. The LFI can be chained with the insecure file upload vulnerability to achieve unauthenticated RCE.
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, including sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted GET request to `/gui/file_viewer.php` with a malicious `uploaded_filename` parameter.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to send a specifically crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, potentially using a web browser or a script.

**Additional details:**
- The LFI vulnerability was discovered in the context of an application that uses a Google Docs viewer to display file contents.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to read files and achieve remote code execution.
- A python script was created to automate the exploitation of the LFI vulnerability, including chaining it with an insecure file upload.
