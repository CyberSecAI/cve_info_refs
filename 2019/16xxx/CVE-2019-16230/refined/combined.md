| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1150468#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-09-12 07:55:52 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16230  drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_display.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-16230> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16230> <https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/9/487> ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1150468#c10)  Thomas Zimmermann   2020-02-04 10:43:37 UTC  ``` Looking at  > <https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/9/487>  the radeon change is still missing from v5.5. The other changes are in non-DRM code. Someone with net and/or scsi credentials should look at them. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1150468#c11)  Borislav Petkov   2020-02-14 09:49:28 UTC  ``` Ok, so AFAICT, this CVE is only for the radeon part. And considering how debatable are those "fixes", I think we can simply say that this is not fixed upstream and not fixed in our kernels either. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1150468#c12)  Marcus Meissner   2020-02-21 15:42:44 UTC  ``` The allocation is usually happening on module load, which happens for this driver during bootup.  It is not controllable by an attacker.  It is also unlikely to have an OOM condition at this time.  We will not fix this. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1150468#c13)  Marcus Meissner   2020-02-25 10:53:40 UTC  ``` dispute was also accepted by Mitre. ``` |  |
