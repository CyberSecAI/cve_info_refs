The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in TuziCMS, specifically within the `ZhuantiController.class.php` files in both the `App\Home\Controller` and `App\Mobile\Controller` directories.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of the user-supplied `id` parameter from the GET request into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the code uses  `$id=I('get.id')` to get the id from the request and then uses it in  `$topcate=D('Column')->where("id=$id")->order('column_sort')->relation(true)->select();`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly concatenates the unsanitized user input into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, configuration details, and other data.
- **Database Manipulation:**  The attacker can potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly mentioned, the attacker could potentially craft queries that could lead to a denial of service by overloading the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `group` action of the `ZhuantiController` in both the `Home` and `Mobile` modules. The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. No special privileges or position within the system are required. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Exploitation Examples:**
The provided content gives example exploits to demonstrate the vulnerability:

`http://127.0.0.1/tuzicms/index.php/Zhuanti/group?id=1 and (extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,(select VERSION()),0x7e)))`
`http://127.0.0.1/tuzicms/index.php/Mobile/Zhuanti/group?id=1%20and%20(extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20user()),0x7e)))`

These examples use the `extractvalue` function along with a subquery to extract the database version and current user, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it provides the vulnerable code locations, concrete examples, and a clear description of how to reproduce the vulnerability.
