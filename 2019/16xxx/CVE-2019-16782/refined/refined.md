  "CVE-2019-16782": {
    "description": "There is a possible information leak / session hijacking vulnerability in Rack. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.",
    "root_cause": "The session ID is used directly to query the backing session storage engine, and most storage mechanisms use indexing to speed up lookups. The indexing mechanism uses insecure comparison that is vulnerable to timing attacks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Session Hijacking",
       "Timing Attack"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a timing attack to determine an existing session ID and hijack that session.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can make timed requests to the server and analyze the response times to infer valid session IDs. No authentication is required.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability lies in the way session IDs are handled by Rack and its storage mechanisms. The session ID is stored in a cookie and is the same ID that is used for querying the storage engine. The vulnerability is not specific to Rack, it exists in any application that indexes session ids in a way that is vulnerable to timing attacks (e.g., trie based databases). Patches were released for Rack versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8 which uses a hashed version of the session id to perform lookups in the database. The fixes also included logic to support older session ids."
