Subject: [CVE-2019-16782] Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack
 Vulnerability in Rack

There is a possible information leak / session hijacking vulnerability
in Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
CVE-2019-16782.

Versions Affected:  All.
Not affected:       None.
Fixed Versions:     1.6.12, 2.0.8

There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in
Rack. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing
attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and
indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up
lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it
takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid
session id and hijack the session.

The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session
is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.

Impact
------

The session id stored in a cookie is the same id that is used when
querying the backing session storage engine. Most storage mechanisms
(for example a database) use some sort of indexing in order to speed up
the lookup of that id. By carefully timing requests and session lookup
failures, an attacker may be able to perform a timing attack to
determine an existing session id and hijack that session.

Releases
--------

The 1.6.12 and 2.0.8 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------

There are no known workarounds.

Patches
-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

1-6-session-timing-attack.patch - Patch for 1.6 series
2-0-session-timing-attack.patch - Patch for 2.6 series

Credits

Thanks Will Leinweber for reporting this!

# CVE-2018-16471

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-16470.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-16476.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-16471 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16471)

#### Description

There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rack before 2.0.6 and 1.6.11. Carefully crafted requests can impact the data returned by the `scheme` method on `Rack::Request`. Applications that expect the scheme to be limited to 'http' or 'https' and do not escape the return value could be vulnerable to an XSS attack. Note that applications using the normal escaping mechanisms provided by Rails may not impacted, but applications that bypass the escaping mechanisms, or do not use them may be vulnerable.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1159548#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-12-19 12:22:29 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16782  There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack (RubyGem rack). This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.6.12 and 2.0.8. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session. The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.

# Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability

Low

[tenderlove](/tenderlove)

## Package

Rack
(gem)

## Affected versions

All

## Patched versions

1.6.12, 2.0.8

## Description

There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session.

The session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.

### Impact

The session id stored in a cookie is the same id that is used when querying the backing session storage engine. Most storage mechanisms (for example a database) use some sort of indexing in order to speed up the lookup of that id. By carefully timing requests and session lookup failures, an attacker may be able to perform a timing attack to determine an existing session id and hijack that session.

## Releases

The 1.6.12 and 2.0.8 releases are available at the normal locations.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds.

### Patches

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for

the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a

single changeset.

* 1-6-session-timing-attack.patch - Patch for 1.6 series
* 2-0-session-timing-attack.patch - Patch for 2.6 series

### Credits

Thanks Will Leinweber for reporting this!

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2019-16782

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

For reference, I noticed that Django does by default store sessions in
an index based database - such as mysql or postgresql. So I opened up a
bug report there: <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31412>

I also believe ruby on rails is not vulnerable, at least if you
applications recommended best best practise.

I have been looking at this in detail, and getting somewhat confused.
Especially after looking at the solution for this problem. This means I
am not confident in applying the upstream solution to older
distributions. It seems more invasive then required plus it breaks
existing code. Breaking code is never a good option for a security
update for an old distribution. Nor am I confident in creating a patch
of my own.

Applications appear to have a choice of 3 back ends to store session
information:

1. cookie based - stores data in a browser cookie.
2. pool based - stores data in a in memory hash.
3. memcache

As far as I can tell, neither 1 or 2 would be vulnerable. They don't use
a database that uses an index. In fact, I am not even sure 3 falls into
this category.

But the upstream patch only seems to update the pool backend:
<https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/7fecaee81f59926b6e1913511c90650e76673b38>

OK, the memcache was split up into another Gem, Dalli:
<https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/54600771e3c9628c873fb1140b800ebb52f18e70#diff-ec7f0fcff10d701615d85df33fbbd545>

But I don't see any security advisory against Dalli - did I miss
something?
<https://github.com/petergoldstein/dalli>

The patches for the older versions also patch the cookie based backend
too. The patches seem to be far my invasive then they need to be.

The way the patches were done seems to puzzle me. I would have thought
we just simple change to the database operations to use hash(sid) as the
primary key instead of sid. This is an internal value only and does not
need to be made accessible to the application. As such no API change
required.

However, instead we have introduced the terms "public_id" and
"private_id" - which have nothing to do with public key cryptography.
Instead private_id is the hash(public_id). Both need to be kept secret.
Due to this change, we have introduced an API change that makes no sense
to me.

Furthermore there is justification for this design that also doesn't
make a lot of sense, e.g.
<https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/1432#issuecomment-571688819>

"The private id could be leaked" - huh? If the public id is leaked it is
just as bad. In fact the private id is generated by hashing the public
id. In fact if the private id was leaked - if it weren't for the legacy
lookup, I am not sure there is anything you could do with it. You can't
reverse the hash and regenerate the public id.

"If you're storing the id, which do you want? (Probably not the public
id as you need to look the session up by the private id)" - why would
you want to lookup the session by the private id? Isn't this the job of
the session library?

There is also the aspect that the patch goes to lengths to preserve
existing sessions. But this doesn't make sense with the pool backend,
because sessions will get erased when the application in restarted for
the security update anyway. I am not convinced preserving existing
sessions should be a requirement.

Description :
Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing
web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP requests and responses in
the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web
servers, web frameworks, and software in between (the so-called
middleware) into a single method call.

My B-tree uses minimum unique key with leading duplicates not stored
for all but the leaf nodes - so it would also (eventually - there is so
much noise in the timing measurement) give away the key via timing
attacks.

I had not thought of that angle, and I hope I remember this the next
time I am reinventing session ids.  Now I'm also wondering about other
libraries that manage session ids.  Java servlets in  Apache Tomcat?

I don't understand why this is reported as something Rack-specific.

If I read the patch correctly (which is improbable, as I don't know
Ruby at all), the idea is:

1. The attacker could send various bogus session ids, starting with
all possible valid bytes. The database, if it uses a trie (yes,
strawman example - is it used by any real-world database?) as a data
structure to speed up looking up sessions, will terminate the
comparison early on invalid bytes, thus disclosing them.
2. Given one valid byte of a session id, the attacker tries to extend
it using the same procedure.
3. At the end, the attacker will get a full session ID.

The patch works by making the thing stored in the database as a key
not the session ID in the cookie, but a hash of it. Therefore, step 2
fails, as it is computationally hard to find something with a given
prefix.

On the other hand, I don't see how a timing attack would be possible
on the most common data structures (B-Tree and Hash) used for database
indexes.

Not real-world as the number of installations is maybe 6 now, but
the one I wrote removes leading duplicates from index records (replacing
with a dup count).  I believe that timing the lookups could disclose
bytes as described.  It's super efficient, though.  :-)
