Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the potential vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** NULL Pointer Dereference
*   **Location:** `dct.c:201` in the `idct2d8x8` function.
*   **Root Cause:** The `ftab` pointer is NULL (or has an invalid value like `0xffffffff`) when it's dereferenced at `dct.c:201`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Providing a specially crafted JPEG file (the provided POC file) to `ffjpeg` that triggers the vulnerable code path.
*   **Impact:** Segmentation fault (program crash) due to the NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Reproducibility:** Easily reproducible using the provided POC file and the specified compilation steps.
*   **Affected Environment:** Ubuntu 14.04, 64bit, ffjpeg (master 627c8a9)
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG file to the application.
