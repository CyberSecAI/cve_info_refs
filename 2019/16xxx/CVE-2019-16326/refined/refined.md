  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-16326",
    "cve_description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "extracted_information": {
      "root_cause": "The router relies on client-side protection for authentication and does not perform server-side validation.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Authentication Bypass",
        "CSRF"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and perform any operation on the router, potentially leading to full control. This, combined with CSRF, allows for remote exploitation.",
      "attack_vector": "By sending crafted HTTP requests, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and execute actions on the router. CSRF can be exploited through a malicious web page or other means to force a user to perform unintended actions.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's management interface, either on the local network or remotely if the interface is exposed. For CSRF, the attacker also needs a way to trick an authenticated user into interacting with their malicious content."
