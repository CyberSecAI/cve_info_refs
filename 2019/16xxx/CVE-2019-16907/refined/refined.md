Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, focusing on CVE-2019-16907:

**CVE-2019-16907**

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication and authorization checks within the In-App & Desktop Notification for Jira plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows access to user notifications via a specific URL parameter (`username`) without requiring the user to be logged in or have the necessary permissions to view those notifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The application fails to verify the identity of the user requesting the notifications.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The application does not check if the user has the right to access another user's notifications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can read the notifications of any user by simply knowing their username, this is a privacy violation.
*   The rightful user of the notification will no longer see it, which could hinder workflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint, including the `username` parameter.
    * Example Path: `/plugins/servlet/nfj/PushNotification?username=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jira server running the affected plugin.
*   **Knowledge of usernames:** The attacker must know a valid username on the Jira instance to view its notifications.

While the advisory from syss.de focuses on CVE-2019-16906, the seclists.org entry groups multiple CVEs including CVE-2019-16907 as being related to the same advisory.
*   The advisory details a fix where authorization is implemented before the delivery of the reply.
*   The provided content from packetstormsecurity.com does not contain information related to this CVE and indicates a temporary lockout, and is therefore ignored.
