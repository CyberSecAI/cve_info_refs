Rails forms made easy.

**Simple Form** aims to be as flexible as possible while helping you with powerful components to create
your forms. The basic goal of **Simple Form** is to not touch your way of defining the layout, letting
you find the better design for your eyes. Most of the DSL was inherited from Formtastic,
which we are thankful for and should make you feel right at home.

INFO: This README refers to **Simple Form** 5.0. For older releases, check the related branch for your version.

## Installation

Add it to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'simple_form'
```

Run the following command to install it:

```
bundle install
```

Run the generator:

```
rails generate simple_form:install
```

### Bootstrap 5

**Simple Form** can be easily integrated with [Bootstrap 5](http://getbootstrap.com/).
Use the `bootstrap` option in the install generator, like this:

```
rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap
```

This will add an initializer that configures **Simple Form** wrappers for
Bootstrap 5's [form controls](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/overview/).
You have to be sure that you added a copy of the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
assets on your application.

For more information see the generator output, our
[example application code](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form-bootstrap) and
[the live example app](https://simple-form-bootstrap.herokuapp.com/).

### Zurb Foundation 5

To generate wrappers that are compatible with [Zurb Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/), pass
the `foundation` option to the generator, like this:

```
rails generate simple_form:install --foundation
```

Please note that the Foundation wrapper does not support the `:hint` option by default. In order to
enable hints, please uncomment the appropriate line in `config/initializers/simple_form_foundation.rb`.
You will need to provide your own CSS styles for hints.

Please see the [instructions on how to install Foundation in a Rails app](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/applications.html).

### Country Select

If you want to use the country select, you will need the
[country\_select gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/country_select), add it to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'country_select'
```

If you don't want to use the gem you can easily override this behaviour by mapping the
country inputs to something else, with a line like this in your `simple_form.rb` initializer:

```
config.input_mappings = { /country/ => :string }
```

## Usage

**Simple Form** was designed to be customized as you need to. Basically it's a stack of components that
are invoked to create a complete html input for you, which by default contains label, hints, errors
and the input itself. It does not aim to create a lot of different logic from the default Rails
form helpers, as they do a great job by themselves. Instead, **Simple Form** acts as a DSL and just
maps your input type (retrieved from the column definition in the database) to a specific helper method.

To start using **Simple Form** you just have to use the helper it provides:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username %>
  <%= f.input :password %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

This will generate an entire form with labels for user name and password as well, and render errors
by default when you render the form with invalid data (after submitting for example).

You can overwrite the default label by passing it to the input method. You can also add a hint,
an error, or even a placeholder. For boolean inputs, you can add an inline label as well:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username, label: 'Your username please', error: 'Username is mandatory, please specify one' %>
  <%= f.input :password, hint: 'No special characters.' %>
  <%= f.input :email, placeholder: 'user@domain.com' %>
  <%= f.input :remember_me, inline_label: 'Yes, remember me' %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

In some cases you may want to disable labels, hints or errors. Or you may want to configure the html
of any of them:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username, label_html: { class: 'my_class' }, hint_html: { class: 'hint_class' } %>
  <%= f.input :password, hint: false, error_html: { id: 'password_error' } %>
  <%= f.input :password_confirmation, label: false %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

It is also possible to pass any html attribute straight to the input, by using the `:input_html`
option, for instance:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username, input_html: { class: 'special' } %>
  <%= f.input :password, input_html: { maxlength: 20 } %>
  <%= f.input :remember_me, input_html: { value: '1' } %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

If you want to pass the same options to all inputs in the form (for example, a default class),
you can use the `:defaults` option in `simple_form_for`. Specific options in `input` call will
overwrite the defaults:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user, defaults: { input_html: { class: 'default_class' } } do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username, input_html: { class: 'special' } %>
  <%= f.input :password, input_html: { maxlength: 20 } %>
  <%= f.input :remember_me, input_html: { value: '1' } %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

Since **Simple Form** generates a wrapper div around your label and input by default, you can pass
any html attribute to that wrapper as well using the `:wrapper_html` option, like so:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username, wrapper_html: { class: 'username' } %>
  <%= f.input :password, wrapper_html: { id: 'password' } %>
  <%= f.input :remember_me, wrapper_html: { class: 'options' } %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

Required fields are marked with an \* prepended to their labels.

By default all inputs are required. When the form object includes `ActiveModel::Validations`
(which, for example, happens with Active Record models), fields are required only when there is `presence` validation.
Otherwise, **Simple Form** will mark fields as optional. For performance reasons, this
detection is skipped on validations that make use of conditional options, such as `:if` and `:unless`.

And of course, the `required` property of any input can be overwritten as needed:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name, required: false %>
  <%= f.input :username %>
  <%= f.input :password %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

By default, **Simple Form** will look at the column type in the database and use an
appropriate input for the column. For example, a column created with type
`:text` in the database will use a `textarea` input by default. See the section
[Available input types and defaults for each column
type](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form#available-input-types-and-defaults-for-each-column-type)
for a complete list of defaults.

**Simple Form** also lets you overwrite the default input type it creates:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username %>
  <%= f.input :password %>
  <%= f.input :description, as: :text %>
  <%= f.input :accepts,     as: :radio_buttons %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

So instead of a checkbox for the *accepts* attribute, you'll have a pair of radio buttons with yes/no
labels and a textarea instead of a text field for the description. You can also render boolean
attributes using `as: :select` to show a dropdown.

It is also possible to give the `:disabled` option to **Simple Form**, and it'll automatically mark
the wrapper as disabled with a CSS class, so you can style labels, hints and other components inside
the wrapper as well:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :username, disabled: true, hint: 'You cannot change your username.' %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

**Simple Form** inputs accept the same options as their corresponding input type helper in Rails:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :date_of_birth, as: :date, start_year: Date.today.year - 90,
                              end_year: Date.today.year - 12, discard_day: true,
                              order: [:month, :year] %>
  <%= f.input :accepts, as: :boolean, checked_value: 'positive', unchecked_value: 'negative' %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

By default, **Simple Form** generates a hidden field to handle the un-checked case for boolean fields.
Passing `unchecked_value: false` in the options for boolean fields will cause this hidden field to be omitted,
following the convention in Rails. You can also specify `include_hidden: false` to skip the hidden field:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :just_the_checked_case, as: :boolean, include_hidden: false %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

**Simple Form** also allows you to use label, hint, input\_field, error and full\_error helpers
(please take a look at the rdocs for each method for more info):

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :username %>
  <%= f.input_field :username %>
  <%= f.hint 'No special characters, please!' %>
  <%= f.error :username, id: 'user_name_error' %>
  <%= f.full_error :token %>
  <%= f.submit 'Save' %>
<% end %>
```

Any extra option passed to these methods will be rendered as html option.

### Stripping away all wrapper divs

**Simple Form** also allows you to strip away all the div wrappers around the `<input>` field that is
generated with the usual `f.input`.
The easiest way to achieve this is to use `f.input_field`.

Example:

```
simple_form_for @user do |f|
  f.input_field :name
  f.input_field :remember_me, as: :boolean
end
```

```
<form>
  ...
  <input class="string required" id="user_name" maxlength="255" name="user[name]" size="255" type="text">
  <input name="user[remember_me]" type="hidden" value="0">
  <label class="checkbox">
    <input class="boolean optional" id="user_published" name="user[remember_me]" type="checkbox" value="1">
  </label>
</form>
```

For check boxes and radio buttons you can remove the label changing `boolean_style` from default value `:nested` to `:inline`.

Example:

```
simple_form_for @user do |f|
  f.input_field :name
  f.input_field :remember_me, as: :boolean, boolean_style: :inline
end
```

```
<form>
  ...
  <input class="string required" id="user_name" maxlength="255" name="user[name]" size="255" type="text">
  <input name="user[remember_me]" type="hidden" value="0">
  <input class="boolean optional" id="user_remember_me" name="user[remember_me]" type="checkbox" value="1">
</form>
```

To view the actual RDocs for this, check them out here - [http://rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/simple\_form/main/SimpleForm/FormBuilder:input\_field](http://rubydoc.info/github/heartcombo/simple_form/main/SimpleForm/FormBuilder%3Ainput_field)

### Collections

And what if you want to create a select containing the age from 18 to 60 in your form? You can do it
overriding the `:collection` option:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :user %>
  <%= f.input :age, collection: 18..60 %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

Collections can be arrays or ranges, and when a `:collection` is given the `:select` input will be
rendered by default, so we don't need to pass the `as: :select` option. Other types of collection
are `:radio_buttons` and `:check_boxes`. Those are added by **Simple Form** to Rails set of form
helpers (read Extra Helpers section below for more information).

Collection inputs accept two other options beside collections:

* *label\_method* => the label method to be applied to the collection to retrieve the label (use this
  instead of the `text_method` option in `collection_select`)
* *value\_method* => the value method to be applied to the collection to retrieve the value

Those methods are useful to manipulate the given collection. Both of these options also accept
lambda/procs in case you want to calculate the value or label in a special way eg. custom
translation. You can also define a `to_label` method on your model as **Simple Form** will search for
and use `:to_label` as a `:label_method` first if it is found.

By default, **Simple Form** will use the first item from an array as the label and the second one as the value.
If you want to change this behavior you must make it explicit, like this:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :gender, as: :radio_buttons, collection: [['0', 'female'], ['1', 'male']], label_method: :second, value_method: :first %>
<% end %>
```

All other options given are sent straight to the underlying Rails helper(s): [`collection_select`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html#method-i-collection_select), [`collection_check_boxes`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html#method-i-collection_check_boxes), [`collection_radio_buttons`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html#method-i-collection_radio_buttons). For example, you can pass `prompt` and `selected` as:

```
f.input :age, collection: 18..60, prompt: "Select your age", selected: 21
```

It may also be useful to explicitly pass a value to the optional `:selected` like above, especially if passing a collection of nested objects.

It is also possible to create grouped collection selects, that will use the html *optgroup* tags, like this:

```
f.input :country_id, collection: @continents, as: :grouped_select, group_method: :countries
```

Grouped collection inputs accept the same `:label_method` and `:value_method` options, which will be
used to retrieve label/value attributes for the `option` tags. Besides that, you can give:

* *group\_method* => the method to be called on the given collection to generate the options for
  each group (required)
* *group\_label\_method* => the label method to be applied on the given collection to retrieve the label
  for the *optgroup* (**Simple Form** will attempt to guess the best one the same way it does with
  `:label_method`)

### Priority

**Simple Form** also supports `:time_zone` and `:country`. When using such helpers, you can give
`:priority` as an option to select which time zones and/or countries should be given higher priority:

```
f.input :residence_country, priority: [ "Brazil" ]
f.input :time_zone, priority: /US/
```

Those values can also be configured with a default value to be used on the site through the
`SimpleForm.country_priority` and `SimpleForm.time_zone_priority` helpers.

Note: While using `country_select` if you want to restrict to only a subset of countries for a specific
drop down then you may use the `:collection` option:

```
f.input :shipping_country, priority: [ "Brazil" ], collection: [ "Australia", "Brazil", "New Zealand"]
```

### Associations

To deal with associations, **Simple Form** can generate select inputs, a series of radios buttons or checkboxes.
Lets see how it works: imagine you have a user model that belongs to a company and `has_and_belongs_to_many`
roles. The structure would be something like:

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company
  has_and_belongs_to_many :roles
end

class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :users
end

class Role < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :users
end
```

Now we have the user form:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name %>
  <%= f.association :company %>
  <%= f.association :roles %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

Simple enough, right? This is going to render a `:select` input for choosing the `:company`, and another
`:select` input with `:multiple` option for the `:roles`. You can, of course, change it to use radio
buttons and checkboxes as well:

```
f.association :company, as: :radio_buttons
f.association :roles,   as: :check_boxes
```

The association helper just invokes `input` under the hood, so all options available to `:select`,
`:radio_buttons` and `:check_boxes` are also available to association. Additionally, you can specify
the collection by hand, all together with the prompt:

```
f.association :company, collection: Company.active.order(:name), prompt: "Choose a Company"
```

In case you want to declare different labels and values:

```
f.association :company, label_method: :company_name, value_method: :id, include_blank: false
```

Please note that the association helper is currently only tested with Active Record. It currently
does not work well with Mongoid and depending on the ORM you're using your mileage may vary.

### Buttons

All web forms need buttons, right? **Simple Form** wraps them in the DSL, acting like a proxy:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name %>
  <%= f.button :submit %>
<% end %>
```

The above will simply call submit. You choose to use it or not, it's just a question of taste.

The button method also accepts optional parameters, that are delegated to the underlying submit call:

```
<%= f.button :submit, "Custom Button Text", class: "my-button" %>
```

To create a `<button>` element, use the following syntax:

```
<%= f.button :button, "Custom Button Text" %>

<%= f.button :button do %>
  Custom Button Text
<% end %>
```

### Wrapping Rails Form Helpers

Say you wanted to use a rails form helper but still wrap it in **Simple Form** goodness? You can, by
calling input with a block like so:

```
<%= f.input :role do %>
  <%= f.select :role, Role.all.map { |r| [r.name, r.id, { class: r.company.id }] }, include_blank: true %>
<% end %>
```

In the above example, we're taking advantage of Rails 3's select method that allows us to pass in a
hash of additional attributes for each option.

### Extra helpers

**Simple Form** also comes with some extra helpers you can use inside rails default forms without relying
on `simple_form_for` helper. They are listed below.

#### Simple Fields For

Wrapper to use **Simple Form** inside a default rails form. It works in the same way that the `fields_for`
Rails helper, but change the builder to use the `SimpleForm::FormBuilder`.

```
form_for @user do |f|
  f.simple_fields_for :posts do |posts_form|
    # Here you have all simple_form methods available
    posts_form.input :title
  end
end
```

#### Collection Radio Buttons

Creates a collection of radio inputs with labels associated (same API as `collection_select`):

```
form_for @user do |f|
  f.collection_radio_buttons :options, [[true, 'Yes'], [false, 'No']], :first, :last
end
```

```
<input id="user_options_true" name="user[options]" type="radio" value="true" />
<label class="collection_radio_buttons" for="user_options_true">Yes</label>
<input id="user_options_false" name="user[options]" type="radio" value="false" />
<label class="collection_radio_buttons" for="user_options_false">No</label>
```

#### Collection Check Boxes

Creates a collection of checkboxes with labels associated (same API as `collection_select`):

```
form_for @user do |f|
  f.collection_check_boxes :options, [[true, 'Yes'], [false, 'No']], :first, :last
end
```

```
<input name="user[options][]" type="hidden" value="" />
<input id="user_options_true" name="user[options][]" type="checkbox" value="true" />
<label class="collection_check_box" for="user_options_true">Yes</label>
<input name="user[options][]" type="hidden" value="" />
<input id="user_options_false" name="user[options][]" type="checkbox" value="false" />
<label class="collection_check_box" for="user_options_false">No</label>
```

To use this with associations in your model, you can do the following:

```
form_for @user do |f|
  f.collection_check_boxes :role_ids, Role.all, :id, :name # using :roles here is not going to work.
end
```

To add a CSS class to the label item, you can use the `item_label_class` option:

```
f.collection_check_boxes :role_ids, Role.all, :id, :name, item_label_class: 'my-custom-class'
```

## Available input types and defaults for each column type

The following table shows the html element you will get for each attribute
according to its database definition. These defaults can be changed by
specifying the helper method in the column `Mapping` as the `as:` option.

| Mapping | Generated HTML Element | Database Column Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `boolean` | `input[type=checkbox]` | `boolean` |
| `string` | `input[type=text]` | `string` |
| `citext` | `input[type=text]` | `citext` |
| `email` | `input[type=email]` | `string` with `name =~ /email/` |
| `url` | `input[type=url]` | `string` with `name =~ /url/` |
| `tel` | `input[type=tel]` | `string` with `name =~ /phone/` |
| `password` | `input[type=password]` | `string` with `name =~ /password/` |
| `search` | `input[type=search]` | - |
| `uuid` | `input[type=text]` | `uuid` |
| `color` | `input[type=color]` | `string` |
| `text` | `textarea` | `text` |
| `hstore` | `textarea` | `hstore` |
| `json` | `textarea` | `json` |
| `jsonb` | `textarea` | `jsonb` |
| `file` | `input[type=file]` | `string` responding to file methods |
| `hidden` | `input[type=hidden]` | - |
| `integer` | `input[type=number]` | `integer` |
| `float` | `input[type=number]` | `float` |
| `decimal` | `input[type=number]` | `decimal` |
| `range` | `input[type=range]` | - |
| `datetime` | `datetime select` | `datetime/timestamp` |
| `date` | `date select` | `date` |
| `time` | `time select` | `time` |
| `weekday` | `select` (weekdays as options) | - |
| `select` | `select` | `belongs_to`/`has_many`/`has_and_belongs_to_many` associations |
| `radio_buttons` | collection of `input[type=radio]` | `belongs_to` associations |
| `check_boxes` | collection of `input[type=checkbox]` | `has_many`/`has_and_belongs_to_many` associations |
| `country` | `select` (countries as options) | `string` with `name =~ /country/` |
| `time_zone` | `select` (timezones as options) | `string` with `name =~ /time_zone/` |
| `rich_text_area` | `trix-editor` | - |

## Custom inputs

It is very easy to add custom inputs to **Simple Form**. For instance, if you want to add a custom input
that extends the string one, you just need to add this file:

```
# app/inputs/currency_input.rb
class CurrencyInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::Base
  def input(wrapper_options)
    merged_input_options = merge_wrapper_options(input_html_options, wrapper_options)

    "$ #{@builder.text_field(attribute_name, merged_input_options)}".html_safe
  end
end
```

And use it in your views:

```
f.input :money, as: :currency
```

Note, you may have to create the `app/inputs/` directory and restart your webserver.

You can also redefine existing **Simple Form** inputs by creating a new class with the same name. For
instance, if you want to wrap date/time/datetime in a div, you can do:

```
# app/inputs/date_time_input.rb
class DateTimeInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::DateTimeInput
  def input(wrapper_options)
    template.content_tag(:div, super)
  end
end
```

Or if you want to add a class to all the select fields you can do:

```
# app/inputs/collection_select_input.rb
class CollectionSelectInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::CollectionSelectInput
  def input_html_classes
    super.push('chosen')
  end
end
```

If needed, you can namespace your custom inputs in a module and tell **Simple Form** to look for
their definitions in this module. This can avoid conflicts with other form libraries (like Formtastic) that look up
the global context to find inputs definition too.

```
# app/inputs/custom_inputs/numeric_input
module CustomInputs
  class NumericInput < SimpleForm::Inputs::NumericInput
    def input_html_classes
      super.push('no-spinner')
    end
  end
end
```

And in the **SimpleForm** initializer :

```
# config/simple_form.rb
config.custom_inputs_namespaces << "CustomInputs"
```

## Custom form builder

You can create a custom form builder that uses **Simple Form**.

Create a helper method that calls `simple_form_for` with a custom builder:

```
def custom_form_for(object, *args, &block)
  options = args.extract_options!
  simple_form_for(object, *(args << options.merge(builder: CustomFormBuilder)), &block)
end
```

Create a form builder class that inherits from `SimpleForm::FormBuilder`.

```
class CustomFormBuilder < SimpleForm::FormBuilder
  def input(attribute_name, options = {}, &block)
    super(attribute_name, options.merge(label: false), &block)
  end
end
```

## I18n

**Simple Form** uses all power of I18n API to lookup labels, hints, prompts and placeholders. To customize your
forms you can create a locale file like this:

```
en:
  simple_form:
    labels:
      user:
        username: 'User name'
        password: 'Password'
    hints:
      user:
        username: 'User name to sign in.'
        password: 'No special characters, please.'
    placeholders:
      user:
        username: 'Your username'
        password: '****'
    include_blanks:
      user:
        age: 'Rather not say'
    prompts:
      user:
        role: 'Select your role'
```

And your forms will use this information to render the components for you.

**Simple Form** also lets you be more specific, separating lookups through actions.
Let's say you want a different label for new and edit actions, the locale file would
be something like:

```
en:
  simple_form:
    labels:
      user:
        username: 'User name'
        password: 'Password'
        edit:
          username: 'Change user name'
          password: 'Change password'
```

This way **Simple Form** will figure out the right translation for you, based on the action being
rendered. And to be a little bit DRYer with your locale file, you can specify defaults for all
models under the 'defaults' key:

```
en:
  simple_form:
    labels:
      defaults:
        username: 'User name'
        password: 'Password'
        new:
          username: 'Choose a user name'
    hints:
      defaults:
        username: 'User name to sign in.'
        password: 'No special characters, please.'
    placeholders:
      defaults:
        username: 'Your username'
        password: '****'
```

**Simple Form** will always look for a default attribute translation under the "defaults" key if no
specific is found inside the model key.

In addition, **Simple Form** will fallback to default `human_attribute_name` from Rails when no other
translation is found for labels. Finally, you can also overwrite any label, hint or placeholder
inside your view, just by passing the option manually. This way the I18n lookup will be skipped.

For `:prompt` and `:include_blank` the I18n lookup is optional and to enable it is necessary to pass
`:translate` as value.

```
f.input :role, prompt: :translate
```

**Simple Form** also has support for translating options in collection helpers. For instance, given a
User with a `:role` attribute, you might want to create a select box showing translated labels
that would post either `:admin` or `:editor` as value. With **Simple Form** you could create an input
like this:

```
f.input :role, collection: [:admin, :editor]
```

And **Simple Form** will try a lookup like this in your locale file, to find the right labels to show:

```
en:
  simple_form:
    options:
      user:
        role:
          admin: 'Administrator'
          editor: 'Editor'
```

You can also use the `defaults` key as you would do with labels, hints and placeholders. It is
important to notice that **Simple Form** will only do the lookup for options if you give a collection
composed of symbols only. This is to avoid constant lookups to I18n.

It's also possible to translate buttons, using Rails' built-in I18n support:

```
en:
  helpers:
    submit:
      user:
        create: "Add %{model}"
        update: "Save Changes"
```

There are other options that can be configured through I18n API, such as required text and boolean.
Be sure to check our locale file or the one copied to your application after you run
`rails generate simple_form:install`.

It should be noted that translations for labels, hints and placeholders for a namespaced model, e.g.
`Admin::User`, should be placed under `admin_user`, not under `admin/user`. This is different from
how translations for namespaced model and attribute names are defined:

```
en:
  activerecord:
    models:
        admin/user: User
    attributes:
        admin/user:
            name: Name
```

They should be placed under `admin/user`. Form labels, hints and placeholders for those attributes,
though, should be placed under `admin_user`:

```
en:
  simple_form:
    labels:
        admin_user:
            name: Name
```

This difference exists because **Simple Form** relies on `object_name` provided by Rails'
FormBuilder to determine the translation path for a given object instead of `i18n_key` from the
object itself. Thus, similarly, if a form for an `Admin::User` object is defined by calling
`simple_form_for @admin_user, as: :some_user`, **Simple Form** will look for translations
under `some_user` instead of `admin_user`.

When translating `simple_fields_for` attributes be sure to use the same name you pass to it, e.g. `simple_fields_for :posts` should be placed under `posts` not `post`:

```
en:
  simple_form:
    labels:
      posts:
        title: 'Post title'
    hints:
      posts:
        title: 'A good title'
    placeholders:
      posts:
        title: 'Once upon a time...'
```

## Configuration

**Simple Form** has several configuration options. You can read and change them in the initializer
created by **Simple Form**, so if you haven't executed the command below yet, please do:

`rails generate simple_form:install`

### The wrappers API

With **Simple Form** you can configure how your components will be rendered using the wrappers API.
The syntax looks like this:

```
config.wrappers tag: :div, class: :input,
                error_class: :field_with_errors,
                valid_class: :field_without_errors do |b|

  # Form extensions
  b.use :html5
  b.optional :pattern
  b.use :maxlength
  b.use :placeholder
  b.use :readonly

  # Form components
  b.use :label_input
  b.use :hint,  wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :hint }
  b.use :error, wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :error }
end
```

The *Form components* will generate the form tags like labels, inputs, hints or errors contents.
The available components are:

```
:label         # The <label> tag alone
:input         # The <input> tag alone
:label_input   # The <label> and the <input> tags
:hint          # The hint for the input
:error         # The error for the input
```

The *Form extensions* are used to generate some attributes or perform some lookups on the model to
add extra information to your components.

You can create new *Form components* using the wrappers API as in the following example:

```
config.wrappers do |b|
  b.use :placeholder
  b.use :label_input
  b.wrapper tag: :div, class: 'separator' do |component|
    component.use :hint,  wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :hint }
    component.use :error, wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :error }
  end
end
```

this will wrap the hint and error components within a `div` tag using the class `'separator'`.

You can customize *Form components* passing options to them:

```
config.wrappers do |b|
  b.use :label_input, class: 'label-input-class', error_class: 'is-invalid', valid_class: 'is-valid'
end
```

This sets the input and label classes to `'label-input-class'` and will set the class `'is-invalid'`
if the input has errors and `'is-valid'` if the input is valid.

If you want to customize the custom *Form components* on demand you can give it a name like this:

```
config.wrappers do |b|
  b.use :placeholder
  b.use :label_input
  b.wrapper :my_wrapper, tag: :div, class: 'separator', html: { id: 'my_wrapper_id' } do |component|
    component.use :hint,  wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :hint }
    component.use :error, wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :error }
  end
end
```

and now you can pass options to your `input` calls to customize the `:my_wrapper` *Form component*.

```
# Completely turns off the custom wrapper
f.input :name, my_wrapper: false

# Configure the html
f.input :name, my_wrapper_html: { id: 'special_id' }

# Configure the tag
f.input :name, my_wrapper_tag: :p
```

You can also define more than one wrapper and pick one to render in a specific form or input.
To define another wrapper you have to give it a name, as the follow:

```
config.wrappers :small do |b|
  b.use :placeholder
  b.use :label_input
end
```

and use it in this way:

```
# Specifying to whole form
simple_form_for @user, wrapper: :small do |f|
  f.input :name
end

# Specifying to one input
simple_form_for @user do |f|
  f.input :name, wrapper: :small
end
```

**Simple Form** also allows you to use optional elements. For instance, let's suppose you want to use
hints or placeholders, but you don't want them to be generated automatically. You can set their
default values to `false` or use the `optional` method. Is preferable to use the `optional` syntax:

```
config.wrappers placeholder: false do |b|
  b.use :placeholder
  b.use :label_input
  b.wrapper tag: :div, class: 'separator' do |component|
    component.optional :hint, wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :hint }
    component.use :error, wrap_with: { tag: :span, class: :error }
  end
end
```

By setting it as `optional`, a hint will only be generated when `hint: true` is explicitly used.
The same for placeholder.

It is also possible to give the option `:unless_blank` to the wrapper if you want to render it only
when the content is present.

```
  b.wrapper tag: :span, class: 'hint', unless_blank: true do |component|
    component.optional :hint
  end
```

## Custom Components

When you use custom wrappers, you might also be looking for a way to add custom components to your
wrapper. The default components are:

```
:label         # The <label> tag alone
:input         # The <input> tag alone
:label_input   # The <label> and the <input> tags
:hint          # The hint for the input
:error         # The error for the input
```

A custom component might be interesting for you if your views look something like this:

```
<%= simple_form_for @blog do |f| %>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span1 number">
      1
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
      <%= f.input :title %>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="span1 number">
      2
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
      <%= f.input :body, as: :text %>
    </div>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

A cleaner method to create your views would be:

```
<%= simple_form_for @blog, wrapper: :with_numbers do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :title, number: 1 %>
  <%= f.input :body, as: :text, number: 2 %>
<% end %>
```

To use the number option on the input, first, tells to Simple Form the place where the components
will be:

```
# config/initializers/simple_form.rb
Dir[Rails.root.join('lib/components/**/*.rb')].each { |f| require f }
```

Create a new component within the path specified above:

```
# lib/components/numbers_component.rb
module NumbersComponent
  # To avoid deprecation warning, you need to make the wrapper_options explicit
  # even when they won't be used.
  def number(wrapper_options = nil)
    @number ||= begin
      options[:number].to_s.html_safe if options[:number].present?
    end
  end
end

SimpleForm.include_component(NumbersComponent)
```

Finally, add a new wrapper to the config/initializers/simple\_form.rb file:

```
config.wrappers :with_numbers, tag: 'div', class: 'row', error_class: 'error' do |b|
  b.use :html5
  b.use :number, wrap_with: { tag: 'div', class: 'span1 number' }
  b.wrapper tag: 'div', class: 'span8' do |ba|
    ba.use :placeholder
    ba.use :label
    ba.use :input
    ba.use :error, wrap_with: { tag: 'span', class: 'help-inline' }
    ba.use :hint,  wrap_with: { tag: 'p', class: 'help-block' }
  end
end
```

## HTML 5 Notice

By default, **Simple Form** will generate input field types and attributes that are supported in HTML5,
but are considered invalid HTML for older document types such as HTML4 or XHTML1.0. The HTML5
extensions include the new field types such as email, number, search, url, tel, and the new
attributes such as required, autofocus, maxlength, min, max, step.

Most browsers will not care, but some of the newer ones - in particular Chrome 10+ - use the
required attribute to force a value into an input and will prevent form submission without it.
Depending on the design of the application this may or may not be desired. In many cases it can
break existing UI's.

It is possible to disable all HTML 5 extensions in **Simple Form** by removing the `html5`
component from the wrapper used to render the inputs.

For example, change:

```
config.wrappers tag: :div do |b|
  b.use :html5

  b.use :label_input
end
```

To:

```
config.wrappers tag: :div do |b|
  b.use :label_input
end
```

If you want to have all other HTML 5 features, such as the new field types, you can disable only
the browser validation:

```
SimpleForm.browser_validations = false # default is true
```

This option adds a new `novalidate` property to the form, instructing it to skip all HTML 5
validation. The inputs will still be generated with the required and other attributes, that might
help you to use some generic javascript validation.

You can also add `novalidate` to a specific form by setting the option on the form itself:

```
<%= simple_form_for(resource, html: { novalidate: true }) do |form| %>
```

Please notice that none of the configurations above will disable the `placeholder` component,
which is an HTML 5 feature. We believe most of the newest browsers are handling this attribute
just fine, and if they aren't, any plugin you use would take care of applying the placeholder.
In any case, you can disable it if you really want to, by removing the placeholder component
from the components list in the **Simple Form** configuration file.

HTML 5 date / time inputs are not generated by **Simple Form** by default, so using `date`,
`time` or `datetime` will all generate select boxes using normal Rails helpers. We believe
browsers are not totally ready for these yet, but you can easily opt-in on a per-input basis
by passing the html5 option:

```
<%= f.input :expires_at, as: :date, html5: true %>
```

## Using non Active Record objects

There are few ways to build forms with objects that don't inherit from Active Record, as
follows:

You can include the module `ActiveModel::Model`.

```
class User
  include ActiveModel::Model

  attr_accessor :id, :name
end
```

If you are using Presenters or Decorators that inherit from `SimpleDelegator` you can delegate
it to the model.

```
class UserPresenter < SimpleDelegator
  # Without that, Simple Form will consider the user model as the object.
  def to_model
    self
  end
end
```

You can define all methods required by the helpers.

```
class User
  extend ActiveModel::Naming

  attr_accessor :id, :name

  def to_model
    self
  end

  def to_key
    id
  end

  def persisted?
    false
  end
end
```

To have SimpleForm infer the attributes' types, you can provide
`#has_attribute?` and `#type_for_attribute` methods.
The later should return an object that responds to `#type`
with the attribute type. This is useful for generating
the correct input types (eg: checkboxes for booleans).

```
class User < Struct.new(:id, :name, :age, :registered)
  def to_model
    self
  end

  def model_name
    OpenStruct.new(param_key: "user")
  end

  def to_key
    id
  end

  def persisted?
    id.present?
  end

  def has_attribute?(attr_name)
    %w(id name age registered).include?(attr_name.to_s)
  end

  def type_for_attribute(attr_name)
    case attr_name.to_s
      when "id" then OpenStruct.new(type: :integer)
      when "name" then OpenStruct.new(type: :string)
      when "age" then OpenStruct.new(type: :integer)
      when "registered" then OpenStruct.new(type: :boolean)
    end
  end
end
```

If your object doesn't implement those methods, you must make explicit it when you are
building the form

```
class User
  attr_accessor :id, :name

  # The only method required to use the f.submit helper.
  def persisted?
    false
  end
end
```

```
<%= simple_form_for(@user, as: :user, method: :post, url: users_path) do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :name %>
  <%= f.submit 'New user' %>
<% end %>
```

## Package

bundler

simple\_form
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 5.0

## Patched versions

5.0 and later

## Description

### Impact

For pages that build a form using user input, it is possible for an attacker to manipulate the input and send any method present in the form object. For example:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
  <%= f.label @user_supplied_string %>
  ...
<% end %>
```

The string provided in the variable `@user_supplied_string` would be invoked as a method call inside the `@user` object (unless the string contains any of the following: `password`, `time_zone`, `country`, `email`, `phone` and `url`).

By manipulation that input, an attacker could do any of the following:

* Code execution (call actions like `#destroy`)
* Denial of Service (by executing a computation intensive method)
* Information Disclosure (check the presence of methods, leak user information)

### Patches

The problem was fixed in version `5.0`. Although it's a major version, there should be no issues with upgrading for `4.x`. The reason it was released in a major version is that the configuration `SimpleForm.file_methods` was deprecated in order to fix the problem.

### Workarounds

The issue only happens with pages that build forms based on user-provided input. If your application doesn't do that, you're not affected.

A workaround is to explicitly pass which type you want for an input since the issue lies on Simple Form's automatically discovery of input types. This can be done using the `as` option, like the following:

```
<%= form.input :avatar, as: :file %>
```

# [Incorrect Access Control in Simple Form (CVE-2019-16676)](/2019/09/incorrect-access-control-in-simple-form-cve-2019-16676/)

Sep 27, 2019

![](https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5940ebc95c761f522ce0f9678a3e7be6?s=32&d=mm&r=pg) Written by [Leonardo Tegon](/?author=54 "Posts by Leonardo Tegon").

Simple Form version `5.0` was released today with a fix for a security issue that could allow an attacker to execute methods on form objects. The issue is explained in details below.

## Description

The issue applies only to forms that are built using user-supplied input. For example, the following form that builds a label based on user input:

```
<%= simple_form_for @user do |form| %>
  <%= form.label @user_supplied_string %>
  ...
<% end %>
Code language: HTML, XML (xml)
```

In this case, the `@user_supplied_string` would be invoked as a method call in the `@user` object (unless the string contains any of the following: `password`, `time_zone`, `country`, `email`, `phone` or `url`).

If you build your forms with backend-provided information only, your application is not affected by this issue.

## Possible implications

By knowing that this breach exists, an attacker could invoke any method on the form object. This means that they could do any of the following:

* Code execution (call unintended actions like `#destroy`)
* Denial of Service (by executing computation-intensive actions)
* Information Disclosure (check the presence of methods, leak user information)

## Cause

The issue is caused by Simple Form’s automatically discover of input types feature. When a form input is provided without the `as` option, the library tries to discover which type that input is. This is done with a regular expression for the most common types. Something like this:

```
case attribute_name.to_s
when /(?:\b|\W|_)password(?:\b|\W|_)/  then :password
when /(?:\b|\W|_)time_zone(?:\b|\W|_)/ then :time_zone
when /(?:\b|\W|_)country(?:\b|\W|_)/   then :country
when /(?:\b|\W|_)email(?:\b|\W|_)/     then :email
when /(?:\b|\W|_)phone(?:\b|\W|_)/     then :tel
when /(?:\b|\W|_)url(?:\b|\W|_)/       then :url
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
```

This works for a bunch of input types but it doesn’t for file inputs. In the case of file inputs, they can have a lot of different names – `avatar`, `attachment`, `profile_image` and so on.

In order to discover file inputs, Simple Form was calling `#send` on the object passing `attribute_name` as the parameter. That would result in an object, which would then later be checked against a list of file methods, to decide whether that attribute should be a file input or not:

```
def file_method?(attribute_name)
  file = @object.send(attribute_name) if @object.respond_to?(attribute_name)
  file && SimpleForm.file_methods.any? { |m| file.respond_to?(m) }
end

```

The default value of the `SimpleForm.file_methods` config was: `[:mounted_as, :file?, :public_filename, :attached?]` which are basically methods present in some popular file upload Gems.

## Solution

Simple Form was changed to check in a different way whether some attribute might be suitable for a file input. It now checks for the presence of methods directly, without calling `#send`. For example, the check for ActiveStorage looks like this:

```
@object.respond_to?("#{attribute_name}_attachment")
Code language: CSS (css)
```

The officially supported Gems are:

* [ActiveStorage](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/6-0-stable/activestorage) >= 5.2
* [Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) >= 0.2.1
* [Refile](https://github.com/refile/refile) >= 0.2.0
* [Shrine](https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine) >= 0.9.0
* [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) >= 2.0 (for backwards compatibility)

Although this new code is harder to maintain, we think it’s worth the tradeoff with more security. See the [commit](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/commit/8c91bd76a5052ddf3e3ab9fd8333f9aa7b2e2dd6) with the solution for more information.

**Note:** This solution does not support multiple file upload inputs, as this is very application-specific. To render file input for multiple file upload, use the `as` option.

## How to upgrade

You might have noticed that we released this fix in a major version (`5.0`). This was done because to fix the issue, we had to fully deprecate the `SimpleForm.file_methods` configuration. There are no other breaking changes in this release, so it should be easy to upgrade.

If you had changed the `SimpleForm.file_methods` configuration to include other methods, please check whether they are from one of the supported Gems. If they are, you should be fine without them. If they are from another upload library, please [open an issue](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/issues/new) asking for support and we’ll take a look into it.

In the meantime, you can explicitly say which type the input is:

```
<%= form.input :avatar, as: :file %>
Code language: HTML, XML (xml)
```
### Can’t upgrade?

If you can’t upgrade for any reason but want to be protected from the security breach, you can also explicitly pass the input type – using `as` – to your user-based forms. That would make Simple Form return early and not execute the user input on the object.

## Acknowledgments

We want to thank [Philipp Tessenow](https://github.com/tessi/), who reported the issue with all the necessary details and was helpful throughout the steps of the fix until the release. Thanks!

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement.
