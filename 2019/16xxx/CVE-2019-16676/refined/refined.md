{
  "CVE-2019-16676": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability stems from an incorrect access control within the `file_method?` function in `lib/simple_form/form_builder.rb`. This flaw allows a user-supplied string to be invoked as a method call on a form object, potentially leading to code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.",
    "details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Simple Form automatically discovers input types, specifically file inputs. When an input is provided without the `as` option, Simple Form attempts to determine the input type. For file inputs, it was calling `#send` on the form object with a user-supplied `attribute_name`, which is attacker controllable. This allowed an attacker to invoke arbitrary methods on the form object.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect access control",
        "Unsanitized user input",
        "Arbitrary method invocation"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker could potentially achieve:\n  - Code execution by calling unintended actions like `#destroy`.\n  - Denial of Service by executing computation-intensive actions.\n  - Information Disclosure by checking for the presence of methods and leaking user information.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating user-supplied input that is used in form building, specifically within the `f.label` method of `simple_form_for`. The user-controlled string, used as attribute_name can then invoke arbitrary methods.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input string used in a form that utilizes Simple Form. This would typically involve controlling data sent to the server via a web form."
    },
    "affected_versions": "< 5.0",
    "patched_versions": "5.0 and later",
    "Workarounds": "Explicitly pass the input type using the `as` option (e.g., `f.input :avatar, as: :file`) when dealing with user-provided input in forms, to prevent the vulnerable code path from being executed."
