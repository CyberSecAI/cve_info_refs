Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-16417

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the HRworks FLOW application. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input when creating travel expense reports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means that malicious scripts injected by an attacker are persistently stored within the application's database and are executed when other users interact with the affected data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unwanted Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected data. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking and account compromise
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the application
    - Distribution of malware
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input Fields:** The attack vector is through user-input fields in the travel expense report creation form. Specifically, most, if not all, fields in the form are vulnerable.
- **Example:** The proof of concept shows that inserting `<script>alert('xss')</script>` as the "purpose" of the travel expense report results in the execution of the injected JavaScript code when the report is viewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the HRworks FLOW application.
- **Ability to create travel expense reports:** The attacker must have permission to create new travel expense reports.
- **No special privileges needed:** No special admin privileges or access beyond the normal user role are required.
