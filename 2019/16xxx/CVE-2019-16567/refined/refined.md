Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16567:

**CVE-2019-16567**

*   **Vulnerability:** Insecure credential ID enumeration
*   **Affected Plugin:** Team Concert Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.3.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The Team Concert Plugin allows users to select credentials from a list when configuring the plugin. This functionality lacks proper permission checks.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission check on the method that provides the list of applicable credential IDs.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Overall/Read permission can obtain a list of valid credential IDs. These IDs can then be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-16565) to capture the credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user with Overall/Read permission can access the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance. This allows them to access configuration options of the plugin and enumerate valid credential IDs.

**Summary of the Vulnerability**
The Team Concert Plugin does not properly restrict access to a function that lists available credential IDs. This allows any user with Overall/Read access to enumerate these IDs which can then be used to potentially obtain the credential themselves using other vulnerabilities. This does not directly allow an attacker to access the credentials, but it does enable an attack by exposing the credential identifiers that an attacker would need.
