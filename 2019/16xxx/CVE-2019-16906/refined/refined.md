Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16906:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing authentication/authorization check within the "In-App & Desktop Notification for Jira" plugin. Specifically, the plugin allows retrieval of user notifications through a specific endpoint without verifying if the requestor is authorized to view those notifications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The plugin fails to enforce proper authentication before displaying notification data.
*   **Authorization Bypass:**  It does not check if the user making the request is actually authorized to view notifications for a specific user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read notifications for arbitrary users by simply knowing their username.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** User notification data is exposed.
*   **Notification Removal:**  The advisory states, "This notification is then no longer displayed to the normal user." This implies that when an attacker accesses notifications this way, it potentially removes these notifications from the intended user's view.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP request to the specified endpoint: `/plugins/servlet/nfj/PushNotification?username=`. The attacker needs to know the valid username of a Jira user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Jira instance.
*   **Jira Username:**  The attacker needs to know a valid Jira username to exploit the vulnerability. No password or other credentials are required to exploit this flaw.
