  "CVE-2019-16995": {
    "Description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.0.3, a memory leak exits in hsr_dev_finalize() in net/hsr/hsr_device.c if hsr_add_port fails to add a port, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-6caabe7f197d.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory leak in the `hsr_dev_finalize` function when `hsr_add_port` fails. The function does not properly free allocated memory when the port is not added successfully.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory leak",
      "Incomplete resource cleanup"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS). The memory leak can eventually exhaust system resources, leading to a crash or instability.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploiting the memory leak occurs through the network subsystem by calling `hsr_add_port` in `hsr_dev_finalize`, where the failure to add port is triggered, leading to the memory leak. This can be triggered by a series of network operations to setup a hsr interface which fail during add_port.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create network interfaces, specifically HSR interfaces, and trigger a failure in the `hsr_add_port` function, through a malicious network configuration."

   "CVE-2019-18805": {
        "Description": "An issue was discovered in net/ipv4/sysctl\\_net\\_ipv4.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.11. There is a net/ipv4/tcp\\_input.c signed integer overflow in tcp\\_ack\\_update\\_rtt() when userspace writes a very large integer to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp\\_min\\_rtt\\_wlen, leading to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact, aka CID-19fad20d15a6.",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Signed integer overflow in `tcp_ack_update_rtt()` within `tcp_input.c` when a very large integer is written to `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_min_rtt_wlen`. This write is processed by the `sysctl_net_ipv4.c` file.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Signed integer overflow",
           "Unchecked user input"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (DoS) or unspecified other impact. The overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, potentially crashing the system or causing other undefined errors.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by writing a large integer to the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_min_rtt_wlen` sysctl.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to write to the mentioned sysctl, requiring high privileges on the system."

        "Description": "drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/trans.c in the Linux kernel 5.2.14 does not check the alloc_workqueue return value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `alloc_workqueue` function's return value is not checked in `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/trans.c`. If it fails, then the resulting NULL pointer will be dereferenced.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "NULL pointer dereference",
            "Missing error check",
            "Incomplete resource allocation"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "Availability impact, specifically a denial-of-service due to a null pointer dereference. The system may crash or become unstable when attempting to use the related functionality.",
        "Attack vectors": "This vulnerability is triggered by a failure to allocate a workqueue in the specified driver. While not directly triggered by user input, an attacker who can cause resource exhaustion might be able to trigger this failure.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger the driver and cause a failure in the allocation of a workqueue, which would require a local access to the system. The attacker needs to perform operations that load the driver and cause it to fail memory allocation."

      "CVE-2019-17666":{
        "Description": "rtl_p2p_noa_ie in drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/ps.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.6 lacks a certain upper-bound check, leading to a buffer overflow.",
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `rtl_p2p_noa_ie` function lacks an upper-bound check, leading to a buffer overflow in the `ps.c` driver. This occurs when handling a P2P NoA (Wi-Fi Peer-to-Peer Notice of Absence) information element.",

       "Attack vectors": "An attacker within radio range can send a malformed Wi-Fi P2P NoA element to trigger the overflow.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be within the range of the affected Wi-Fi device to send the crafted P2P NoA information element that will exploit the missing upper-bound check."
