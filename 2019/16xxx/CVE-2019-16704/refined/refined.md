  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into editable fields.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into editable fields within the application's administrative interface (e.g., the 'title' field in the `infoclass_update.php` page).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged into the administrative interface using an ADMIN account to access the vulnerable pages and input fields."
