  "CVE-2019-16128": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `atcab_sign_base` function of the `cryptoauthlib` library. This function uses `memcpy` to copy data received from a cryptographic co-processor into a buffer. The size of the data to be copied is determined by a value in the received packet (`packet.data[ATCA_COUNT_IDX]`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')",
      "The size of the memcpy operation is determined by a value controlled by an attacker"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a buffer overflow on the microcontroller by injecting a malicious packet with a value in `packet.data[ATCA_COUNT_IDX]` which is greater than the buffer size, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, corruption of important variables, hijacking of the execution flow, or information disclosure from stack/heap.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the device is required to inject malicious packets onto the communication bus between the microcontroller and the cryptographic co-processor."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to inject arbitrary data onto the communication bus between the microcontroller and the cryptographic co-processor"
    ],
    "details": "The atcab_sign_base function copies data from the packet received from the cryptographic co-processor to a buffer on the microcontroller using memcpy. The size parameter of memcpy is taken from the received packet itself. If the count value is greater than 67, a buffer overflow will occur. A value greater than 195 also causes uninitialized data to be copied. This can allow an attacker to corrupt critical variables, hijack execution flow, or disclose stack/heap information."
