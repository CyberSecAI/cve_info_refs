Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-16548:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Google Compute Engine Plugin did not require POST requests on an API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
CSRF vulnerability. The plugin's API endpoint was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to provision new agents within the Google Compute Engine environment managed by the Jenkins plugin. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion or other malicious activities using the compromised agents.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request, likely initiated from a different web domain than the Jenkins instance, which leverages the fact that the API endpoint does not require a POST request, bypassing CSRF protection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim user (with necessary permissions in Jenkins/Google Compute Engine environment) to initiate the malicious request by visiting a website controlled by the attacker or by other means, such as sending a malicious link to the user. No specific user privilege is required for the actual attack but the victim user needs to have the required privileges to provision new agents.
