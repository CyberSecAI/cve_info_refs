[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-8jhx-9gf4-hhf5)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-8jhx-9gf4-hhf5/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

consul
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 1.0.3

## Patched versions

1.0.3

## Description

With the consul ruby gem before 1.0.3, if a controller checks multiple powers using `:if` or `:except` conditions, these conditions are erroneously applied to all power checks in that controller. This can lead to skipped power checks and hence unauthenticated access to certain controller actions.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Security vulnerability: Multiple powers in one controller are not always checked correctly #49

## Description

![@kratob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115590?v=4&size=48)[kratob](https://github.com/kratob)opened [on Sep 23, 2019](https://github.com/makandra/consul/issues/49#issue-496993277)

We have identified a security issue in consul. When a controller has multiple power directives, the :only and :except options of the last directive is applied to all directives. This can lead to unauthenticated access to certain controller actions.

Affected versions: <= 1.0.2

Fixed versions: 1.0.3

Affected code looks like this:

```
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  power :foo
  power :bar, only: :index

  ...
end
```

In this example both the powers :foo and :bar are only checked for the #index action. Other actions were left unprotected by powers checks.

Controllers with a single power directive are unaffected. Controllers where neither power uses :only or :except options are unaffected.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2019-16377](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8jhx-9gf4-hhf5 "CVE-2019-16377").
