CVE-2019-16731:
  - Description: The Skymee Petalk AI and Petwant PF-103 run a UDP server on 0.0.0.0:9003 called udpServerSys. It links a shared library called libcommon.so to provide a custom binary protocol that requires no authentication. Remote attackers can use functionality in these handlers if port 9003 is exposed.
  - Root cause: The udpServerSys service does not require authentication.
  - Weakness: Missing authentication for the udpServerSys service, which exposes device settings modification functionality.
  - Impact: Remote attackers can modify device settings without authentication, potentially leading to further exploitation.
  - Attack vector: Sending crafted UDP packets to port 9003 on the device.
  - Required attacker capabilities: Network access to port 9003 of the device.
