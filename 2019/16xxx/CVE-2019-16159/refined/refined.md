  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The BGP daemon's support for RFC 8203 administrative shutdown communication messages included an incorrect logical expression when checking the validity of an input message. Specifically, the check for message length was flawed, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow: A fixed-size buffer on the stack (`argbuf`) is overflowed when processing a crafted RFC 8203 shutdown message due to incorrect length validation and the use of `bsprintf` without proper bounds checking. ",
        "Uninitialized memory leak: When a shutdown message has a declared length greater than the actual message length in the packet, uninitialized memory is copied into the log due to a flaw in the length check logic.",
          "Insufficient Input Validation: The BIRD daemon did not properly validate the message length field of the RFC 8203 messages"
      ],
      "impact": "A four-byte stack-based buffer overflow occurs, where two of the overflow bytes are attacker-controlled and two are fixed. This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. Additionally, uninitialized stack memory can be leaked into the logs, possibly exposing sensitive information. In practice the overflow does not necessarily crash the process when built with normal settings.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted BGP notification message with an administrative shutdown communication to a BIRD instance. The vulnerable code is located within the `bgp_log_error` function, called upon receiving a BGP notification packet with type `0x03 (PKT_NOTIFICATION)`, major error code `0x06 (Cease)`, and minor error codes `0x02` or `0x04` (Administrative Shutdown or Administrative Reset)",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a BGP peer connection with the target BIRD instance and send a malicious BGP notification message. No authentication or prior access is required.",
        "additional_information":"The original implementation of RFC 8203 limited the message length to 128 bytes.  An update to RFC 8203 (RFC 8203-bis) updated the length field description to allow any value. BIRD's check `msg_len > 255` intended to account for this larger message length but failed to take the `bsprintf` format specifier into account. This caused the overflow to become possible when the maximum message length was changed to 255. The vulnerability exists in BIRD versions 1.6.4 and later."
