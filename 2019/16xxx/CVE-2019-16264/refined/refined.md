- Specifically, the "username" parameter sent via a POST request is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the login form of the vulnerable web application.
- They need to be able to send crafted POST requests with malicious SQL payloads within the "username" parameter.
- No specific authentication is required to attempt the attack on the login page.
