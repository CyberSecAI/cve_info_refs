- **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read in `parse_char_class()` function.
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs when Onigmo attempts to parse a regular expression with a large hexadecimal character escape sequence (e.g., `[{\x{111111}x`). The `parse_char_class()` function reads beyond the allocated buffer when processing this malformed character class.
- **Attack Vector:** Crafting a regular expression with a specific type of malformed character class, specifically one containing a large hexadecimal escape sequence within a character class.
- **Impact:** Segmentation fault due to out-of-bounds read.
- **Affected Function:** `parse_char_class()` in `regparse.c`.
