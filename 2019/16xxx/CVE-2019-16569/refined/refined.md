### Vulnerability Summary:
The Mantis Plugin 0.26 and earlier has a CSRF vulnerability.

### Root Cause:
The connection test method in the Mantis Plugin does not require POST requests.

### Weakness:
The plugin's connection test method lacks CSRF protection.

### Impact:
Attackers can trick Jenkins into connecting to Mantis-related paths on an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials.

### Attack Vector:
An attacker can craft a malicious web page that triggers the connection test method in the Mantis Plugin. Because the connection test method doesn't require a POST request, the attacker can trigger the request without the user's knowledge or consent if they are logged into Jenkins.

### Required Capabilities:
The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page and trick a logged-in Jenkins user into visiting it.
