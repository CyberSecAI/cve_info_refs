## Description

![@carlcj](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12987046?u=aae82b9e3069f88543d9884644e05bfe3c6ebe36&v=4&size=48)[carlcj](https://github.com/carlcj)opened [on Aug 4, 2019](https://github.com/GilaCMS/gila/issues/33#issue-476520685)

Hello Team,

When I'm using the application, I observed that application is vulnerable to LFI(Local File Inclusion) vulnerability. an only authenticated user can perform this exploit remotely.

**Step to reproduce the Vulnerability**

Login into the application as an admin user or equivalent user and go the below link

`http://localhost/gilacms/admin/fm/?f=src../../../../../../../../../WINDOWS/system32/drivers/etc/hosts`

[![gilacms lfi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12987046/62420430-e8a26680-b6af-11e9-9d56-bf0c437a3449.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12987046/62420430-e8a26680-b6af-11e9-9d56-bf0c437a3449.png)

#################################################################

**To fix the Vulnerability**

* If possible, do not permit appending file paths directly. Make them hard-coded or selectable from a limited hard-coded path list via an index variable.
* If you definitely need dynamic path concatenation, ensure you only accept required characters such as "a-Z0-9" and do not allow ".." or "/" or "%00" (null byte) or any other similar unexpected characters.
* It is important to limit the API to allow inclusion only from a directory and directories below it. This way you can ensure any potential attack cannot perform a directory traversal attack.

Tested on Windows 10

XAMPP version: v3.2.2

Gila CMS Version: 1.10.9
