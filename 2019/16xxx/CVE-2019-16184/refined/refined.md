    *   **Attack Vector:** Man in the middle attacks.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be positioned in between the user and server to intercept communication.
*   **Path revelation:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Information disclosure through path revelation.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could gather information about the server's file structure, which could aid in further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Potentially through error messages or other information leakage.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to trigger the information leakage, often through specific input.
*   **LDAP login non-generic login message:**
    *   **Weakness:** The login messages specific to LDAP could leak information about the system configuration

    *   **Attack Vector:** Through analyzing error messages
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need to try to log in to the application.
*  **Equation signs are not masked by default on data export:**
    *   **Weakness:** Equation signs not properly escaped during data export
    *   **Impact:**  Could potentially lead to formula injection vulnerabilities in exported data, if that data is further processed in a spreadsheet program.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating exported data.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker could potentially modify exported data.
*   **CSRF cookie missing HTTP only parameter:**
    *   **Weakness:**  CSRF cookie not marked as HttpOnly

    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have admin access with limited permissions.
*  **Admin user can mark other user notification as read:**
     *  **Weakness:** Improper access control.
     *  **Impact:** An admin user can mark notifications as read for other users.
     *  **Attack Vector:** Accessing the notification functionality.
     *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have admin access.
*   **Database backup uses browser cache:**
    *  **Weakness:** Caching of sensitive data in the browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Sensitive backup data could be unintentionally exposed through the browser cache.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Retrieving data from browser cache.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to access the user's browser cache.
*   **Browser cache used for exports:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Caching of sensitive data in the browser
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive export data could be unintentionally exposed through the browser cache.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Retrieving data from browser cache.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to access the user's browser cache.
*   **Stored XSS vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
