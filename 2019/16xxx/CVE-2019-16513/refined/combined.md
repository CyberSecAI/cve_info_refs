Your businessâ security is only as strong as its weakest link, and more often than not, that weakest link is actually your people. According to Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, 74% of all data breaches involved peopleâregular, well-meaning users, who accidentally clicked on a malicious link, inadvertently shared a password, or fell victim to social engineering.

# ConnectWise Control 'Attack Chain' Exploit: 20 Questions For Security Researcher Bishop Fox

"One of our security researchers found these vulnerabilities. He deemed them severe enough to rate them as critical and the attack chain so bad that we had to report them."

![](./media_1e3051ddfa5d6c6b707313e709100d607cefde94e.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

Security consultancy Bishop Fox has discovered eight vulnerabilities in [ConnectWise Control](/news/managed-services/connectwise-control-msp-security-vulnerabilities-are-severe-bishop-fox).

“One of our security researchers found these vulnerabilities. He deemed them severe enough to rate them as critical, and the attack chain so bad that we had to report them,” said [Bishop Fox](https://know.bishopfox.com/advisories/connectwise-control) Associate Vice President of Consulting Daniel Wood.

ConnectWise was tied to numerous security breaches in 2019, starting with reports in April that the company’s [Control product was used in the now-infamous Wipro hack](/news/security/product-exec-wipro-breach-appears-to-be-legitimate-use-of-connectwise-control). Then an MSP using ConnectWise Control had its network hacked in August, resulting in the compromise of [22 municipal web sites in cities and towns across Texas](/news/security/connectwise-tool-used-as-entry-point-in-texas-ransomware-attack).

ConnectWise told CRN Tuesday that while it “struggled” to reproduce the flaws, it has patched 75-percent of them.

Here, Wood answers 20 questions about how Bishop Fox discovered the vulnerabilities and the response it received from ConnectWise.

**Why did you look at ConnectWise Control?**

It's actually not the most interesting part of the story, but essentially our security researcher, Matt Hamilton [who has since left the company], he was looking into using the product himself for some personal purposes, for his family, for remote IT troubleshooting, so he can help his family out when they needed it, similar to LogMeIn.
So, you know, being a security researcher the first thing you do when you think about remote management tools and software is, ‘How secure is it?’ So he just started to take a look at it, to make sure that before he started using it personally, that it wasn't super vulnerable or had a lot of issues with it. So he just started conducting the research on his own to make sure, again, that it was secure before using. So that's kind of why we started looking at.
**What was it you found?**

The kind of things that we found are commonplace to what you would see with a web application or a web service, whether it’s cross-site scripting or cross-site request forgery (CSRF}. A lot of web applications and services have those vulnerabilities.
The run of the mill kind of vulnerabilities that you would expect on any application or service that doesn’t have security taken into serious consideration during the development life cycle of it is basically what was discovered.

This is more of a general statement, but when companies take on other technologies or acquire other companies for their technology and use a lot of third-party dependencies, a lot of the time they'll get a lot of tech debt with it. That tech debt will result in vulnerabilities. So if this was more of a legacy application that they just gave a facelift to then, they probably inherited the vulnerabilities.

**Specifically, what were the flaws that you discovered?**

The flaws in general, they’re serious in their own right, but when you start taking a look at chaining the vulnerabilities together -- we call them basically attack chaining. There are pretty much two, big sub-optimal outcomes that can occur here: you have code execution on the actual Control server by leveraging the cross-site scripting and the cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities, which then allows you to execute arbitrary code execution on that Control server. That’s for the SaaS service, when you are talking about cloud. Then you are looking at what could an attacker access after having, basically, arbitrary code execution on that Control server. In this case, it could be access to things like [Amazon Web Services] S3 buckets or EC2 instances, or anything else that the Control server may give you access to.

The other avenue of attack could be on the actual client desktop, where the application is installed, where if an attacker were to create a JavaScript payload that exploits the lack of CSRF protection, they can then start to execute code within the context of that web browser, and at that point as soon as the malicious JavaScript starts to execute within the web browser it starts to exploit that cross-site scripting vulnerability.

From that point, if you don’t have cross-site forgery protection, or if CORS is misconfigured on the server, basically it gives you a connection to the client desktop that the software is installed upon. So if you were to install it on your desktop and somehow you were able to go to a website that had malicious JavaScript, like a drive-by download, at this point if it was known that you had this software installed on your end point, it would execute in the context of your browser and could exploit your personal computer if it was installed on it.

You wouldn’t need to have initial access on the endpoint itself as long as someone who has the Control server installed were to browse a malicious website, the JavaScript could execute in that browser and start sending all those requests to the Control server API on basically, your client. At that point its able to pull out the information it needs from the API, then would provide you access to the endpoint itself.

**What was ConnectWise's response?**

When we first reported the vulnerability [to ConnectWise] we had radio silence. We gave it a day or two and then at the same time I requested our team get CVE [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures] numbers assigned so we could officially track the vulnerabilities from MITRE and at that point decided to reach out to their help support, or help desk, and we provided them the disclosure of the vulnerabilities as well as the CVE numbers and basically offered to help them understand the vulnerabilities that we had reported. At that time, that’s when they replied back and wanted to have a conversation with us.

**Was this part of a sales pitch by Bishop Fox to try to get ConnectWise to use your services?**

No. Absolutely not.

**So you weren’t saying ‘For $50,000 or $100,000 we can make this all go away?’**

We did not have that conversation at all. It was literally: One of our security researchers found these vulnerabilities. He deemed them severe enough to rate them as critical and the attack chain so bad that we had to report them.

When [Hamilton] was doing his research, he was searching more about the company to better understand the impact, and that’s when he came upon [*CRN*'s] previous reporting about the Texas Ransomware incident and how it could be connected. So that piqued our interest. There was an active ransomware incident ongoing. We found vulnerabilities that could be potentially involved in this sort of incident. That’s when we decided to kick our game up a notch and make sure we were working with ConnectWise, the vendor, so they could understand the vulnerabilities, but also I ended up making the decision to contact authorities as well, to provide any support that maybe needed there as well.

![](./media_1b8543c9624abbfc909adb3b44eb0ba3988b442be.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

**So you began a conversation with the FBI field office investigating the Texas ransomware outbreak. Did you talk to them and explain what you found?**

We talked with them and walked them through the vulnerabilities. We had multiple conversations, I would say, maybe over a month or two.

**Can you tell me about the conversations you had with ConnectWise?**

So the initial conversation occurred with the team, [former ConnectWise CISO] John Ford, [Bishop Fox's] Matt Hamilton, and some other people on the vendor side. They were all part of the conversation. Then after they responded back to the ticket, I believe we had a phone conversation with them the next day. Then we had one or two follow-up meetings over the span of that week, essentially where we went back and forth helping them understand the vulnerabilities. They had questions. They were working to reproduce some of the vulnerabilities and confirming whether they existed or not. One of the vulnerabilities they weren’t able to reproduce. We had our final point of contact with them at that time.

![](./media_1a3f524064d0972a93e1905b91e167561d076d480.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

**How did that end? Did you leave satisfied that they were making plans to fix the security vulnerabilities that you found?**

I don’t know if we were satisfied with that conversation. The conversation turned a little contentious. A threat of defamation and libel did come up in that conversation. That immediately concerned us. I personally engaged John Ford (pictured) to try to get a meeting set up. We waffled back and forth. Between the end of September and the beginning of December I tried to get a meeting with [Ford] and we were missing each other. I reached out to him a couple more times after that, but I ceased emailing him after three or four times without a response. [*Note: Ford left ConnectWise in December and took a new role at security vendor IronNet Cybersecurity in January.*]

**So what made you feel comfortable coming out and publicizing the Zero Day vulnerabilities after the threat of litigation?**

There are two things. First and foremost, at Bishop Fox we absolutely stand behind the researchers we have and support them. As long as they follow our policies and procedures, and we do things by the book, then we’re always going to support them and stand up for them. If someone is threatening litigation, that’s only going to make us double down on protecting our researchers, consultants, and our company. The other thing is we’re not doing anything that’s unique in the industry. We actually follow a vulnerability disclosure policy that is industry standard, where we try to work with the vendors, and its very similar to the Google disclosure policy that a lot of different companies follow.

We believe in responsible disclosure. We’re not going to drop Zero Day’s all over the place. We are going to work with affected vendors, make sure things are fixed.

If it becomes egregious, the vulnerability’s impact and severity could override not disclosing a vulnerability. We want to make sure we are helping to protect the public that could be using this product that could be vulnerable to the issues that we outlined.

![](./media_1e176229e0a29a0a3d4f14d415a87cdd7afe5bf74.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

**After that threat of litigation, did you go over the work again and just make sure that you were correct?**

Yeah. Absolutely. So as soon as this occurred and that was relayed to me, I immediately rounded the wagons on our side and made sure that we were covered from a legal perspective and did 20 passes over the research that [Hamilton] had written up and discovered to make sure that everything we were saying was factual, and we truly understood the problem.

**Is this something you do frequently?**

It's becoming more frequent. [At] Bishop Fox, our mission is to become the best offensive security firm in the universe. That’s kind of our internal mantra. A lot of that revolves around the security research that we do. We have started to discover more and more vulnerabilities and we’re releasing them through our responsible disclosure policy more frequently.

![](./media_14061567416e11214caa98e75dcd4eb1026a81eb5.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

**Are these difficult vulnerabilities to fix?**
No, not at all. I mean, they're kind of like the basic web service and web applications vulnerabilities that you typically see in web applications. There's definitely going to be involvement from ConnectWise to fix those.

I know it was brought up about enabling multifactor or two-factor authentication, that it would potentially address it. It absolutely would do nothing to mitigate any of the vulnerabilities because with cross-site scripting and cross-site forgery, you're going to be riding the session of the victim or the user, so at that point, they're already basically authenticated. So that's not going to mitigate any of the vulnerabilities.
There are a couple things that could. There are some kinds of "hacky things" that could be done, as well, like making sure that the Control server doesn't have Flash installed on the ConnectWise Control Web Server and some other things. It's not too complicated.

**Is there any way a user or an MSP could patch this without ConnectWise’s help?**

No. By its nature, they wouldn’t be able to patch the vulnerability itself, nor would they be able to mitigate it.

![](./media_10dcd7908f637edfca2a28a15e9c9cfbca484b293.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

**What is typically the response you get from companies when you find a vulnerability in their product?**

Typically, the response is pretty positive. Companies don’t want to be in the news, and companies don’t want to expose their clients to vulnerabilities. Typically, we’ll see them want to understand the issues and then proactively work to address the vulnerabilities and put a patch out, within a relatively short time frame.

And then there are also companies like Amazon—Amazon Web Services— where they were actively seeking to understand the issue and then seeking almost a partnership to better understand the research that we do in the future to make sure that they're protecting their customers going forward.

So there's the run of the mill, ‘Thanks, but no thanks’ all the way up to active partnerships. This is one of the rare ones where a company will become almost adversarial in nature.

![](./media_11b7e6e1619f225ccb197c65c1c21f46b3f1846ff.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

**Has anyone looked to see if ConnectWise took this to heart and fixed what you found since you last talked?**

If you had asked that question two months ago, the answer would have been yes. But after not seeing the vulnerability patching happening, we decided it wasn’t the best use of time to keep giving ConnectWise a free pen test over and over, if they weren’t addressing the issues.

**Have you looked at other RMM tools to get a baseline, or to see if they are just as flawed, or less flawed?**

Yes. That’s basically as far as I’ll expand on that. Yes, we have.

**Are they all dangerous?**

It's hard to generalize. If done incorrectly, not just the programming of the architecture of the application, but also the configuration. If that's done incorrectly then yes, you can expose yourself to a whole bunch of different security concerns with remote access.

You’re essentially opening the attack surface of whatever endpoint you install the software on because it's literally saying ‘Hey, I want to offer remote administration to this endpoint,’ and so now you're trusting the authorization model of the software, as well as just how secure it's been designed or configured to prevent anyone else who does not have authorization to connect to it. You’re taking a risk by using RMMs because you’re basically knowingly increasing that attack surface, hoping that the software actually has done this due diligence.

![](./media_1c34db53b266d6329e174b5c7e0f4c312ad0eac7b.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

**Are the other RMM tools that you guys have looked at equally flawed?**
I can’t make an assertion in that way because I haven't looked at all the different RMM tools that we have assessed to kind of do apples-to-apples. I could make a statement that, for a commercial tool, the vulnerabilities that exist in it, you would expect them not to exist in a commercial tool of this caliber.
**Is that a reference to the ConnectWise product or all RMM products?**

The ConnectWise product. A lot of the time these developers are not security developers or security-conscious developers or even have security professionals in their organization. So they open up that attack surface and they don't really understand the risks of doing so. So, going back to RMMs, usually what you'll find are these types of vulnerabilities in them.

# ConnectWise Control MSP Security Vulnerabilities Are ‘Severe:’ Bishop Fox

Exploiting the vulnerabilities “would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim’s Control server, as well as gain control of any client machines connected to a victim’s Control instance,” said security researchers from Bishop Fox.

![ARTICLE TITLE HERE](./media_1281d5cedf1358dec834f372852a6d192c45422fe.jpeg?width=750&format=jpeg&optimize=medium)

[Using multiple security flaws in ConnectWise Control](/slide-shows/managed-services/connectwise-control-attack-chain-exploit-20-questions-for-security-researcher-bishop-fox), hackers could create an “attack chain” that gives cyber-criminals the ability to hijack an MSP’s systems as well as their customers’ devices, security consultant Bishop Fox [plans to announce Wednesday](https://know.bishopfox.com/advisories/connectwise-control).

“One of our security researchers found these vulnerabilities. He deemed them severe enough to rate them as critical, and the attack chain so bad that we had to report them,” Bishop Fox Associate Vice President of Consulting Daniel Wood told CRN.

Chaining the vulnerabilities “would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim’s Control server, as well as gain control of any client machines connected to a victim’s Control instance,” according to a post from Bishop Fox on what it calls the ConnectWise Critical (Zero-Day) Vulnerability Disclosure.

**[RELATED: [ConnectWise Control Used As Entry Point In Texas Ransomware Attack](/news/security/connectwise-tool-used-as-entry-point-in-texas-ransomware-attack)]**

The eight flaws named by Bishop Fox are: cross-site scripting, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) misconfiguration, cross-site request forgery, information disclosure, remote code execution, user enumeration, missing security headers and insecure cookie scope.

“The flaws in general, they’re serious in their own right, but when you start taking a look at chaining the vulnerabilities together, [it’s even worse]. We call them basically attack chaining,” said Wood.

The “attack chaining” can result in either “forgery vulnerabilities” on the ConnectWise Control server or a client desktop breach that opens the door to the “endpoint” device itself, according to Bishop Fox, which bills itself as the largest private services firm focused on “offensive security testing.”

ConnectWise Control is among the most popular MSP tools, with at least 100,000 users managing millions of endpoints around the globe, according to ConnectWise.

Bishop Fox indicated that it is also looking for potential security flaws in other remote monitoring and management tools for MSPs. If RMM tools are not architected or configured properly, MSPs can expose themselves and their customers to a “whole bunch of different security concerns,” said Wood.

ConnectWise Director of Security Tom Greco Tuesday told CRN that ConnectWise’s engineers have patched 75 percent of the flaws that Bishop Fox identified, despite its difficulty in reproducing them.

“The vulnerabilities they reported to us didn’t really provide a proof of exploitation,” he said. “They provided conceptual ideas of how they might be exploited, but they wouldn’t or couldn’t provide us with any specific examples. That doesn’t mean we didn’t take them seriously. We certainly did.”

ConnectWise in a statement provided to CRN said that both it and Bishop Fox “agreed that no active exploits had occurred from these potential vulnerabilities.”

“ConnectWise takes the security of our products and our partners very seriously,” the company said in the statement. “We appreciated the insights and based on their report, we did our own internal research and evaluation and addressed the points they raised in their review. With an overabundance of caution, we resolved 6 of the 8 items Bishop Fox listed in their report by October 2, 2019.”

On January 21, 2020, ConnectWise said it again ran its own tests on “6 of the 8 items referenced in the Bishop Fox report and we can affirm that they are secure.”

“Within the next two weeks we will resolve a seventh item that is much lower in risk,” the company said. “ConnectWise takes the stance that the final item identified by Bishop Fox does not pose a credible threat to users of the product.”

At CRN’s request, independent researchers at Huntress Labs, a provider of managed breach detection for MSPs, examined Bishop Fox’s vulnerability report to see if it accurately characterized the flaws that it claims to have found.

“This is no-nonsense, high-quality offensive security research. The channel usually doesn’t get this type of exposure because the types of people like Bishop Fox are usually working for the largest companies in the world,” said Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of Huntress Labs. “These are real vulnerabilities, found by real vulnerability researchers and our community could use a lot more of it … This could have allowed a hacker to gain remote access if they targeted the right administrator. I would give it an 8 out of 10 on the severity rating.”

Hanslovan‘s team started Tuesday morning to see if they could recreate the exploits, and discovered that in some cases they could.

“We’ve definitely seen some of the vulnerabilities patched or neutered. So they’re not as dangerous. However, there are definitely some features that are also vulnerabilities that weren’t patched,” he said. “Whether that was a direct decision, we’re not sure. As for some of the other vulnerabilities, the CORS vulnerability, it appears that one is still exploitable. Additionally, we’re still in the final testing period of the remote code execution vulnerability. We’re unsure if that’s patched yet. We believe there are some of these vulnerabilities that haven’t been patched, but have been mitigated.”

“The CORS vulnerability. The cross-site scripting vulnerability, and the remote code execution vulnerability are all the scary ones,” Hanslovan said. “Those are the ones, if you look at the criticality, they’re rated medium to high, when it comes to how dangerous they are. We confirmed cross site scripting still exists, so we’re a little concerned about that. But the one that would really be bothersome, is if this remote code execution vulnerability is still there, which it seems likely it could still be there. That means there’s still some dragons lurking. There’s no way to sugar coat that. We’re excited that ConnectWise has clearly put effort into mitigate the low vulnerability ones which are all cleared up.”

For its part, ConnectWise said it fixed the cross-site forgery, information disclosure, user enumeration, CORS misconfiguration and insecure cookie scope vulnerabilities in September and October.

It also says it fixed the remote code execution vulnerability in September before Bishop Fox found it.

The company said it has not yet fixed the missing security headers and does not plan to fix the cross-site scripting, which it describes as a feature even though the two security research firms call it a flaw.

ConnectWise was tied to numerous MSP security breaches in 2019, starting with reports in April that the company’s Control product was used in the now-infamous Wipro hack. In May the company announced that its ConnectWise Manage platform was taken offline by European hackers. Then in August an MSP using ConnectWise Control had his network hit by ransomware that hit 22 municipal web sites in cities and towns across Texas.

Wood said many of the legacy apps Bishop Fox encounters are not built with security in mind, but cobbled together over years, through need and acquisitions, leaving layers of “tech debt.”

“That tech debt will result in vulnerabilities,” Wood said. “So if this was more of a legacy application that they kind of just gave a face-lift to then, they probably inherited the vulnerabilities.”

ConnectWise in fact acquired the Screen Connect product in 2015, which was later branded ConnectWise Control. Last year, the company celebrated ConnectWise Control’s tenth birthday on its website. In that write up, it said the product was designed from the ground up, in 2009. Screen Connect was originally a screen writing software website.

A Bishop Fox security researcher, who has since left the company, began investigating ConnectWise Control on September 13, Wood said. At that time, Bishop Fox was not aware of ConnectWise Control’s role in the Texas ransomware outbreak, but once it learned of it, the company reached out to the FBI field office handling the investigation to share the flaws it had discovered.

“We talked with them and walked them through the vulnerabilities,” Wood said. “We had multiple conversations. I would say maybe over a month or two.”

Wood said at some point during conversations, ConnectWise threatened the researchers with litigation.

“The conversation turned a little contentious,” said Wood. “A threat of defamation and libel did come up in that conversation. That immediately concerned us,” Wood said. “We absolutely stand behind the researchers we have and support them. As long as they follow our policies and procedures -- and we do things by the book -- then we’re always going to support them and stand up for them. If someone is threatening litigation, that’s only going to make us double down on protecting our researchers, consultants, and our company.”

The ConnectWise response was in sharp contrast to the handling of an Amazon Web Services flaw discovered by Bishop Fox, Wood said. Wood said AWS acted as a “partner” to resolve the security issue. “They were actively seeking to understand the issue and then seeking kind of almost a partnership to better understand the research that we do in the future to make sure they’re that they're protecting their customers going forward,” he said.

Greco, who was not involved in the initial conversations with Bishop Fox, said he could not comment on whether there was a threat of litigation by ConnectWise. He said he never worked for the former CISO, John Ford, who was part of those initial conversations with Bishop Fox and left ConnectWise in December.

Greco said MSPs should continue to have confidence in ConnectWise Control. “The testing that our code goes through, as well as our external assessments and vulnerability and penetration tests definitely gives us confidence that our products are secure,” he said. “And we’re always improving. As everybody knows, the game is never done. You have to continue to develop. You have to continue to look at our existing code and improve and get better at what we do. But yes, we are very confident in the security of our products.”

Finally, ConnectWise said it will continue to work to optimize security for its partners and the channel community. “We encourage partners and colleagues to contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cbb8aea8beb9a2bfb28ba8a4a5a5aea8bfbca2b8aee5a8a4a6) with any questions or to report any issues,” the company said.

## Introduction

> *Bishop Fox takes security seriously. In accordance with our* [*Vulnerability Disclosure Policy*](https://www.bishopfox.com/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/)*, we follow the industry-standard responsible disclosure process. At the expiration of this time window, we disclose discovered vulnerabilities in our* *Security Bulletins and Advisories**.*

Read the technical details below to see if you’re affected.

One of our security researchers, Matt Hamilton (a Bishop Fox alumnus) discovered several vulnerabilities while conducting research on the ConnectWise Control product, an application that allows remote administration of endpoints. As a part of our disclosure process, Bishop Fox proactively reached out to the vendor ConnectWise to help them understand the technical nature of the discovered vulnerabilities. During the research process, we read in news reports that ConnectWise products had been exploited in a ransomware attack in Texas. Without knowing whether the attack was facilitated by the vulnerabilities we discovered, Bishop Fox separately reached out to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the local Texas field office to provide details on the discovered vulnerabilities in case this information could be of use to the investigation into the ransomware incident.

Chaining the vulnerabilities as described below would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim’s Control server, as well as gain control of any client machines connected to a victim’s Control instance. What we discovered is consistent with the issues reported on by both [CRN](https://www.crn.com/news/security/connectwise-tool-used-as-entry-point-in-texas-ransomware-attack) and [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/connectwise-warns-of-ongoing-ransomware-attacks-targeting-its-customers/)—however, this is not proof that the vulnerabilities we discovered were used in the incident. What we *can* say is that nothing we have read about the Texas ransomware attack so far rules out the possibility that these vulnerabilities were involved.

For example, Bishop Fox determined that multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides no mitigation for any of the vulnerabilities that we discovered. This is consistent with a [reported](https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/msp-at-center-of-texas-ransomware-hit-we-take-care-of-our-customers-) statement by Rick Myers, the owner of the firm that provides MSP services to the affected sites, that “he is not sure if MFA would have made a difference in this case.” In the same article, CRN also reported:

> *Myers said he believes the attacks are being carried out on "several different levels" with an as-yet unidentified "issue" that is key to the Texas ransomware attack.*

If true, this statement would suggest that the attackers used an attack chain involving multiple vulnerabilities, beyond an unsophisticated brute-force attack. Furthermore, with a code execution vulnerability present, it would be possible for a sophisticated attacker to cover their tracks, which makes attribution extremely difficult.

In a follow-up meeting with the vendor on September 25, 2019, ConnectWise CISO John Ford asserted that the Bishop Fox findings did not affect on-premise solutions and stated that these vulnerabilities are not exploitable because ConnectWise was unable to reproduce them using the steps that Bishop Fox provided them. Additionally, Mr. Ford raised the threat of a defamation lawsuit. But Bishop Fox’s research found vulnerabilities that do, in fact, impact on-premise installations.

Bishop Fox stands by our security researchers and believes in a fair and transparent process. In this particular case, we extended the disclosure timeline to give ConnectWise additional time to address these issues. **ConnectWise has released** **multiple updates to the product since the initial discovery; however, the only vulnerability that appears to be addressed was the user enumeration vulnerability, and the [release notes](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Control_Documentation/Release_notes) make no mention of the other security issues identified.**

## Advisory Summary

The following describes identified vulnerabilities in the ConnectWise control , formerly known as ScreenConnect, version 19.3.25270.7185.

Using the vulnerabilities documented in this disclosure, it was possible to create an attack chain that begins with coercing a SaaS user to visit an attacker-controlled website and ends with the complete takeover of the victim's ConnectWise Control instance. This includes the ability to execute arbitrary code on the Control server as well as the ability to connect to any client machine connected to the victim's Control instance.\*Earlier versions are untested at the time of writing, but presumed to be vulnerable.

## Attack Chains

### Code Execution on Control Server

Using the vulnerabilities disclosed in this document, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's Control server using the steps outlined below:

1. An attacker can create a JavaScript payload that exploits the lack of CSRF protection to upload an extension containing malicious code to the visitor’s instance if the visitor is an administrator.
2. An attacker can load JavaScript into the victim's browser by coercing the victim to visit an attacker-controlled site or a SaaS instance under the attacker's control, exploiting the XSS vulnerability.
3. Once the payload is executed in the victim's browser, the attacker can use the uploaded extension to execute arbitrary code on the victim's Control instance.
4. An attacker able to arbitrary execute code on a SaaS Control server may have the ability to access any resources accessible to the instance itself such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, or other sensitive resources within the cloud environment that are accessible to the compromised server.

### Connection to Any Client's Desktop

It is possible for an attacker to gain control of any client machines connected to a victim's Control instance using the steps below:

1. An attacker can create a JavaScript payload that exploits the lack of CSRF protection, sending requests to endpoints on the visitor’s Control instance to collect the information necessary to build a client. This information includes a target client's session identifiers, Control instance public key, and signed tokens for the target identifiers.
2. An attacker could load the malicious JavaScript into the victim's browser by coercing the victim to visit an attacker-controlled site or a SaaS instance under the attacker's control, exploiting the XSS vulnerability.
3. Once the JavaScript is executed, it can exploit the lack of CSRF protection and CORS misconfiguration to gather information necessary and then construct a client connection.
4. Optionally, the attacker could use Control functionality to silently execute code on the target client(s).

## VULNERABILITIES

### Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The ConnectWise Control cloud and user instances do not implement CSRF protection. If a user visited a third-party website while authenticated to the Control application, script running on the malicious website would be able modify a user's Control account by sending API requests, without the knowledge of the victim Control user.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2019-16513](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16513) | Critical | Cross-site request forgery | Remote |

Neither the Control cloud service nor customer instance APIs include CSRF-prevention tokens. This is a crucial security control that, if implemented, would prevent JavaScript on other domains from sending mutable-data API requests on behalf of victim users.
The proof-of-concept JavaScript code below disables "suspicious account activity" email alerts. This attack is not mitigated due to the lack of CSRF prevention:

```
//
// Disable "suspicious account activity" emails
//
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.withCredentials = true;
request.open('POST', 'https://cloud.screenconnect.co...');
request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
request.send('[false, false, false, false]');
request.onload = function() {
console.log(this.response);
}

```

*FIGURE 1 - Proof-of-concept JavaScript code to disable "suspicious account activity" email notifications*

This issue impacts both the ConnectWise Control cloud server and customer Control servers.

### Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

The ConnectWise Control application is affected by a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Appearance modifier. The vulnerability allowed any malicious customer to execute arbitrary JavaScript in visitors’ browsers.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2019-16512](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16512) | High | Code execution | Remote |

Stored XSS was present in the Appearance modifier that allowed an administrator of a given Control instance to add arbitrary HTML to the login page, enabling the administrator to conduct an XSS attack on any users who visit the login page, as shown below:

![XSS payload in login message](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/200113%20ConnectWise%20Control%20-%20Responsible%20Disclosure%20-%20Fig%202-1.png)

FIGURE 2 - XSS payload in login message

![](https://know.bishopfox.com/hubfs/190925-connectwise-body-image-screenshot-2-CROPPED.png)

FIGURE 3 - XSS payload on login page

Once this payload is added, anyone who visits the login page will execute the attacker-controlled JavaScript payload.
Only the `LoginPanel.LoginReason.None.Message` field was tested for XSS, as it was one of the few fields accessible on an unauthenticated page. It is likely there are other fields that are equally vulnerable.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration

Both the ConnectWise Control cloud and customer instances were affected by a CORS misconfiguration, which reflected the `Origin` provided by incoming requests. This allowed JavaScript running on any domain to interact with both the Control cloud and customer Control server APIs and perform administrative actions, such as signing session identifiers, without the victim’s knowledge.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2019-16517](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16517) | High | Same-origin policy bypass | Remote, Context dependent |

**Request**

```
POST /Service/GetProfileInfo HTTP/1.1
Host: cloud.screenconnect.com
Origin: https://bishopfox.com
```

**Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Expires: -1
Server: Control Server
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://bishopfox.com
```

This issue impacts both the ConnectWise Control cloud server and customer instances.

This vulnerability enables any site, regardless of the origin, to send requests to the Control API and read the resulting response.

---

## Remote Code Execution

The ConnectWise Control server is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability. Administrative users could upload unsigned extension ZIP file containing executable code that is subsequently executed by the server.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2019-16514](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16514) | High | Code execution | Remote |

**Request**

```
POST /Services/ExtensionService.ashx/InstallExtension HTTP/1.1
Host: bishopfox.screenconnect.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 1904
Origin: https://bishopfox.screenconnect.com
Connection: close
Cookie: CloudAuth=ug[REDACTED]A

[“UEsDBA…omitted for brevity…AAA==”]
```

**Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Length: 38
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://bishopfox.screenconnect.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Connection: close

“7f322b7b-d86c-4bc2-a6a6-111111111111"
```

When an extension is uploaded, even if the contents are not signed, they are accessible using forced browsing and can be executed on the server. An attacker could navigate to the URL below, and the `ArbitraryCode.ashx` file in the extension's ZIP would be executed by the server despite not being signed:

```
https://bishopfox.screenconnect.com/App_Extensions/7f322b7b-d86c-4bc2-a6a6-111111111111</span>/ArbitraryCode.ashx
```

***FIGURE 4** - Uploaded extension executes arbitrary code when accessed directly*

An attacker able to arbitrary execute code on a SaaS Control server may have the ability to access any resources accessible to the instance itself such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, or other sensitive resources within the cloud environment that are accessible to the compromised server.

---

## Information Disclosure

The ConnectWise Control cloud service is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to reveal the administrator email address and postal code of an arbitrary customer Control instance.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not assigned | Medium | Information disclosure | Remote |

**Request**

```
POST /scripts/Service/GetScripts HTTP/1.1
Host: cloud.screenconnect.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 25
Connection: close

[{“InstanceID":"a1q2qz"}]
```

**Response**

```
…omitted for brevity…
“codeContext":{"accountId":"urnce4","accountAttributes":248,"remainingEvaluationDays":11.0000,"accountCreationDate":"\/Date(1568488200000)\/","emailAddress":"[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)","country":"United States”,"postalCode":"94111","state":null,"orgType":"Other","instanceId":"a1q2qz","instanceAttributes":0,"currentLicenseType":"EVALUATION_ACCESS_PLUS-1903","currentLicenseCount":3,"regionId":"us4"}}]
```

This vulnerability is present only on the ConnectWise Control cloud server and does not affect self-hosted instances.

---

## User Enumeration

ConnectWise Control is vulnerable to a user enumeration vulnerability, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to determine with certainty if an account exists for a given username.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2019-16516](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16516) | Low | Information disclosure | Remote |

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Content-Length: 79247
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
P3P: CP="NON CUR OUR STP STA PRE"
X-Login-Result: UserNameInvalid
```

***FIGURE 5** - Response to login request from nonexistent user*

When a user attempts to log in as an account that does exist, but with an incorrect password, the `PasswordInvalid` header value is returned.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Content-Length: 97237
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
P3P: CP="NON CUR OUR STP STA PRE"
X-Login-Result: PasswordInvalid
```

***FIGURE 6** - Response of login request from existing user*

By brute-forcing usernames and inspecting the response, an attacker can create a list of target accounts that are known to exist.

---

## Missing Security Headers

The ConnectWise Control application does not implement modern HTTP security headers, which is a missed opportunity to implement optional security features in browsers.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2019-16515](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16515) | Low | Security headers | Remote |

The following security headers are not implemented in the Control application:

* `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`
* `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`

This issue impacts both the ConnectWise Control cloud server and customer instances.

---

## Insecure Cookie Scope

The ConnectWise Control authentication cookie, `CloudAuth`, is scoped to the parent domain,  `screenconnect.com`. When a user visits a Control instance owned by a malicious SaaS customer, the user's `CloudAuth` token would be sent to the malicious user's SaaS instance.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Not assigned | Low | Other | Remote |

Sending the `CloudAuth` token to all `screenconnect.com` subdomains may be viewed as an acceptable risk, as all machines running under that domain are operated by ConnectWise. However, in the event that a malicious SaaS user gains code execution (like the one documented in this disclosure) or is otherwise able to read the content of incoming requests, the malicious user could take over the sessions of other visiting SaaS customers.
