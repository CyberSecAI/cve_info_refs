## Description

![@sneak](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408977?v=4&size=48)[sneak](https://github.com/sneak)opened [on Sep 29, 2019](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3583#issue-499970672)

<https://sneak.berlin/20190929/keybase-backdoor/>

I don't want XLM shitcoins. I don't want anyone to send me XLM shitcoins thinking I want them. I don't hold any private keys for XLM shitcoins, despite what [my keybase profile](https://keybase.io/sneak) now fraudulently claims.

Somehow, on the 4th of February, [an attestation](https://keybase.io/sneak/sigchain#289375141b43421b024be60b0569cd701061fd37ca14f047e5d96a1bf8dacefe22) has found its way onto my profile, signed by one of my devices by the Keybase iOS client (keybase.io go client 2.13.2). I did not want this signature generated with my keys. Indeed, it happened without my knowledge or consent.

I am unable to revoke this from my keybase profile.

   Jeffrey Paul: Keybase iOS Has A Backdoor

![](https://t.sneak.cloud/js/?idsite=1&rec=1)

# [Jeffrey¬†Paul](/)

# Keybase iOS Has A Backdoor 29 September 2019 ( 546 words, approximately 3 minutes reading time. )

Keybase‚Äôs iOS client has received a backdoor.

It seems that Stellar, the extremely well-funded and well-marketed cryptocurrency, has struck a deal with Keybase to ‚Äúairdrop‚Äù (give away) their tokens to keybase users in an effort to drive adoption.

Keybase updated their iOS client to sign an attestation, as a user, that a given stellar address belongs to them, even if it does not. This is done without any user interaction or consent, violating the fundamental principle of Keybase‚Äôs product until now: the user controls their keys.

Of course, the user controls their keys using Keybase‚Äôs software, which, under normal circumstances, means the user controls their keys. But in this instance, Keybase‚Äôs software decided to sign, for a user, without their knowledge or consent, an attestation saying that `username*keybase.io` is a legitimate stellar payment address for the user‚Äîeven if the user has never heard of it.

[Here‚Äôs mine](https://keybase.io/sneak/sigchain#289375141b43421b024be60b0569cd701061fd37ca14f047e5d96a1bf8dacefe22). Note: **DO NOT** send payments to this address! I don‚Äôt have the keys for this address, don‚Äôt control this address, and don‚Äôt want any XLM shitcoins even if I did‚Äìdespite what Keybase‚Äôs client has claimed with my private keys.

There is no option to remove this payment address from [my Keybase profile](https://keybase.io/sneak), turning my Keybase profile page into an ad for a shitcoin, using my name, face, and identity as an implicit endorsement for Stellar. This is rude and unethical.

Keybase, I understand that you have no good revenue model. I know that good software costs money. I don‚Äôt have an alternative for you, but if selling out your users and violating their trust and consent (and, by extension, fraudulently claiming that published cryptocurrency addresses represent payment addresses for your users) is the best you can think of, then perhaps you should give up and stop existing as a concern.

I have filed this [as a bug](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3583), although I doubt it will be addressed sufficiently, as this is intentional behavior on the part of Keybase, who have hopefully been well-paid by Stellar for entirely undermining their tool‚Äôs trust.

## Edit/Update

There seems to be some semantic bickering around whether or not an encryption tool silently making signatures in violation of a user‚Äôs wishes (and in service of the financial aims of the maker of that tool) qualifies as a ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù.

[Keybase themselves have used the term ‚Äòbackdoor‚Äô to refer to an encryption program signing additional, unwanted keys against a user‚Äôs wishes.](https://keybase.io/blog/2014-10-08/the-horror-of-a-secure-golden-key)

This is a common, accepted usage in cryptography circles: when a tool that is used for signing or encryption/decryption creates a signature or decrypts a message *for anyone other than the user*, especially *without the knowledge or consent of that user*, it has hijacked use of the user‚Äôs keys and is no longer serving that user, but a remote attacker. That‚Äôs a backdoor.

## Edit 2

Don‚Äôt worry, everyone. [The guy who got paid a bunch of money to force these ads onto your profile said it‚Äôs not a backdoor.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21110473) He used all caps, so you know he means it. The capital-followers at HN have killed the link to this page, because the perpetrator said there‚Äôs nothing to see here. The [dozens of other users experiencing similar problems](https://github.com/keybase/client/issues/15555) must be mistaken, too, about what they wanted their keys to do.
