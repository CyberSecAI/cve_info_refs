Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. Specifically, it resides within the login page of GFI Kerio Control firewalls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability occurs due to the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) within the victim's browser. This means the malicious script isn't necessarily embedded in the server's response but rather constructed client-side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the login page.
- **Credential Theft:** By manipulating the login page, the attacker can redirect user credentials (including cleartext passwords) to a location under their control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that, when visited by a user, injects the XSS payload into the login page's DOM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim to visit the crafted URL. This could be achieved through phishing or other social engineering techniques.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need any privileged access to the server itself to exploit this vulnerability.
