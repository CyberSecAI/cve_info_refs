- **Root cause of vulnerability:** MobaXterm's protocol handler on Windows is vulnerable to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of user-supplied input within the protocol handler, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve command execution on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious link (e.g., in a webpage) using the MobaXterm:// protocol handler.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and have the victim user click it and confirm a series of popups. The user must have MobaXterm installed.
