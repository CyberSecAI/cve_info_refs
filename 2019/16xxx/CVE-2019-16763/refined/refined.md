Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16763:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of URLs used in the Pannellum library, specifically when handling hot spots or links within the panorama viewer. The `sanitizeURL` function did not properly block data URIs or `vbscript:` URLs

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the possibility of XSS due to inadequate URL sanitization. By crafting malicious URLs, attackers could inject arbitrary JavaScript into the user's browser when they interact with hot spots or links.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
- **Cookie Theft/Session Hijacking:** If the `pannellum.htm` file is hosted on a domain that shares cookies with a user's authenticated session, an attacker could potentially steal cookies or hijack a user's session.
- **Access to User Information:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user if the targeted site lacks adequate CSRF protections.
- **Redirection/Phishing:** Attackers might redirect users to malicious sites or create phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Hot Spots/Links:** The primary attack vector is through the use of malicious URLs within the hot spots or other links configured in the Pannellum panorama.
- **Attacker-Provided Configuration:** An attacker would need to provide a configuration with malicious URLs to the vulnerable Pannellum instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Configuration Control:** Attackers would need to have the ability to control or influence the configuration of a Pannellum viewer to insert malicious URLs.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, specifically, the user needs to click on the malicious hot spot or link within the panorama viewer.
- **Hosting on Shared Domain (Optional):** For a more severe impact, the attacker could host `pannellum.htm` on a domain that shares cookies with the targeted site.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Max Schaefer of the GitHub Security Lab.
- The fix for the vulnerability was implemented in version 2.5.5 of the Pannellum library. The patch adds checks to prevent javascript: and vbscript: URLs, as well as data: URIs when used for links.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE ID CVE-2019-16763
- The advisory GHSA ID is GHSA-m52x-29pq-w3vv
