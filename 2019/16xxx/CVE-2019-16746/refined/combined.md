                 CVE-2019-19966

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-19051

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m
    wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19052

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the gs_usb
    CAN driver if the open (interface-up) operation fails.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19056, CVE-2019-19057

    wifi driver if the probe operation fails.  The security impact of
    this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19062

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the AF_ALG
    subsystem if the CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG operation fails.  A local user
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

CVE-2019-19066

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the bfa SCSI
    driver if the get_fc_host_stats operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19227

    Dan Carpenter reported missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation that could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19332

## [TAA\_MCEPSC\_i915](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/TAA_MCEPSC_i915)

## TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA, CVE-2019-11135), Intel® Processor Machine Check Error (MCEPSC, CVE-2018-12207), and i915 graphics (CVE-2019-0155, CVE-2019-0154) vulnerabilities

### TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA, CVE-2019-11135) vulnerability

Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss and Jo Van Bulck discovered that memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core via a speculative execution side-channel, a similar vulnerability to [Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS)](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/MDS). The TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) vulnerability allows an attacker to access the same buffers (store buffer, fill buffer, load port writeback data bus) as MDS, but through Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel® TSX). As a result, unintended memory exposure can occur between userspace processes, between the kernel and userspace, between virtual machines, or between a virtual machine and the host environment.

This issue only affects processors that support Intel® TSX. For processors that support Intel® TSX and were previously affected by MDS, the existing MDS buffer clearing mitigations also mitigate TAA, and no additional mitigations are needed.

For processors that support Intel® TSX and were not affected by MDS, TAA is mitigated by disabling Intel® TSX. Deployments that require Intel® TSX can enable it with the tsx=on kernel command-line parameter and microarchitectural buffer clearing mitigations, such as those used to mitigate MDS, will be used to mitigate TAA.

Mitigations for processors vulnerable to TAA are provided by a combination of processor microcode and Linux kernel updates.

For more details, including affected processor families, please see the [Intel TAA Deep Dive](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-intel-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intel-tsx-asynchronous-abort).

For details on how to check the system status and configure the software mitigations, please see the [Linux Kernel TSX Asynchronous Abort Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.html).
### Intel® Processor Machine Check Error (MCEPSC, CVE-2018-12207) vulnerability

Intel researchers discovered that a race condition existed in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) when converting 4K pages to 2MB or larger pages (called hugepages in Linux kernel parlance) that could generate a Machine Check Exception (MCE), resulting in a denial of service (system hang or shutdown). A malicious virtual machine could use this flaw to generate an MCE resulting in a denial of service of the host OS, including all other virtual machines.

There is no known attack vector when virtualization is not in use.

Mitigations for this issue are provided through updates to the Linux kernel.

This issue is also known as Machine Check Exception on Page Size Changes (MCEPSC). The Linux kernel refers to this issue as iTLB multihit.

For more details, including affected processor families, please see the [Intel MCEPSC Deep Dive](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-machine-check-error-avoidance-page-size-change-0)

For details on how to check the system status and configure the software mitigations, please see the [Linux Kernel iTLB Multihit Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/multihit.html).

### Intel i915 graphics (CVE-2019-0155, CVE-2019-0154) vulnerabilities

#### CVE-2019-0154

Intel researchers discovered that Intel graphics processors could cause a system hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input output (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

Mitigations for this issue are provided through updates to the firmware for the graphics processor and the kernel drivers.

#### CVE-2019-0155

Intel researchers discovered that Intel graphics processors allowed userspace to modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command Streamer and exposed kernel memory information, resulting in possible privilege escalation and information disclosure vulnerabilities. A local user could use this issue to escalate their privileges on the local machine.

Mitigations for this issue are provided through updates to the kernel drivers.

It was discovered late that the proposed fixes for this issue were incomplete in Ubuntu 64-bit x86 kernels. A [followup update](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1852141) was issued for affected kernels.

## Mitigations

### Public Cloud Image updates

* Amazon AWS: <IN PROGRESS>
* Windows Azure: <IN PROGRESS>
* Google Compute Engine: <IN PROGRESS>
* Ubuntu Core Images: <IN PROGRESS>

Cloud Images dailies will start appearing within 4 hours of the USN announcement. At the direction of the security team, the Cloud Image Team will start manually releasing new images to the public cloud.

## Checking System Status

Updated Ubuntu kernels have the ability to report how the system is currently affected by TAA and MCEPSC. You must apply the latest kernel updates and reboot before the kernel can indicate the status of each issue.

### TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA, CVE-2019-11135) Status

To check your system, read the contents of the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx\_async\_abort file.

Processors that aren't vulnerable to TAA will report the following:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Not affected
```

You may encounter a situation where you have an updated Ubuntu kernel but you don't have updated microcode. This could occur if you've not updated to the latest intel-microcode package or if Intel has not released new microcode for your processor. You'll see the following in this situation:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT vulnerable
```

On systems that support disabling TSX, it will be specified as the mitigation for TAA:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: TSX disabled
```

When TSX cannot be disabled or if TSX has been explicitly enabled by the system administrator, processors that have Hyper-Threading support will indicate that SMT is vulnerable:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT vulnerable
```

When TSX cannot be disabled or if TSX has been explicitly enabled by the system administrator and Intel Hyper-Threading is not support or has been disabled, the file will contain the following contents

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT disabled
```

The kernel is unable to reliably determine whether Hyper-Threading is enabled when running in a virtual environment. Updated host kernel packages, updated host qemu packages with proper configuration to pass through the host CPU type to the guest, and updated guest kernel packages will show the following status inside of the virtual environment:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT Host state unknown
```

The examples above cover the most common situations. Please see the [Linux Kernel TAA Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.html) for additional, less common situations.

### Intel® Processor Machine Check Error (MCEPSC, CVE-2018-12207) Status

To check your system, read the contents of the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb\_multihit file. The lack of the itlb\_multihit file indicates that the kernel is not updated and that the system is most likely vulnerable to MCEPSC. In general, all non-Atom processors that support Extended Page Tables (EPT) are vulnerable. The full list is documented in the [Intel MCEPSC Deep Dive](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-machine-check-error-avoidance-page-size-change-0).

Processors that aren't vulnerable to MCEPSC will report the following:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
  Not affected
```

The following example indicates that MCEPSC is mitigated:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
  KVM: Mitigation: Split huge pages
```

The file will indicate that the system is vulnerable when the MCEPSC mitigation is disabled:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
  KVM: Vulnerable
```

The examples above cover the most common situations. Please see the [Linux Kernel iTLB Multihit Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/multihit.html) for additional, less common situations.

From: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>

We currently don't validate the beacon head, i.e. the header,
fixed part and elements that are to go in front of the TIM
element. This means that the variable elements there can be
malformed, e.g. have a length exceeding the buffer size, but
most downstream code from this assumes that this has already
been checked.

Add the necessary checks to the netlink policy.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the OverlayFS and ShiftFS Drivers in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle reference counting during memory mapping

operations when used in conjunction with AUFS. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15794](/security/CVE-2019-15794))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi

configuration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-16746](/security/CVE-2019-16746))

It was discovered that there was a memory leak in the Advanced Buffer

Management functionality of the Netronome NFP4000/NFP6000 NIC Driver in the

Linux kernel during certain error scenarios. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19076](/security/CVE-2019-19076))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 869511 945023

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-13093, CVE-2018-13094

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer
    dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and
    operating a crafted XFS volume.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14615

    It was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not
    clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted
    in information leaks between GPU tasks.  This has been mitigated
    in the i915 driver.

    The affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at
    <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>>.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17075

    It was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA
    (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not
    supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of
    the stack.  A local user might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-18282

    Jonathan Berger, Amit Klein, and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of UDP/IPv6 flow labels used a weak hash function,
    "jhash".  This could enable tracking individual computers as they
    communicate with different remote servers and from different
    networks.  The "siphash" function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-18683

    Multiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media
    driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,
    These race conditions could result in a use-after-free.  On a
    system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission
    to access media devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-18809

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the af9005
    media driver if the device fails to respond to a command.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19037

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not
    correctly handle directories with holes (unallocated regions) in

## Details

Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo,

Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz

Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel

processors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could

expose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a

malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11135](/security/CVE-2019-11135))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets allowed userspace

to modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command

Streamer and expose kernel memory information. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges.

([CVE-2019-0155](/security/CVE-2019-0155))

Deepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel

did not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual

guest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to

cause a denial of service (host system crash). ([CVE-2018-12207](/security/CVE-2018-12207))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets could cause a

system hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input

output (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-0154](/security/CVE-2019-0154))

Jann Horn discovered a reference count underflow in the shiftfs

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-15791](/security/CVE-2019-15791))

Jann Horn discovered a type confusion vulnerability in the shiftfs

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-15792](/security/CVE-2019-15792))

Jann Horn discovered that the shiftfs implementation in the Linux kernel

did not use the correct file system uid/gid when the user namespace of a

lower file system is not in the init user namespace. A local attacker could

use this to possibly bypass DAC permissions or have some other unspecified

impact. ([CVE-2019-15793](/security/CVE-2019-15793))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi

configuration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-16746](/security/CVE-2019-16746))

Nico Waisman discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Realtek Wi-Fi

driver for the Linux kernel when handling Notice of Absence frames. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-17666](/security/CVE-2019-17666))

Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) and i915

(CVE-2019-0154) issues requires corresponding microcode and graphics

firmware updates respectively.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to

make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.199-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.199 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.199-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.199 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

## Details

Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo,

Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz

Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel

processors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could

expose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a

malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11135](/security/CVE-2019-11135))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets allowed userspace

to modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command

Streamer and expose kernel memory information. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges.

([CVE-2019-0155](/security/CVE-2019-0155))

Deepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel

did not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual

guest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to

cause a denial of service (host system crash). ([CVE-2018-12207](/security/CVE-2018-12207))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets could cause a

system hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input

output (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-0154](/security/CVE-2019-0154))

Hui Peng discovered that the Atheros AR6004 USB Wi-Fi device driver for the

Linux kernel did not properly validate endpoint descriptors returned by the

device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15098](/security/CVE-2019-15098))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi

configuration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-16746](/security/CVE-2019-16746))

Ori Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker

could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17052](/security/CVE-2019-17052))

Ori Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

([CVE-2019-17053](/security/CVE-2019-17053))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17054](/security/CVE-2019-17054))

Ori Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17055](/security/CVE-2019-17055))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

([CVE-2019-17056](/security/CVE-2019-17056))

Nico Waisman discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Realtek Wi-Fi

driver for the Linux kernel when handling Notice of Absence frames. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-17666](/security/CVE-2019-17666))

Maddie Stone discovered that the Binder IPC Driver implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-2215](/security/CVE-2019-2215))

Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) and i915

(CVE-2019-0154) issues requires corresponding microcode and graphics

firmware updates respectively.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi

configuration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-16746](/security/CVE-2019-16746))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-17133](/security/CVE-2019-17133))

It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19060](/security/CVE-2019-19060))

It was discovered that the Intel OPA Gen1 Infiniband Driver for the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19065](/security/CVE-2019-19065))

It was discovered that the Cascoda CA8210 SPI 802.15.4 wireless controller

driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain

error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19075](/security/CVE-2019-19075))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux

kernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-17075](/security/CVE-2019-17075))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
