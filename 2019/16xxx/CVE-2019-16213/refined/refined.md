{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web interface of the Tenda PA6 Wi-Fi Powerline extender allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary commands because user-supplied input is concatenated as an argument to the 'homeplugctl' application, and executed by the 'system' library function without proper sanitization or validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Weak default password ('admin')",
       "Lack of input sanitization/validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device, leading to complete device compromise. This can be leveraged to add the device to an IoT botnet, conduct DDoS attacks, pivot to other devices on the network, mine cryptocurrency, or other unauthorized activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web interface",
       "DNS rebinding"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web interface which can be achieved using the weak default password or by leveraging DNS rebinding to remotely access the device. Once authenticated, they can inject malicious commands through the device name parameter in the powerline settings."
