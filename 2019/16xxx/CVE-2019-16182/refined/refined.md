Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities fixed in LimeSurvey version 3.17.14, as described in the release notes:

**Vulnerabilities Fixed:**

*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) in admin box buttons:**
    *   **Weakness:**  XSS vulnerability in admin box buttons.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the admin interface, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the admin user (session hijacking, etc.).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Likely through user-controlled input being rendered without proper sanitization.
*   **XML breakout on export:**
    *   **Weakness:** XML export process vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attack.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially gain access to internal resources by manipulating XML data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Likely through manipulation of the data being exported as XML.
*   **X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN not set by default:**
    *  **Weakness:** Missing X-Frame-Options header.
    *   **Impact:** The absence of this header makes the application vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding LimeSurvey pages within malicious frames on attacker-controlled sites.
*   **User unaware that SSL encryption should be enforced:**
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of clear guidance or enforcement of SSL encryption.
    *   **Impact:** Users may not realize their communication with the server is not encrypted and data transmitted is vulnerable to eavesdropping.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks could intercept communication if SSL is not enforced.
*   **Path revelation:**
    *   **Weakness:** The application may inadvertently reveal server paths.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers gain information about the application's infrastructure.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Unspecified, likely in error messages or publicly accessible files.
*    **LDAP login non-generic login message:**
    *   **Weakness:** Revealing that the system uses LDAP may give an attacker an advantage in subsequent attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers gain information about the system
    *   **Attack Vector:** By attempting to log in with invalid credentials, an attacker can determine if LDAP authentication is being used.
*   **Equation signs are not masked by default on data export:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Equation signs in exported data were not masked, potentially enabling unintended data manipulation.
    *  **Impact:** Data integrity could be compromised if an attacker could use this to inject formulas into an exported spreadsheet
    *   **Attack Vector:** Through exporting the data.
*   **CSRF cookie missing HTTP only parameter:**
    *   **Weakness:**  CSRF cookie was not set with the HttpOnly flag, making it accessible to client-side scripts.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could potentially steal the CSRF token via XSS, leading to CSRF attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting other XSS vulnerabilities to access and use the CSRF token.
*   **Admin user without permissions can still see plugins page:**
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient access control on the plugins page.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized users can view plugin details.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Logging in as admin with insufficient permissions.
*    **Admin user with settings permissions can run integrity check:**
    *  **Weakness:**  Insufficient access control on the integrity check functionality.
    *  **Impact:** Potentially sensitive information about the system is exposed to admins with settings permission.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Logging in as admin with settings permission.
*   **Admin user with limited permissions can view/update/delete reserved menu entries:**
    *   **Weakness:** Inadequate access control for menu entries.
    *  **Impact:**  Unauthorized users can modify or delete menu items.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  Logging in as admin with insufficient permissions.
*   **Admin user can mark other user notification as read:**
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient permission control for notification read status.
    *   **Impact:** Can manipulate the status of notifications for other users.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  Logging in as admin user.
*  **Database backup uses browser cache:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Database backups are cached by the browser.
    *  **Impact:** Sensitive backup data might be leaked through the browser cache
    *  **Attack Vector:** Using the browser history or cache to access the backups.
*  **Browser cache used for exports:**
    *   **Weakness:** Exported data is cached by the browser.
    *   **Impact:** Sensitive data contained in the export might be leaked through the browser cache
    *   **Attack Vector:** Using the browser history or cache to access the exports.
*   **Stored XSS vulnerabilities (#15204):**
    *   **Weakness:**  Stored XSS vulnerability is present.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious scripts can be stored and executed when other users interact with the stored content.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into stored content through vulnerable entry points
*   **Reflected XSS vulnerabilities (#15204):**
    *   **Weakness:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities are present.
    *   **Impact:**  Malicious scripts can be executed in a user's browser through specially crafted requests.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious links to trigger the XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Survey upload self-reflecting XSS:**
    *   **Weakness:** Vulnerable to self-reflected XSS through survey uploads.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious scripts can be executed when the user uploads a specially crafted survey file
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a crafted survey file

*   **Submitting empty menu entry crashes application (Denial of Service):**
    *   **Weakness:** Application does not properly handle empty menu entries.
    *   **Impact:** The server can be crashed by submitting empty menu entries, resulting in a denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Submitting empty menu entries.

**Root Causes:**

*   Lack of proper input validation and sanitization, which leads to XSS, XML breakout, and DoS vulnerabilities
*   Insufficient access controls for various admin features.
*   Improper handling of sensitive data in browser caching.
*   Missing security headers like `X-Frame-Options`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Many of the reported issues were identified by Pavol Michalec & Frederik Koľbík, and J. Greil from the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
*   The release notes mention various other fixes related to functionality and usability, but they are not security related.
