- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an insufficiently random session ID generation mechanism used for several post-authentication actions in the SANnav portal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable session IDs (CWE-341).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers could potentially brute-force valid session IDs, allowing them to hijack user sessions.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access to the SANnav portal.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the SANnav portal remotely and must have the ability to hijack a user session. The exploit is only possible once a user has authenticated.
