The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16352.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-buffer-overflow in the `jfif_load()` function within `jfif.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists due to an out-of-bounds write in the `jfif_load()` function at line 187 in `jfif.c`. The allocated buffer size is insufficient for the data being written.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The heap-buffer-overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially causing a crash or allowing arbitrary code execution.
- The ASan report shows the program aborting after the overflow is detected.
- GDB report shows the program crashing due to invalid pointer and memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG file (`poc22-jfif_load-heapoverflow`) using the ffjpeg application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious JPEG file as input to the `ffjpeg` application.
- The attacker does not need to be in any specific position, as long as the `ffjpeg` application is processing the malicious file, the vulnerability can be triggered.
