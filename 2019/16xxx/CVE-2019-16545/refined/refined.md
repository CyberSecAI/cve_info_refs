Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin transmits the password in plain text as part of the configuration form, even though the password is stored encrypted on disk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Transmission:** The vulnerability lies in the transmission of the password in plain text within the configuration form of the plugin. This occurs even though the password is encrypted when stored.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** The plaintext transmission exposes the password to various attack vectors, including:
    *   Browser extensions with malicious intent.
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which can be leveraged to capture the password during form submission.
    *   Other similar situations where network traffic or browser activity can be monitored/intercepted by attackers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker could potentially intercept the plaintext password during transmission, particularly if the connection is not secured with HTTPS.
*   **Browser-based Attacks:** Malicious browser extensions or XSS vulnerabilities could be exploited to capture the password as it's transmitted from the browser.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** A MitM attacker could potentially intercept the communication and extract the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be in a position to observe or intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the Jenkins server.
*   **Browser Exploitation:** The attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within the user's browser, including XSS vulnerabilities in the Jenkins server or malicious browser extensions.
*   **User Interaction:** While not a direct user interaction, the vulnerability requires a user to access and interact with the configuration form of the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin up to version 1.13.
*   A fix was not available at the time of the advisory.
*   The stored password on disk is encrypted since version 1.13, which is good, but the transmission vulnerability remains a problem.
