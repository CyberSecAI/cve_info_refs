Due to the uncontrolled nature of the previous full disclosure of this vulnerability in `jhipster-kotlin` this is an 0-Day vulnerability disclosure for jhipster-kotlin.

See: [jhipster/generator-jhipster#10401](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10401)

[GHSA-mwp6-j9wf-968c](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/security/advisories/GHSA-mwp6-j9wf-968c "GHSA-mwp6-j9wf-968c")

There is currently no patch available at this time.

# [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)

JHipster is using an insecure source of randomness to generate all of it's random values. JHipster relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`.

From the documentation:

> Caveat: Instances of Random, upon which the implementation of this class relies, are not cryptographically secure.
>
> - <https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.9/org/apache/commons/lang3/RandomStringUtils.html>

Here are the examples of JHipster Kotlin's use of an insecure PRNG:

[jhipster-kotlin/generators/server/templates/src/main/kotlin/package/service/util/RandomUtil.kt.ejs](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/blob/193ae8f13c0be686f9687e78bacfedb144c47d8c/generators/server/templates/src/main/kotlin/package/service/util/RandomUtil.kt.ejs#L27-L62)

## Proof Of Concepts Already Exist

There has been a POC of taking one RNG value generated `RandomStringUtils` and reversing it to generate all of the past/future RNG values public since March 3rd, 2018.

[https://medium.com/@alex91ar/the-java-soothsayer-a-practical-application-for-insecure-randomness-c67b0cd148cd](https://medium.com/%40alex91ar/the-java-soothsayer-a-practical-application-for-insecure-randomness-c67b0cd148cd)

POC Repository: <https://github.com/alex91ar/randomstringutils>

## Potential Impact Technical

All that is required is to get one password reset token from a JHipster generated service and using the POC above, you can reverse what all future password reset tokens to be generated by this server. This allows an attacker to pick and choose what account they would like to takeover by sending account password reset requests for targeted accounts.

# JHipster release v6.3.0

This release fixes an **important security vulnerability**:

* Please read the [security advisory here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/security/advisories/GHSA-mwp6-j9wf-968c).
* **Are you vulnerable?** if you use JWT, session or UAA authentication, and more importantly if you use our system to send a link to reset passwords, then you are affected. The algorithm used isn't cryptographically secure, which means that an attacker could guess a reset link, and hence take over any account in the system.
* **How to fix the issue** you probably don't need to upgrade JHipster, as this just affects a few generated files, so this can be done manually. The issue is in the generated `RandomUtil` class. [Here is this class in our sample application generated with JHipster v6.2.0](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app/blob/v6.2.0/src/main/java/io/github/jhipster/sample/service/util/RandomUtil.java) and [here is the updated version, using JHipster v6.3.0](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app/blob/v6.3.0/src/main/java/io/github/jhipster/sample/service/util/RandomUtil.java). So all you need to do is copy the new file, which uses `SecureRandom`, and replace the older file.
* **How this issue was handled** This issue was found by [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh), and was fixed in the next couple of hours by [Frederik Hahne](https://github.com/atomfrede). Please note that we gave a [$500 bug bounty to Jonathan](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10401) as well as a [$300 bug bounty to Frederik](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10402). For obvious security reasons, only the [JHipster core dev team](https://www.jhipster.tech/team/) knew about this issue during that period. We then waited one day in order to inform everyone, including doing [an advisory on our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jhipster/status/1172387424715988994) so that our users are not caught up with a surprise emergency release.
* **What will happen next** This is the first time we used the "security advisory" feature from GitHub. We certainly learned a lot, and we will provide in the very near future a clear path to report security advisories to the team.

**What's new in this release**

Apart from the security vulnerability, this is a minor release of JHipster v6 with [247 closed tickets and merged pull requests](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A6.3.0+is%3Aclosed).

Here are the most significant ones:

* Upgrade to Spring Boot 2.1.8 and Spring Cloud Greenwich SR3
* All Docker images have been upgraded to their latest versions
* Migration from Tslint to Eslint ([#10187](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10187) and [#10213](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10213)). The JHipster ESlint configuration is now externalized in a new repository at <https://github.com/jhipster/eslint-config-jhipster> [#10358](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10358)
* Created Jar is now non executable by default [#10282](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10282)
* Enforce architecture constraints with ArchUnit [#10274](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10274)
* Add a new Feign Client sub-generator based on OpenAPIGenerator [#9548](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/9548)
* Liquibase can use different credentials than the one in the application (so the running application cannot change the current schema)
* Add support for Caffeine Cache [#10303](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10303)
* Enhance Google App Engine generator with Java 11, Jar support and more ([#10284](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10284) and [#10336](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10336))
* Fix the AWS generator monolith flow [#10376](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10376)
* Fix admin logs screen in Angular [jhipster/ng-jhipster#97](https://github.com/jhipster/ng-jhipster/pull/97)
* Fix interactions between main generator and blueprint when one is installed globally and the other locally [#10257](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10257)
* Fix issues with Istio URLs [#10135](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10135)

## Closed tickets and merged pull requests[​](#closed-tickets-and-merged-pull-requests "Direct link to Closed tickets and merged pull requests")

As always, **[you can check all closed tickets and merged pull requests here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A6.3.0+is%3Aclosed)**.

## How to upgrade[​](#how-to-upgrade "Direct link to How to upgrade")

**Automatic upgrade**

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator](/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

Upgrade your version of JHipster:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster

```

And then run the upgrade sub-generator:

```
jhipster upgrade

```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster

```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster

```

You can also update your project and all its entities by running

```
jhipster --with-entities

```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named *Foo*

```
jhipster entity Foo

```
