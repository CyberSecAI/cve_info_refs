```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses an insecure source of randomness to generate critical values such as password reset keys, activation keys, and remember-me tokens. Specifically, it utilizes `RandomStringUtils` from Apache Commons Lang, which is explicitly noted as not cryptographically secure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can predict future password reset tokens, activation keys, and remember-me tokens after obtaining one such token. This would allow account takeover and privilege escalation, potentially enabling the attacker to gain control over any account in the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the generation of random values for password resets, account activation, and remember-me authentication. An attacker needs to obtain one of these values.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to obtain one generated random string (e.g. password reset token) to compromise the PRNG and predict all future random values generated by the server. This can be achieved by requesting a password reset for a known account."
