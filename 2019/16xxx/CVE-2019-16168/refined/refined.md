**2. Extracted information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    *   The root cause is a division by zero error in the `whereLoopAddBtreeIndex` function within the SQLite query planner, specifically due to missing validation of the `sqlite_stat1 sz` field.
    *   Malformed `sqlite_stat1` entries, where the `sz` value is set to 0, trigger the division-by-zero error when processing certain queries.
    *   The vulnerability was introduced in SQLite version 3.8.5
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Improper validation of input data
    *   Division-by-zero error
    *   Lack of checks for zero values in the `sz` field
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or browser
    *   Potential for unauthorized takeover of Java
    *   Heap-based buffer over-read (in some related cases) leading to information leaks or potentially arbitrary code execution
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Maliciously crafted SQL queries, particularly those involving subqueries or window functions
    *   Maliciously crafted XML input using SOAP extension
    *   A malformed `sqlite_stat1` entry
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Ability to submit a crafted SQL query to a vulnerable SQLite database
    *   Ability to cause a malformed XML data to be returned by a SOAP server to a vulnerable PHP application
    *   An authenticated local administrator can exploit the local privilege escalation vulnerability on windows systems where Nessus agents are installed.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `whereLoopAddBtreeIndex` function, specifically at the line where `rCostIdx` is calculated involving a division by `pSrc->pTab->szTabRow`.
*   The `szTabRow` value can be maliciously set to 0 by inserting a malformed record in the `sqlite_stat1` table or by using a malicious SOAP server
*   The vulnerability can be triggered using a query like `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT 0 FROM t001 WHERE t001.a IN(SELECT 0)` or by crafting a custom XML payload.
*   The issue is fixed by adding a check for zero `sz` values.

**Affected Software (from different advisories):**
*   SQLite versions through 3.29.0 and 3.30.1
*   PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.27, 7.4.x below 7.4.15 and 8.0.x below 8.0.2 when using SOAP extension
*   Nessus Agent versions 8.14.0 and earlier for Windows
*   Tenable.sc versions 5.18.0 and earlier
*   Various SUSE, openSUSE, Oracle, and NetApp products using affected SQLite/PHP versions

The content also highlights the complexity of fixing such vulnerabilities as they can exist in multiple code components of an application and also spread through 3rd party libraries, and they can require multiple remediation steps for a single CVE.
