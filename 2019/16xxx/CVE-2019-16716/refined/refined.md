{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The RMI default configuration could flip to unexpected values, allowing to invoke classes outside of the own codebase.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper access control (CWE-284)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Malicious code could be executed on server-side, if the attacker can issue RMI provisioning commands.",
  "Attack vectors": "Issuing RMI provisioning commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to breach several levels of security measures and have elevated permissions on the target system."
