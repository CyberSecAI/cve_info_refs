- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Brocade SANnav versions before v2.0 use a hard-coded password for the back-end database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Local authenticated attackers could access the back-end database and gain privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, requires database service exposure, and the default password should be in use.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local authenticated access to the system, and the default database password needs to be unchanged.
