The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `yii2-cms` application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `name` field of the contact form, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The injected JavaScript payload is stored in the database and executed when the administrator views the contact form submissions.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `name` field in the `Contact.php` model lacks proper input validation and length restrictions, allowing arbitrary code to be injected. Specifically, the code reveals that `name` has a max length of 90, which is not being enforced, allowing the `<script>` tag to be successfully injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser when they view contact form submissions.
- This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking.
  - Stealing of administrator credentials and session tokens.
  - Defacement of the admin panel.
  - Redirecting the administrator to a malicious page.
  - Other malicious actions that could compromise the application or its users.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user can submit a contact form through the `/contact.html` endpoint.
- The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload, such as `<script>alert(1)</script>`, into the `name` field.
- When the administrator views the contact form submissions in the admin panel, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the contact form.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to submit the form.
- The attacker needs the administrator to view the malicious stored content in their browser within the application backend.
