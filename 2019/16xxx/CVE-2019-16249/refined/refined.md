Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `cv::hal_baseline::v_load` function, which is located in `core/hal/intrin_sse.hpp`. This occurs when the `computeSSDMeanNorm` function in `modules/video/src/dis_flow.cpp` calls `v_load`.
*   The `DISOpticalFlowImpl::PatchInverseSearch_ParBody::operator()` in `dis_flow.cpp` incorrectly calculates the index of the `uchar` array `I1_ptr`. This results in passing a pointer to the last 12 bytes of a buffer to `computeSSDMeanNorm`. The `computeSSDMeanNorm` function then attempts to read 16 bytes from this pointer through the `HAL_PROCESS_BILINEAR_8x8_PATCH_EXTRACTION` macro, leading to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read in `v_load`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to an incorrect pointer calculation, causing `v_load` to attempt to read beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Incorrect Index Calculation:** The root cause is traced back to an incorrect index calculation in `DISOpticalFlowImpl::PatchInverseSearch_ParBody::operator()`.
*  **Conditional Compilation:** The vulnerable code within `computeSSDMeanNorm` is only compiled if the `CV_SIMD128` macro is defined. This macro is defined when SSE support is enabled, and the `intrin_sse.hpp` header is included through `intrin.hpp`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The out-of-bounds read results in a crash, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output. This is due to the program attempting to access memory that it does not own.
*   **Potential for Information Disclosure:**  Although the provided information specifies a crash, out-of-bounds reads can potentially lead to information disclosure if the read data is used later in the program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through the DIS optical flow algorithm in OpenCV.
*   Specifically, the `computeSSDMeanNorm` function called within the DIS optical flow calculation is the point of failure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to provide input that triggers the vulnerable DIS optical flow calculations within OpenCV.
*   The attacker needs to ensure that the code is compiled with SSE support enabled so the `CV_SIMD128` is defined, which will include the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was fixed upstream by replacing the call to `v_load()` with `v_load_expand()` in the `HAL_PROCESS_BILINEAR_8x8_PATCH_EXTRACTION` macro. `v_load_expand()` only reads 8 bytes, resolving the out-of-bounds issue.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are not affected because they do not include support for the DIS optical flow algorithm.
*  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not vulnerable despite including SSE support since the `intrin.hpp` header was not included in the `dis_flow.cpp` file.

In summary, CVE-2019-16249 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in OpenCV's DIS optical flow algorithm that can cause a crash. It is triggered by an incorrect index calculation leading to memory access beyond buffer boundaries.
