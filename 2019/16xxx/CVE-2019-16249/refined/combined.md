**Build type:** `Release`

**OpenCV version:** `4.1.2-pre`

**OS:** `Linux 4.15.0-62-generic #69-Ubuntu`

**OpenCV VCS version:** `4.1.1-217-g4de115c08`

I've complied opencv with clang enabling ASAN while fuzzing the opencv\_test\_video binary `crashes at cv::hal_baseline::v_load()` and `cv::computeSSDMeanNorm()`

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1752702#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-09-17 03:13:58 UTC  ``` OpenCV 4.1.1 has an out-of-bounds read in hal_baseline::v_load in core/hal/intrin_sse.hpp when called from computeSSDMeanNorm in modules/video/src/dis_flow.cpp.  Upstream issue:  <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/15481>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1752702#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-09-17 03:14:11 UTC  ``` Created opencv tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1752703](show_bug.cgi?id=1752703 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-16249 opencv: Out-of-bounds read in hal_baseline::v_load in core/hal/intrin_sse.hpp [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1752702#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2019-11-26 13:32:52 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/cd7fa04985b10db5e66de542725d0da57f0d10b6>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1752702#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2019-11-26 16:33:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7 as they did not include support for DIS optflow algorithm. This issue did not affect the versions of OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 as DIS optflow algorithm did not include support for Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1752702#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2019-11-26 16:35:06 UTC  ``` For the DIS optflow algorithm to be vulnerable the CV_SIMD128 macro has to be defined, as the vulnerable code in computeSSDMeanNorm function is conditionally compiled based on the value of that macro. Specifically, CV_SIMD128 is defined in the header file intrin_sse.hpp which, in turn, is included by intrin.hpp if SSE support is enabled. Despite the support of SSE, the version of OpenCV shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw due to the header file "opencv2/core/hal/intrin.hpp" not being included in the source file dis_flow.cpp.   The commit that removed the include statement from dis_flow.cpp is <https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/commit/64b3bbb6201b183db37ec3d6bc47c595c150b0d3>. Please note that the commit refers to opencv_contrib repository, as optflow algorithm was an "extra" module under development. The optflow algorithm has been successively moved to the central OpenCV repository in release 4.0.0 (Pull Request <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/13084>). The missing header has been reintroduced later with a fix in commit <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/c96850ba599ada02dad6bd1a4271ce8f4f20e246>.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1752702#c6)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2019-11-26 16:39:16 UTC  ``` Function DISOpticalFlowImpl::PatchInverseSearch_ParBody::operator() in dis_flow.cpp wrongly computes the index of the uchar array I1_ptr. Consequently, a pointer to the last 12 bytes is passed as second argument to function computeSSDMeanNorm which reads 16 bytes from it through the HAL_PROCESS_BILINEAR_8x8_PATCH_EXTRACTION macro. This leads to a 4-byte out-of-bound read in v_load function defined in intrin_sse.hpp.  Upstream fix replaces the v_load() call in HAL_PROCESS_BILINEAR_8x8_PATCH_EXTRACTION macro with v_load_expand() which only reads 8 bytes from the pointer passed as argument.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1752702#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-11-26 19:04:56 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-16249>   ``` |  |
