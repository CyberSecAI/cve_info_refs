{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure deserialization of data from cookies using the `unserialize()` function in two locations: `view/ProductsView.php` and `api/Comparison.php`. User-controlled data from the `price_filter` and `comparison` cookies are directly passed to the `unserialize()` function without any sanitization or validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Unauthenticated access"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution by injecting a malicious PHP object through a crafted cookie. This can lead to the ability to upload a webshell, execute arbitrary commands on the server, and potentially take full control of the affected system. The provided proof of concept demonstrated arbitrary file deletion.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests with crafted cookies. Specifically, the `price_filter` cookie (in `view/ProductsView.php`) or the `comparison` cookie (in `api/Comparison.php`) can be used to inject a serialized PHP object.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires no authentication. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and set the malicious cookie values. No other specific capabilities or specific position in the network is required."
