```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The PilusCart e-commerce software does not properly validate the 'filename' parameter passed to the `catalog.php` script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Disclosure (LFD)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted GET request to `catalog.php` with a `filename` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, which implies no special privileges and can be done remotely.
