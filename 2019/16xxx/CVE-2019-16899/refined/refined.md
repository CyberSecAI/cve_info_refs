Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-16899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The provided blog post describes multiple crash cases in Advantech WebAccess/HMI Designer 2.1.9.31, discovered through fuzzing. These crashes indicate memory corruption and other issues that could potentially be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Case #01**: Data from a faulting address controls branch selection, resulting in a crash. Specifically, the instruction `mov edi,dword ptr [eax]` attempts to dereference an invalid address `fffffff0`, leading to an access violation.
- **Case #02**: Data from a faulting address controls branch selection. A `cmp` instruction tries to access memory at an address that is not valid `0ca8c000`.
- **Case #03**: Read Access Violation. The instruction `mov eax,dword ptr [ecx]` tries to read from address `62800000`, which results in an access violation.
- **Case #04**: Data from a faulting address controls branch selection within heap management functions. The `cmp` instruction attempts to read from an invalid address `200073ff`.
- **Case #05**: Data from a faulting address controls code flow which is classified as probably exploitable. The `mov eax, dword ptr [edi]` instruction tries to dereference a NULL pointer.
- **Case #06**: User Mode Write Access Violation. A `mov` instruction tries to write to an invalid address during a `memcpy` operation.
- **Case #07**: Exception Handler Chain Corruption leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
  - Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crashes.
  - Potentially arbitrary code execution by controlling program flow and memory locations.
  -  Memory corruption that can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves crafting specific inputs/data that trigger the vulnerabilities in the Advantech WebAccess/HMI Designer software. This could involve malformed project files, network data or other input vectors handled by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need the ability to supply a crafted input or data to the vulnerable software. This could be achieved through:
    -  Opening a malicious project file.
    -  Manipulating network traffic to the application.
    - Any other input vector the application parses.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post mentions that the identified bugs were reported to ZDI (Zero Day Initiative) and CVE team.
- The author provided a zip file containing crashing inputs/proof-of-concepts which were publicly available on GitHub ([https://github.com/c610/tmp/blob/master/Crashing%20Advantech%20Webaccess-fewbugs.zip](https://github.com/c610/tmp/blob/master/Crashing%20Advantech%20Webaccess-fewbugs.zip)).
- The blog post indicates that the author found the bugs in a short timeframe, which shows that simple fuzzing could easily discover these vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerabilities were found in the process of fuzzing, not through reverse engineering of the application.
