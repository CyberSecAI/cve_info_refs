  "Vulnerability": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2019-16734",
    "Source": "blog.securityevaluators.com_ae1580e9_20250121_004756.html",
    "Title": "Telnet Enabled with Default Credentials",
    "Description": "Both Skymee Petalk AI and Petwant PF-103 devices start a Telnet server on boot that prompts for a username and password.",
    "Root_Cause": "The root user's password hash in /etc/shadow uses the original DES-based hashing algorithm without a salt, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. The password was easily cracked via a Google search.",
    "Affected_Devices": [
      "Skymee Petalk AI (firmware version 3.2.2.30)",
      "Petwant PF-103 (firmware version 4.3.2.50)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can gain a root shell on the device via Telnet using the default credentials.",
    "Attack_Vector": "Network access to the Telnet port (default port 23).",
    "Attacker_Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device or have the Telnet port exposed. They also need to know the default credentials (root:059AnkJ).",
    "Remediation": {
      "Petwant PF-103": "Version 4.22.2.42 of the PF-103 disables Telnet by default.",
      "Skymee Petalk AI": "This vulnerability has not been patched."
    },
    "Additional_Details": "The /etc/shadow file contains the password hashes. The root user's hash (FCb/N1tGGXtP6) can be easily cracked using online resources."
