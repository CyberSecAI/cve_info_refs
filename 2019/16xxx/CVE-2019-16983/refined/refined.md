  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `paging` function in `resources/paging.php` uses an unsanitized `param` variable constructed partially from the URL arguments, which is then reflected in the HTML.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within the `param` variable. When an authenticated user clicks this URL, the malicious code is executed in their browser.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince an authenticated user to click on a specially crafted URL."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerable code is in the `resources/paging.php` file in FusionPBX up to version 4.5.7. The fix involves sanitizing the `param` variable before using it in the HTML output. The vulnerability was reported by Pierre Jourdan on 10/08/2019 and fixed on 12/08/2019 by Mark J Crane. The provided commit diff shows the sanitization of the 'param' variable."
