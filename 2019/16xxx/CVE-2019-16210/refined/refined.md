- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An information exposure vulnerability exists where the Brocade SANnav software logs the plain text database connection password when a support save is triggered.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the logging of sensitive information (database password) in plain text within a support save file. This is a violation of secure coding practices, where passwords should never be stored or logged in a reversible format.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker with access to the support save file can obtain the exposed database password. This password can potentially be used for further attacks, especially if the database service is exposed outside of the SANnav server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs local access to the server where SANnav is installed, and must be able to trigger a support save operation to generate the log file containing the password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user and be able to obtain the support save file. The database service must also be exposed externally for the vulnerability to be exploitable further, and that would require root level access to the server.
