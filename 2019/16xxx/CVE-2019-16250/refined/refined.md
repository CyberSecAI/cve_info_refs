The provided content describes a vulnerability in the WordPress Ocean Extra plugin, which aligns with the CVE description for CVE-2019-16250.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks, input sanitization, and security nonces in the `ocean_customize_setup()` function and subsequently in `save_ocean_customize()`. This allows unauthenticated users to modify certain WordPress settings and inject CSS code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Settings Change Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated users can modify the WordPress `blogname`, `blogdescription`, and `site_icon` settings.
*   **CSS Injection Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated users can inject arbitrary CSS code into the blog, potentially leading to defacement.
*   **Missing Capability Checks:** The vulnerable functions lack checks to ensure only authorized users can access them.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User input for various settings and CSS is not sanitized, allowing for malicious CSS injection.
*   **Missing Security Nonces:** The code lacks nonces to protect against CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Blog Defacement:** Attackers can inject CSS code to alter the appearance of the website significantly.
*   **Settings Modification:** Attackers can change the site title, tagline, and favicon.
*   **Potential for phishing:** While direct HTML or PHP injection is prevented, attackers can still use CSS to inject malicious content such as a fake login form.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerabilities are accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack involves sending crafted POST requests to the `admin-post.php` script with specific parameters such as page and step.
*  **CSS Injection:** The attacker injects CSS code via POST parameters, such as `ocean-links-hover-color`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **No prior authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any specific privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress site to send HTTP requests.
