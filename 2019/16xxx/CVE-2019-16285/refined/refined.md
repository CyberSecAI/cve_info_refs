  "cve": "CVE-2019-16285",
  "source": "seclists.org_b9f169ff_20250121_010555.html",
  "details": {
    "vulnerability_summary": "If the thin client is configured with `local user must login` then an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the thin client can extract sensitive information onto a USB drive. This information could then lead to the attacker gaining administrative access to this device and others on the network.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "HP ThinPro Linux 7.1",
      "HP ThinPro Linux 7.0",
      "HP ThinPro Linux 6.2.1",
      "HP ThinPro Linux 6.2"
    ],
    "attack_vector": "Physical access to the thin client",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Unauthenticated attacker with physical access",
    "impact": "Information disclosure leading to potential administrative access",
    "weakness": "The `generate diagnostic` feature under the `system logs` tab of the `system information` window can be exploited to generate a tar ball containing sensitive files.",
    "root_cause": "Insecure configuration allowing unauthenticated users to access the diagnostic feature.",
    "technical_details": "An attacker can use the `generate diagnostic` feature under the `system logs` tab of the `system information` window to generate a tar ball containing sensitive files, such as the `/root` directory including `.bash_history`, the `registry.xml` file from `/writeable/tmp` and `shadow-` from `/etc`. These files can be found under their relative path under the `files/` directory in the generated `Diagnostic.tgz`.",
    "poc": "1. Insert USB drive\n2. At the login screen press the wrench icon on the login window\n3. Press the `i` icon\n4. Select the `System Logs` tab\n5. Select `Trace` in the dropdown for the Debug level\n6. Click the `Diagnostic` button to generate the `Diagnostic.tgz` file\n7. Save file to drive\n8. On a different computer extract the file\n9. Observe the presence and content of the following files:\n  * `files/etc/shadow-`\n  * `files/writeable/tmp/registry.xml`\n  * `files/root/.bash_history`"
