  "raw_description": "A specially crafted Bitcoin script can cause a discrepancy between the specified SLP consensus rules and the validation result of the slp-validate@1.0.0 npm package. An attacker could create a specially crafted Bitcoin script in order to cause a hard-fork from the SLP consensus.",
  "affected_versions": "1.0.0",
  "fixed_versions": "All versions >1.0.0 have been patched.",
  "details": "The vulnerability is due to a validator parsing discrepancy caused by string encoding issues in `slp-validate` version 1.0.0.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this by crafting a specific Bitcoin script that leads to inconsistencies between SLP consensus rules and the validation result produced by the `slp-validate@1.0.0` npm package. This could potentially cause a hard fork from the SLP consensus.\n\nThe fix involved updates to `lib/slp.ts` to properly handle string encodings during script parsing.",
