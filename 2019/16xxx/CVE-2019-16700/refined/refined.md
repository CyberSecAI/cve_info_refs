Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-16700:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The "SLUB: Event Registration" TYPO3 extension allowed arbitrary file uploads to the web server.
- Additionally, the extension included a vulnerable version of jQuery (2.2.4) susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Unrestricted File Upload:** The extension did not properly validate or restrict the types of files being uploaded, allowing an attacker to upload any file type.
2.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In older versions (1.2.2 and below), the unrestricted file upload vulnerability leads to RCE.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS):** In versions later than 1.2.2, the file upload vulnerability could lead to a DoS by filling the web server's storage with arbitrary files.
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The included vulnerable jQuery library introduces a XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **Remote Code Execution:** In older versions, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts).
2. **Denial of Service:** Attackers could upload a large number of files to fill up the server's disk space, rendering the service unavailable.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users of the website, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unrestricted file upload: An attacker could directly upload malicious files through the vulnerable extension's upload functionality.
- XSS: By injecting malicious scripts through the vulnerable jQuery library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges on the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality of the vulnerable extension.
- The attacker can be an unauthenticated user.
