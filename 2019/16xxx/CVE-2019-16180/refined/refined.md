The provided content is a commit log for LimeSurvey, specifically focusing on release 3.17.14. It contains multiple security fixes. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed in this Commit:**

*   **XSS in admin box buttons:**
    *   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into admin box buttons, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activity when an administrator interacts with the affected buttons.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Injection of malicious scripts through the admin box buttons.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to inject the malicious code, likely through a compromised administrative function.
*   **XML breakout on export:**
    *   **Weakness:** XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.

    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the XML export functionality by injecting malicious XML.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to control or inject content into the XML export process.
*   **X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN not set by default:**
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of X-Frame-Options header.
    *   **Impact:** The absence of this header allows the LimeSurvey application to be embedded in an iframe on other sites, potentially opening it up to clickjacking attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding the application in an iframe on a malicious website.
    *  **Attacker Capability**: Requires the ability to create a malicious webpage.
*   **User unaware that SSL encryption should be enforced:**

    *  **Impact:** Users might not enforce SSL which could expose transmitted data to interception and modification.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks against unencrypted connections.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Needs to be in a network position to perform a MITM attack
*   **Path revelation:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Information disclosure vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  The application might inadvertently reveal internal paths, potentially aiding attackers in reconnaissance or planning further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Unclear, likely involves observing responses from the application.
    *   **Attacker Capability:**  The ability to observe responses or induce the system to reveal path information.
*   **LDAP login non-generic login message:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Information disclosure via specific login error messages related to LDAP authentication.
    *   **Impact:**  Reveals details of used authentication method, aiding attackers in reconnaissance.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Repeated login attempts to generate errors.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** The ability to attempt login to the application
*   **Equation signs are not masked by default on data export:**
    *  **Weakness:** Information disclosure.
    *  **Impact:**  Exported data might contain sensitive information due to equation signs not being properly masked.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Exporting survey data, the unmasked equation signs could expose sensitive information.
    *  **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to export the survey data.
*   **CSRF cookie missing HTTP only parameter:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Missing HttpOnly flag on CSRF cookie.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows client-side scripts (JavaScript) to access the CSRF token cookie, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, enabling CSRF attacks even if XSS occurs.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting an XSS vulnerability to obtain the CSRF cookie.
    *  **Attacker Capability:** Requires ability to execute JavaScript in user's browser.
*   **Admin user without permissions can still see plugins page:**
    *  **Weakness:**  Authorization bypass.
    *  **Impact:** Users with insufficient permissions are able to view the plugins page.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  Simply accessing the plugins page as an admin without proper permissions.
    *  **Attacker Capability:**  Requires administrator access to the application.
*   **Admin user with settings permissions can run integrity check:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Authorization bypass.
    *  **Impact:**  Users with limited permissions are able to trigger the integrity check, which might expose sensitive system information or allow unintended operations.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  Admin user with settings permissions running the integrity check.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires administrator access with settings permissions to the application.
*   **Admin user with limited permissions can view/update/delete reserved menu entries:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Authorization bypass.
    *   **Impact:**  Users with insufficient permissions could modify critical system menu entries, potentially leading to application instability or unauthorized changes.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Accessing and attempting to modify menu entries as an admin with insufficient permissions.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires administrator access to the application.
*   **Admin user can mark other user notification as read:**
    *   **Weakness:** Authorization bypass.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could mark the notifications of other users as read, effectively suppressing those notifications.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Accessing and modifying notification data of other users.
    *   **Attacker Capability:**  Requires administrator access to the application.
*   **Database backup uses browser cache:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Caching of sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Browser caching of database backups might inadvertently expose sensitive database information in local cache.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting the browser cache.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires local access to the user's browser cache.
*  **Browser cache used for exports:**
    *   **Weakness:**  Caching of sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Browser caching of exports may inadvertently expose sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the browser cache
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires local access to the user's browser cache.
*   **Stored XSS vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to store malicious scripts which get executed when other users access the stored content.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Storing malicious scripts.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to store malicious data in the application, likely through a compromised administrative function.
*   **Reflected XSS vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser via manipulating user inputs or URL parameters.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts via user input or URL parameters.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to inject the malicious code via user input or URL parameters.
*   **Survey upload self-reflecting XSS:**
    *   **Weakness:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to upload malicious surveys that, when imported, could execute malicious scripts in the context of other users' browsers.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Uploading a malicious survey file to the system.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to upload survey files to the system.
*   **Submitting empty menu entry crashes application (Application Denial of Service):**
    * **Weakness:**  Denial of Service vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker could potentially crash the application by submitting an empty menu entry.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Submitting empty menu entries.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires ability to make changes to the menu structure

**Summary**
The commit addresses multiple security vulnerabilities in LimeSurvey including several XSS vulnerabilities, authorization bypass issues, information disclosure vulnerabilities and other security related issues. The commit also patches a denial of service vulnerability.
