      "root_cause": "Brocade Fabric OS versions prior to v7.4.2f, v8.2.2a, v8.1.2j and v8.2.1d are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen using certain CLI commands in which a password, common secret or authentication key is given as a command line option, the argument provided with the command line option can be captured and saved in the switch CLI History or Audit Log.",
