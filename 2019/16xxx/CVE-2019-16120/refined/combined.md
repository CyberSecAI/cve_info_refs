## FAQ

### Are there any troubleshooting steps I should try before I post a new thread in the support forum?

First, make sure that you’re running the latest version of Event Tickets. If you’ve got any other add-ons, make sure those are current and running the latest code as well. Also be sure to check our [knowledgebase](https://evnt.is/1aoc).

The most common issues we see are either plugin or theme conflicts. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just Event Tickets is running on your site. If the issue persists, revert to the default [Twenty Twenty](https://evnt.is/1b5j) theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you’ll know that is the source of the conflict.

Note that we aren’t going to say “tough luck” if you identify a plugin/theme conflict. While we can’t guarantee 100% integration with any plugin or theme out there, we will do our best (and reach out the plugin/theme author as needed) to figure out a solution that benefits everyone.

### I’m still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Free plugin users can post in the [Event Tickets support forum on WordPress.org](https://evnt.is/1ac3). Our team reviews that forum weekly to look for bug reports.

If you’re already an [Event Tickets Plus](https://evnt.is/18wk) subscriber, you’re entitled to our actively-monitored [Premium Support](https://evnt.is/1aoe) on our website. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all premium support tickets within 24 hours during the business week.

### What’s the difference between Event Tickets and Events Tickets Plus?

Event Tickets is our free ticketing plugin that has all the basics you need to sell tickets and collect RSVPs on your website. You can use Event Tickets with or without The Events Calendar.

[Event Tickets Plus](https://evnt.is/18wk) is a premium plugin that runs alongside Event Tickets and enhances it with extra features, including custom registration fields, shortcodes, WooCommerce integration, enhanced Stripe functionality for Stripe for Tickets Commerce, our [mobile ticketing app](https://evnt.is/1aof) and more.

[Read more to learn which plugin is right for you.](https://evnt.is/1aoa)

### Do I need The Events Calendar to run Event Tickets?

Nope! Event Tickets works with or without The Events Calendar. Even if you don’t have The Events Calendar, you can create RSVPs and tickets on WordPress pages and posts.

### Can I email attendees using Event Tickets?

Yes. Event Tickets automatically sends an email confirmation after attendees register or RSVP for an event. If the attendee purchases a ticket, the confirmation email will also provide a ticket to scan at the door for admission.

### What add-ons are available for Event Tickets, and where can I read more about them?

The following add-ons are available for The Events Calendar:

* [Events Calendar Pro](https://evnt.is/18wi), for adding premium calendar features like recurring events, advanced views, cool widgets, [shortcodes](https://evnt.is/1ajw), additional fields, virtual events including Zoom integration, video, livestream embed and more!
* [Event Aggregator](https://evnt.is/197u), a service that effortlessly fills your calendar with events from Meetup, Google Calendar, iCalendar, Eventbrite, CSV, and ICS.

I had a problem with an event that I’d created, which was solved – but this isn’t what this is about. I’d mentioned something to Paul, who was helping me, and he asked me to show him. I did, and after a scary-short time (because I was wondering about it for weeks) he sent the solution. It never occurred to me to ask about it, for some weird reason, but after that if it’s not perfect I’ll ask, because with their help it will be!

Support was great. Not as fast as I’d like, but still efficient and available. They handled our request effectively and gave us alternative solutions which were better than what we had in mind

People seem to demand premium services for free, without even investing a minimal effort on their side. If you just spend a bit of time to go through their very thorough docs and kb articles, the features offered in this free plugin surpass many other paid solutions. Thanks for this!

# Exploit Title: WordPress Plugin Event Tickets >= 4.10.7.1 - CSV Injection
# Google Dork: inurl:"\wp-content\plugins\event-tickets"
# Date: 09-01-2019
# Exploit Author: MTK (http://mtk911.cf/)
# Vendor Homepage: https://tri.be/
# Software Link: https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/event-tickets.4.10.7.1.zip
# Version: Up to v4.107.1
# Tested on: Apache2/WordPress 5.2.2 - Firefox/Windows

# Software description:
Event Tickets provides a simple way for visitors to RSVP or purchase tickets to your events. As a standalone plugin, it enables you to add RSVPs or tickets to posts or pages. When paired with The Events Calendar, you can add that same functionality directly to your event listings.

# Technical Details & Impact:
It's possible to run malicious command on logged in user computer. Even though an alert message is shown on opening the file but users usually ignore such pop-ups since file is from known source.

# POC

1. 	Visit RSVP ticket enabled page
2.	In Full name section add payload for CSV injection e.g.
=cmd|'/C ping -t 127.0.0.1'!A0
3.	Login into WordPress and visit event details in All Post> Ticketed > Attendees.
4.	Export Attendees list (.csv format).
5.	Opening the file will execute malicious payload (command) on user system

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
