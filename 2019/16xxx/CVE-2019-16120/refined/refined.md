Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the Exploit-DB entry, which seems relevant to CVE-2019-16120 even though the CVE is not mentioned.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the Event Tickets plugin, specifically when handling attendee names during RSVP or ticket purchase. This allows a malicious payload to be injected within the CSV export data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSV injection vulnerability: The plugin doesn't properly sanitize or escape data when exporting attendee information to a CSV file. This makes it possible to insert formulas into the CSV, which can be interpreted as commands when opened by a user in a spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) on the user's machine: When the attacker injects a formula like '=cmd|'/C ping -t 127.0.0.1'!A0' into a CSV entry, the user opening the CSV file may unknowingly trigger a system command on their own machine. This can lead to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious actions depending on the specific payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts an RSVP form or a ticket purchase with malicious input in the "Full Name" field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit an RSVP or purchase a ticket and input text. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The user must export the attendee list and open the file with software that executes the command.
