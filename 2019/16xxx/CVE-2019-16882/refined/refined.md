Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `string-interner` crate where cloning an interner does not properly clone the underlying strings. Instead, the cloned interner retains raw pointers that still point to the original interner's string storage. When the original interner is dropped, the memory containing these strings is freed, leaving the cloned interner with dangling pointers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The cloned interner attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated.
- **Dangling Pointers:** The cloned interner holds dangling pointers, which are pointers to memory that has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read the contents of the freed memory, which might contain sensitive data.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly stated, use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes lead to further exploitation such as arbitrary code execution.
- **Brute force attack to read memory:** An attacker can try to read the memory pointed by the dangling pointer through brute force.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered by cloning an interner, dropping the original, and then attempting to access interned strings via the clone.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to clone a vulnerable `string-interner` instance, drop the original, and then access data through the cloned instance.
- This could be triggered within any application using the vulnerable versions of the `string-interner` crate.

**Technical Details:**
- The `string-interner` crate's `StringInterner` type stores interned strings using raw pointers. The `Clone` implementation does not perform a deep copy, leading to the use-after-free.
- The vulnerability occurs because the `Clone` implementation of the interner type does not copy the underlying strings that it is interning.
- The issue is triggered when `get_or_intern` or `get` is called on a clone after the original is dropped.
- The fix was to implement `Clone` manually to ensure proper cloning of the strings.

**Affected versions:**
- Versions >= 0.7.0 and < 0.7.1
- Versions < 0.6.4

**Patched versions:**
