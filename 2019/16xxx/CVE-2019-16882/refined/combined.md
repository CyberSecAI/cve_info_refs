## Affected versions

>= 0.7.0, < 0.7.1
< 0.6.4

## Patched versions

## Description

Affected versions of this crate did not clone contained strings when an interner is cloned. Interners have raw pointers to the contained strings, and they keep pointing the strings which the old interner owns, after the interner is cloned. If a new cloned interner is alive and the old original interner is dead, the new interner has dangling pointers to the old interner's storage, which is already dropped.

This allows an attacker to read the already freed memory. The dangling pointers are used by the interners to check a string is already interned. An attacker can do brute force attack to get the data pointed by the dangling pointer.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate did not clone contained strings when an interner is cloned.
Interners have raw pointers to the contained strings, and they keep pointing the strings which the old interner owns, after the interner is cloned.
If a new cloned interner is alive and the old original interner is dead, the new interner has dangling pointers to the old interner's storage, which is already dropped.

This allows an attacker to read the already freed memory.
The dangling pointers are used by the interners to check a string is already interned.
An attacker can do brute force attack to get the data pointed by the dangling pointer.

The flaw was corrected by <https://github.com/Robbepop/string-interner/pull/10>.
This patch implements `Clone` manually to the interner type, so that the internal raw pointers always point the strings owned by the same interner.

PR #10 was also backported to the 0.6 release line in
<https://github.com/Robbepop/string-interner/pull/14> and was released in 0.6.4.

A data structure to cache strings efficiently, with minimal memory footprint and the ability to assicate
the interned strings with unique symbols.
These symbols allow for constant time comparisons and look-ups to the underlying interned string contents.
Also, iterating through the interned strings is cache efficient.

## Contributing

### Testing

Test the project using

```
cargo test --release

```

### Memory Allocation Tests

To further test memory consumption and allocations performed by the
different string interner backends test the project as follows:

```
cargo test --release --features test-allocations -- --test-threads 1

```

* The `--features test-allocations` enables the memory allocations tests.
* The `--test-thread 1` argument is required for the memory allocations tests
  since otherwise they interfere with each other causing them to randomly fail.
* Use `--nocapture` to receive verbose output useful for debugging.

### Profiling & Benchmarks

Benchmark the string interner and its various backends using

```
cargo bench

```

## Description

![@lo48576](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1246590?u=0c512beff1a4ecae2ff6522d15dfff7064e70f16&v=4&size=48)[lo48576](https://github.com/lo48576)opened [on Aug 24, 2019](https://github.com/Robbepop/string-interner/issues/9#issue-484830702)
# Abstract

By steps below, call to `StringInterner::get_or_intern()` and `StringInterner::get()` cause **use after free** in `string-interner 0.7.0`.

1. Create a `StringInterner`. I'll call it `old`.
2. Intern some string.
3. Clone `old`. I'll call the newly created interner `old`.
   * `let new = old.clone();`.
4. Drop `old`.
   * At this point, all `Box<str>`s in `old.values` is also going to be dropped.
5. Call `new.get_or_intern()` or `new.get()`, passing same string as before.
   * These functions refer `Box<str>` strings already dropped. This is UB.

# Code to reproduce

```
// `string-interner = "=0.7.0"` in Cargo.toml.
use string_interner::{DefaultStringInterner, Sym};

fn clone_and_drop() -> (DefaultStringInterner, Sym) {
    let mut old = DefaultStringInterner::new();
    let foo = old.get_or_intern("foo");

    let new = old.clone();
    let _bar = old.get_or_intern("bar");

    (new, foo)
}

fn main() {
    let (mut new, foo) = clone_and_drop();
    assert_eq!(
        new.get_or_intern("foo"),
        foo,
        "`foo` should represent the string \"foo\" so they should be equal"
    );
}
```

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling string-interner-unsoundness-test v0.1.0 (/home/lo48576/works/public/playground/rust/string-interner-unsoundness-test)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33s
     Running `target/debug/string-interner-unsoundness-test`
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: `(left == right)`
  left: `Sym(2)`,
 right: `Sym(1)`: `foo` should represent the string "foo" so they should be equal', src/main.rs:15:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
$

```

The last `assert_eq!` should never fail, but it failed in my environment.

(This is UB so it might success coincidentally...)

See <https://github.com/lo48576/string-interner/blob/5bb5485c8479b2bfb40d83758c0db56f8f466efe/TEST_RESULT.md> for more detailed explanation.
