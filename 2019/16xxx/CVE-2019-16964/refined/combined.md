# FusionPBX Sofia API command injection 1/2

A system command can be passed to FreeSwitch Sofia API in URL argument cmd of the page app/call\_centers/cmd.php.

As part of the Call Center Queue Module in FusionPBX up to v4.5.7 suffers from a command injection vulnerability due to a lack of input validation, which allows authenticated attackers (with at least permissions call\_center\_queue\_add or call\_center\_queue\_edit) to execute any commands on the host as www-data.

Bug ID: <https://www.fusionpbx.com/app/tickets/ticket_edit.php?id=8834a501-3a18-429a-aa84-192dc01e66c7>

Fix: <https://github.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx/commit/2f9e591a4034c3aea70185dcab837946096449bf>

Issue was reported by Pierre Jourdan on 15/08/2019 and fixed same day on 4.4 and master branches by Mark J Crane.

CVE published, NVD base score is 8.8 **HIGH**:
