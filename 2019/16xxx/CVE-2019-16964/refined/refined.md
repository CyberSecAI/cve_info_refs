Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16964:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `cmd.php` file within the Call Center Queue Module of FusionPBX. Specifically, the `cmd` URL parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in a system command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary system commands through the `cmd` URL parameter, which is then executed by the FreeSwitch Sofia API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system with the privileges of the `www-data` user. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `app/call_centers/cmd.php` page. The malicious command is injected through the `cmd` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** Attackers need to be authenticated to the FusionPBX system and must have either `call_center_queue_add` or `call_center_queue_edit` permissions. This indicates that the attacker needs to be a valid user with specific privileges in the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit diff shows the fix, which includes validating the `cmd` variable to only allow specific commands ("load", "unload", "reload") and validating the queue parameter to be a uuid.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Pierre Jourdan and fixed by Mark J Crane on the same day.
* The NVD base score for this CVE is 8.8 (HIGH).

**In summary, this vulnerability is a command injection flaw in FusionPBX that allows authenticated users with specific privileges to execute arbitrary system commands via a crafted HTTP GET request.**
