Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-16279:

*   **Vulnerability:** Missing header count functionality in the `http_header_comp()` function.
*   **Root cause:** The `http_header_comp()` function in nostromo web server did not properly count the number of headers received in an HTTP request.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation and header counting.
*   **Attack vector:** Transmitting more headers than the server is configured to accept in an HTTP request.
*   **Impact:** Buffer overflow in the header array, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves adding the missing header count functionality to the `http_header_comp()` function. Now, the transmission of too many headers will result in an HTTP 413 response. The connection is closed after sending the 413 response.
