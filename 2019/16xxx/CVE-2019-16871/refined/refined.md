- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ADS (Automation Device Specification) protocol was not designed with security in mind and lacks encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Lack of encryption allows eavesdropping and manipulation of ADS packets.
    - An attacker with ADS access can forge arbitrary packets.
    - An attacker with ADS access can potentially use various local services.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can eavesdrop, manipulate, and forge arbitrary ADS packets. An attacker who gains access via ADS could also use local services.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through network access to the ADS protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to observe legitimate ADS traffic and have access to the ADS protocol.
