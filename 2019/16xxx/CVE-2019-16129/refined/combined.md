Subject: CVE-2019-16127, CVE-2019-16128 and CVE-2019-16129 for Microchip code

Hello,

we've published a set of advisories for three vulnerabilities affecting
open source code offered by Microchip. This code is part of SDKs
used to build firmware for Microchip's microcontrollers.
All three of these issues were identified last year
by George Poulios of CENSUS.

1. CVE-2019-16127:
<https://census-labs.com/news/2020/10/21/microchip-asf4-integer-overflows-in-flash_read-flash_write-and-flash_append/>

This is an integer overflow that may occur while calculating
the desired range in flash memory to read / write. It may allow
an adversary to bypass any checks made by the firmware regarding
readable/writable ranges in flash memory. The vulnerable code
is part of the Hardware Abstraction Layer of the "ASF4" SDK
and so it can be found on many different devices with
different flash memory hardware.

Microchip/Atmel still distributes the vulnerable version of the
code through the start.atmel.com "web configurator" service.

2. CVE-2019-16128:
<https://census-labs.com/news/2020/10/21/microchip-cryptoauthlib-atcab_sign_base-buffer-overflow/>

This is a buffer overflow that may occur when a microcontroller
processes the response of a Microchip cryptographic co-processor
like ATECC608A. To drive the co-processor the "cryptoauthlib"
library is used. The library performs a memcpy() operation
to copy a crypto co-processor generated signature into a
firmware buffer. However, the number (and content) of bytes copied
is fully controllable by someone meddling with the data
arriving at the microcontroller.

Version "20191122" of cryptoauthlib addresses this issue.

3. CVE-2019-16129:
<https://census-labs.com/news/2020/10/21/microchip-cryptoauthlib-atcab_genkey_base-buffer-overflow/>

This is similar to CVE-2019-16128. On devices using cryptoauthlib
to control a Microchip cryptographic co-processor, it is possible
to cause a buffer overflow on the MCU by meddling with the data
returned by the co-processor to the MCU during the generation of a
public / private key-pair on the co-processor.

Version "20191122" of cryptoauthlib addresses this issue.

Kind regards,

Dimitris

# Microchip cryptoauthlib atcab\_genkey\_base buffer overflow

| CENSUS ID: | CENSUS-2020-0004 |
| --- | --- |
| CVE ID: | [CVE-2019-16129](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16129) |
| Affected Products: | [cryptoauthlib](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib) versions prior to "20191122" |
| Class: | Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')([CWE-120](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)) |
| Discovered by: | George Poulios |

CENSUS identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in the atcab\_genkey\_base function of the [cryptoauthlib](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib) library. This library is part
of the standard SDK provided by Microchip and is used to drive the operation of cryptographic
co-processors sold by the vendor, such as the [ATECC608A](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATECC608A). An attacker with physical access to
an embedded device where a microcontroller unit executes a vulnerable version of this library,
may be able to execute arbitrary code on the microcontroller, by supplying malicious input
to the microcontroller. Affected manufacturers of embedded systems that use Microchip
cryptographic co-processors, are strongly recommended to update to at least version
"20191122" of the "cryptoauthlib" library.

## Vulnerability Details During the security assessment of an embedded device bearing the Microchip [ATSAMD51J20A](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMD51J20A) microcontroller unit and the Microchip [ATECC608A](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATECC608A) cryptographic co-processor, CENSUS identified that the microcontroller firmware was vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. Specifically, the firmware of the microcontroller unit used the [cryptoauthlib](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib) library function atcab\_genkey\_base to generate a public/private key pair in the cryptographic co-processor. The "cryptoauthlib" library is part of the Microchip SDK and is the standard mechanism by which one drives the operation of cryptographic co-processors of Microchip. CENSUS spotted an inconsistency between the documentation and the implementation of atcab\_genkey\_base (see cryptoauthlib/lib/basic/atca\_basic\_genkey.c). The function will call atGenKey and atca\_execute\_command to perform public/private key generation on the cryptographic processor. The public key will then be transferred to the "public\_key" buffer by means of a call to memcpy. ``` ATCA_STATUS atcab_genkey_base(uint8_t mode, uint16_t key_id, const uint8_t* other_data, uint8_t* public_key) { ATCAPacket packet; ATCACommand ca_cmd = _gDevice->mCommands; ATCA_STATUS status = ATCA_GEN_FAIL; do { // Build GenKey command packet.param1 = mode; packet.param2 = key_id; if (other_data) { memcpy(packet.data, other_data, GENKEY_OTHER_DATA_SIZE); } if ((status = atGenKey(ca_cmd, &packet)) != ATCA_SUCCESS) { break; } if ((status = atca_execute_command(&packet, _gDevice)) != ATCA_SUCCESS) { break; } if (public_key && packet.data[ATCA_COUNT_IDX] > 4) { 82: memcpy(public_key, &packet.data[ATCA_RSP_DATA_IDX], packet.data[ATCA_COUNT_IDX] - 3); } } while (0); return status; } ``` Although the documentation states that the buffer for the returned public key should be 64 bytes, in line 82 the size of the memcpy operation is determined by the packet received. This packet is expected to come from the cryptographic co-processor, however an attacker with physical access to the device can inject such a packet with contents of their choosing on the bus. As the attacker freely controls the packet.data[ATCA\_COUNT\_IDX] value it is possible to influence the number of bytes copied in the memcpy operation. Any packet.data[ATCA\_COUNT\_IDX] value greater than 67 will cause a buffer overflow to occur on the "public\_key" buffer. Moreover, any value greater than 195 will also cause uninitialized data to be copied as well. Depending on the context of the software using "cryptoauthlib" it may be possible for the adversary to corrupt important variables used in security controls, hijack the execution workflow, or disclose information found in the stack / heap (depending on where packet.data is stored). The issue has been verified to affect version "20190517" of cryptoauthlib. Recommendation The vulnerability has been patched in version "20191122" of the "cryptoauthlib" library. Affected manufacturers of embedded systems that use Microchip cryptographic co-processors are strongly recommended to upgrade to at least this version of the "cryptoauthlib" library.

# CryptoAuthLib - Microchip CryptoAuthentication Library {#mainpage}

## Introduction

This library implements the APIs required to communicate with Microchip Security
device. The family of devices supported currently are:

| CryptoAuth | CryptoAuth2 |
| --- | --- |
| [ATECC608B](https://www.microchip.com/ATECC608B) | [ECC204](https://www.microchip.com/ECC204) |
| [ATECC608A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC608A) | [ECC206](https://www.microchip.com/ECC206) |
| [ATECC508A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC508A) | [SHA104](https://www.microchip.com/SHA104) |
| [ATECC108A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC108A) | [SHA105](https://www.microchip.com/SHA105) |
| [ATSHA204A](http://www.microchip.com/ATSHA204A) | [SHA106](https://www.microchip.com/SHA106) |
| [ATSHA206A](https://www.microchip.com/ATSHA206A) | [RNG90](https://www.microchip.com/RNG90) |

The best place to start is with the [Microchip Trust Platform](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform)

Online API documentation is at <https://microchiptech.github.io/cryptoauthlib/>

Latest software and examples can be found at:

* <https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform>
* <http://www.microchip.com/SWLibraryWeb/product.aspx?product=CryptoAuthLib>

Prerequisite hardware to run CryptoAuthLib examples:

* [CryptoAuth Trust Platform Development Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320118)

Alternatively a Microchip MCU and Adapter Board:

* [ATSAMR21 Xplained Pro](http://www.microchip.com/atsamr21-xpro)
  or [ATSAMD21 Xplained Pro](http://www.microchip.com/ATSAMD21-XPRO)
* [CryptoAuthentication SOIC Socket Board](http://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails.aspx?partno=at88ckscktsoic-xpro)
  to accept SOIC parts
* [ATECC608B mikroBUS evaluation board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/DT100104)
* [ECC204 mikroBUS evaluation board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev92r58a)
* [SHA104/SHA105 mikroBUS evaluation board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev97m19a)
* [TA010 mikroBUS evaluation board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV74C12A)

For most development, using socketed top-boards is preferable until your
configuration is well tested, then you can commit it to a CryptoAuth Xplained
Pro Extension, for example. Keep in mind that once you lock a device, it will
not be changeable.

## Examples

* Install the [Trust Platform Design Suite](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/security/trust-platform) to access Use Case examples
  for the different Security Solutions (ATECC608, SHA104/105, ECC204, TA010, TA100…)

## Configuration

In order to properly configured the library there must be a header file in your
project named `atca_config.h` at minimum this needs to contain defines for the
hal and device types being used. Most integrations have an configuration mechanism
for generating this file. See the [atca\_config.h.in](/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib/blob/main/lib/atca_config.h.in) template
which is configured by CMake for Linux, MacOS, & Windows projects.

An example of the configuration:

```
/* Cryptoauthlib Configuration File */
#ifndef ATCA_CONFIG_H
#define ATCA_CONFIG_H

/* Include HALS */
#define ATCA_HAL_I2C

/* Included device support */
#define ATCA_ATECC608_SUPPORT

/* \brief How long to wait after an initial wake failure for the POST to
 *         complete.
 * If Power-on self test (POST) is enabled, the self test will run on waking
 * from sleep or during power-on, which delays the wake reply.
 */
#ifndef ATCA_POST_DELAY_MSEC
#define ATCA_POST_DELAY_MSEC 25
#endif

#endif // ATCA_CONFIG_H

```

There are two major compiler defines that affect the operation of the library.

* ATCA\_NO\_POLL can be used to revert to a non-polling mechanism for device
  responses. Normally responses are polled for after sending a command,
  giving quicker response times. However, if ATCA\_NO\_POLL is defined, then
  the library will simply delay the max execution time of a command before
  reading the response.
* ATCA\_NO\_HEAP can be used to remove the use of malloc/free from the main
  library. This can be helpful for smaller MCUs that don't have a heap
  implemented. If just using the basic API, then there shouldn't be any code
  changes required. The lower-level API will no longer use the new/delete
  functions and the init/release functions should be used directly.

Some specific options are available in the fully documented configuration files `lib/calib/calib_config.h`,
`atca_configuration.h`, `lib/crypto/crypto_config.h`, `lib/host/atca_host_config.h` which is also the place where features can be selected.
We provide some configurations focused on specific use cases and the checks are enabled by default.

## Release notes

See [Release Notes](/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib/blob/main/release_notes.md)

## Host Device Support

CryptoAuthLib will run on a variety of platforms from small micro-controllers
to desktop host systems. See [hal readme](/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib/blob/main/lib/hal/README.md)

Porting requires a time delay function of millisecond resolution (hal\_delay\_ms) which
can be implemented via loop, timer, or rtos sleep/wait and a communication interface.

## CryptoAuthLib Architecture

Cryptoauthlib API documentation is at <https://microchiptech.github.io/cryptoauthlib/>

The library is structured to support portability to:

* multiple hardware/microcontroller platforms
* multiple environments including bare-metal, RTOS and Windows/Linux/MacOS
* multiple chip communication protocols (I2C, SPI, and SWI)

All platform dependencies are contained within the HAL (hardware abstraction
layer).

## Directory Structure

```
lib - primary library source code
lib/atcacert - certificate data and i/o methods
lib/calib - the Basic Cryptoauth API
lib/crypto - Software crypto implementations external crypto libraries support (primarily SHA1 and SHA2)
lib/hal - hardware abstraction layer code for supporting specific platforms
lib/host - support functions for common host-side calculations
lib/jwt - json web token functions
test - Integration test and examples. See test/cmd-processor.c for main() implementation.

For production code, test directories should be excluded by not compiling it
into a project, so it is up to the developer to include or not as needed.  Test
code adds significant bulk to an application - it's not intended to be included
in production code.

```

## Tests

There is a set of integration tests found in the test directory which will at least
partially demonstrate the use of the objects. Some tests may depend upon a
certain device being configured in a certain way and may not work for all
devices or specific configurations of the device. See [test readme](/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib/blob/main/test/README.md)

# Using CryptoAuthLib (Microchip CryptoAuth Library)

The best place to start is with the [Microchip Trust Platform](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform)

Also application examples are included as part of the Harmony 3 framework and can be copied from the Harmony Content Manager
or found with the Harmony 3 Framework [Cryptoauthlib\_apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/cryptoauthlib_apps)

## Incorporating CryptoAuthLib in a Linux project using USB HID devices

The Linux HID HAL files use the Linux udev development software package.

To install the udev development package under Ubuntu Linux, please type the
following command at the terminal window:

```
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev
```

This adds the udev development development software package to the Ubuntu Linux
installation.

The Linux HID HAL files also require a udev rule to be added to change the
permissions of the USB HID Devices. Please add a new udev rule for the
Microchip CryptoAuth USB devices.

```
cd /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo touch mchp-cryptoauth.rules
```

Edit the mchp-cryptoauth.rules file and add the following line to the file:

```
SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2312", MODE="0666"

```
