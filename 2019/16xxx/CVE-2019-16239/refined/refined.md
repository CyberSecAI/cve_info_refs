  "CVE-2019-16239": {
    "description": "process_http_response in OpenConnect before 8.05 has a Buffer Overflow when a malicious server uses HTTP chunked encoding with crafted chunk sizes.",
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of chunked HTTP encoding within openconnect.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious HTTP server can provide crafted chunk lengths, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially causing a denial-of-service (crash) on the client.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious HTTP server sending crafted chunk lengths in chunked HTTP encoding."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a malicious HTTP server that the vulnerable openconnect client connects to. The attacker also needs to successfully negotiate the initial TLS handshake (if applicable) and be able to provide a server certificate that the client will accept.",
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability exists within the `process_http_response` function of OpenConnect when it parses HTTP responses using chunked transfer encoding. The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious server sending specially crafted chunk lengths. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the client processes these chunks. The attacker has to be in a man-in-the-middle or a malicious VPN server."
