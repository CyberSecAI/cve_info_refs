**Vulnerability:** CVE-2019-16865 - python-pillow: reading specially crafted image files leads to allocation of large amounts of memory and denial of service

*   **Root Cause:** The python-pillow library may allocate a large amount of memory or require a long time while processing specially crafted image files, possibly causing a denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:**  Specifically, code related to reading image files.

More details:
- In `RawDecode.c`, Pillow throws an error if `skip` is calculated to be negative, preventing it from skipping backwards and causing issues.
- Added decompression bomb checks to GIF and ICO formats to prevent memory exhaustion.
- Pillow raises an error if a TIFF dimension is a string, preventing operations being performed on it, and related issues.
