Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-16539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Support Core Plugin did not validate paths submitted for the "Delete Support Bundles" feature. This, combined with a missing permission check on the endpoint, allowed unauthorized file deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Path Traversal:** The plugin failed to validate user-provided paths, allowing deletion of files outside the intended support bundle directory.
2.  **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin's endpoint for deleting support bundles did not enforce proper permission checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could delete arbitrary files on the Jenkins master file system that are accessible by the OS user running Jenkins. This could lead to:
*   **Data Loss:** Deletion of critical system files or configuration data.
*   **Denial of Service:** Deletion of files required for Jenkins to function properly.
*   **System Instability:**  Deleting essential system files could result in system errors.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the "Delete Support Bundles" feature of the Support Core Plugin, accessible over the network through the Jenkins web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Jenkins User Account:** The attacker needs a Jenkins user account with at least Overall/Read permission. This is a low level permission, making it easy to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Knowledge of file paths:** The attacker needs knowledge of the file path to be deleted

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file deletion, not just support bundle related files, if an attacker can guess file paths.
*   The fix restricts deletion to only support bundles and related files listed on the UI and enforces the "Download Bundle" permission for deletion.
*   This vulnerability is identified as SECURITY-1634 in the Jenkins advisory.
