Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-parameterized `INSERT INTO` SQL statement in the `interface/forms/eye_mag/js/eye_base.php` file of OpenEMR. The `providerID` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization on the `providerID` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, which is then executed against the database.
- **Non-parameterized Query:** The direct inclusion of user input into the SQL query is the primary vulnerability, as it bypasses the intended protection offered by parameterized queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Data Extraction:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the OpenEMR database. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates this using `updatexml` to fetch the database version.
- **Potential for other SQL operations:** Beyond data extraction, the injection point could potentially be used to modify data or perform other malicious actions if the database user has the required privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL, specifically by manipulating the `providerID` parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable `eye_base.php` file.
- **Direct manipulation of parameter:** The attacker is able to inject SQL queries directly into the `providerID` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to be an authenticated user of the OpenEMR application, meaning they need to have valid login credentials.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenEMR instance to send the malicious requests.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `providerID` parameter and the structure of the non-parameterized query.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit requires that no entry exists for the `providerID` that is being injected. This is because the injection point also creates a record in the table, so a different provider id must be used for each request.
- The PoC uses `updatexml` to demonstrate data extraction. Other SQL injection techniques could also be used.
- The vulnerability was discovered on September 16, 2019, and fixed in OpenEMR version 5.0.2.1, released on October 10, 2019.
