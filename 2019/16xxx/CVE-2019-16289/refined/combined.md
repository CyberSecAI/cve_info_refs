### How It Works?

#### Example #1

You create a new javascript snippet and add a code you’d like to place on a website. Html snippet editor provides you with tooltips and highlights errors in syntax. Now you need to define where to put a code. For example, you can place the code in header, footer of all pages. This works great for Google Analytics. Create an additional condition: do not show this code to the administrator. It will prevent from tracking user role.

#### Example #2

You create a text snippet and add a repeated text or a template. You can add a shortcode for the contact form, in case it’s universal for all website pages. Now you can add conditions to show this content to registered users only. Save the text snippet and go to editing pages. If you use the Gutenberg editor, you need to select a special unit. For the classic editor, click the icon of our plugin and add a shortcode of your new snippet.

As you can see, working with snippets is super easy!

* Execute shortcodes in snippets – Execute shortcodes in the snippet code before executing the snippet.
* Complete Uninstall – When the plugin is deleted from the Plugins menu, also delete all snippets and plugin settings.
* Support old shortcodes [insert\_php] – If you used our plugin from version 1.3.0, then you could use the old shortcodes [insert\_php][/insert\_php]; from version 2.2.0 we disabled this type of shortcodes by default, as their use is not safe. If you still want to execute your php code via [insert\_php][/insert\_php] shortcodes, you can enable this option.

#### Code Editor

* Code style – The optional feature. You can customize the code style in the snippet editor. The “Default” style is applied by default.
* Indent With Tabs – The optional feature. Whether, when indenting, the first N\*tabSize spaces should be replaced by N tabs. The default is false.
* Tab Size – The optional feature. Pressing Tab in the code editor increases left indent to N spaces. N is a number pre-defined by you.
* Indent Unit – The optional feature. The indent for code lines (units). Example: select a snippet, press Tab. The left indent in the selected code increases to N spaces. N is a number pre-defined by you.
* Wrap Lines – The optional feature. If ON, the editor will wrap long lines. Otherwise, it will create a horizontal scroll.
* Line Numbers – The optional feature. If ON, all lines in the editor will be numbered.
* Auto Close Brackets – The optional feature. If ON, the editor will automatically close opened quotes or brackets. Sometimes, it speeds up coding.
* Highlight Selection Matches – The optional feature. If ON, it searches for matches for the selected variable/function name. Highlight matches with green. Improves readability.

### Use this plugin with care!

ATTENTION! Check your php scripts before inserting on your site. If you don’t understand how the php script you are using works, try to avoid using it. Using unverified or outdated php scripts can damage the security of your site! Using the plugin on multisites can be dangerous as it will allow all administrators to insert php, js code. If you cannot control the work of administrators, we recommend that you do not use this plugin for security reasons. We are constantly working to improve the security of the plugin, but unfortunately we cannot check the code scripts you use that may violate the security of your site!

### History, Developers, Credits

If you are a long-term user, you may be confused about the new plugin update. You’ve been using an old plugin – Insert php 1.3.0, and now got an extended product – Woody Code Snippets. Insert php was the first plugin version to work with PHP code. It was created by Will Bontrager Software, LLC. In 2018, the Webcraftic studio started to actively develop the plugin. We’ve created a roadmap and released several powerful updates that help you to use PHP code more comfortable and secure. Now plugin supports not only PHP but other snippet types as well. We’ve decided to rename the plugin as Woody Code Snippets. This name is more suitable for new and powerful plugin features.

More information about the Insert PHP plugin can be found here:

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
3. Use the PHP Snippets -> Add snippet, to create a new snippet

## FAQ

### How to pass attributes to a snippet using a shortcode?

Add a new attribute “simple” to the shortcode [wbcr\_php\_snippet id=”xx” simple=”example”].

The attribute “simple” is available in the snippet as the $simple variable. The attribute name can contain Latin letters and lowercase digits. You can also use underscore.

### The snippet code executed with an error and I cannot change it, what should I do?

Do not despair! Even an experienced person can make mistakes. We created a secure mode for this case. Go into it and your snippets code will not be executed.

1. Go to the safe mode by this link: http://your-site-name.dev/wp-admin/?wbcr-php-snippets-safe-mode
2. Edit the snippet in which you made a mistake;
3. Leave safe mode by clicking the link: http://your-site-name.dev/wp-admin/?wbcr-php-snippets-disable-safe-mode

Great, now you should not have any issues!

### How to pass page content to a snippet?

Pretty often we’d like to hide a part of a text or a form on particular pages and set up display conditions. You need to wrap the content you’d like to pass to a snippet with shortcodes [wbcr\_php\_snippet id=”xx” simple=”example”]page content[/wbcr\_php\_snippet]. Page content in a snippet is located in the $content variable.

### Does plugin support Gutenberg editor?

Yes, it does. You can add there special blocks from our plugin.

### I used the old plugin Insert php 1.3.0. What should I expect in 2.x.x version?

The old version of Insert php 1.3.0 worked this way: you wrapped PHP code with shortcodes [insert\_php]php code[/insert\_php]. Starting from version 2.x.x and higher, you need to create special snippets to place PHP code. Use a snippet shortcode [wbcr\_php\_snippetid=”xx”] instead of shortcodes [insert\_php][/insert\_php] to execute PHP code on pages.

We recommend you to move all your code from the post editor to snippets.

Important! TinyMCE converts double quotes to special characters. So if you place this code on the snippet editor, it may not work. To avoid this problem, replace all special symbols of double quotes in your PHP code with classic double quotes.

### How long are you planning to support the old version 1.3.0?

60% users have already downloaded 2.x.x version. We are trying to reach the number of 80%. The deadline for support is scheduled for March 1, 2019.

You can download the old plugin version from [here](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/insert-php.1.3.zip).

### I don’t like the new plugin version. How can I roll back to 1.3.0 and don’t get updates?

First of all, please, take some time to actually go through the new version. Usually, it takes a week to see how useful this version may be for you. If you’ve faced any problems or found some bugs, feel free to contact us at our [support forum](http://forum.webcraftic.com).

You can always download the old version (1.3.0) from [here](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/insert-php.1.3.zip).

To avoid getting updates, open the PHP file wp-content/plugins/insert-php/insert\_php.php and change the plugin version to 9.9.9.

### Is there any plugin documentation?

You can find the detailed documentation in [here](https://woodysnippet.com/getting-started-with-woody-ad-snippets/).

### Is plugin compatible with GDPR?

Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with GDPR.

### Can the plugin be completely uninstalled?

Go to the settings page and enable the “Complete uninstall” option. Than, when you delete Woody Code Snippets using the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress it will clean up the database table and a few other bits of data. Be careful not to remove Woody Code Snippets by deleting it from the Plugins menu unless you want this to happen.

### How to remove plugin via ftp client?

You have to delete the folder with the plugin, which is located here: wp-content/plugins/insert-php

This will not clear the plugin data from the database. You have to remove the plugin through the admin panel with the “Full Uninstall” option enabled in order to completely clear the plugin data.

### Will I lose my snippets if I change the theme or upgrade WordPress?

No, the snippets are stored in the WordPress database and are independent of the theme and unaffected by WordPress upgrades.

### Does plugin work with multisite?

The plugin doesn’t support multi-sites.

We will definitely add multisite support in the future. You can speed up this process by leaving a request on our [support forum](http://forum.webcraftic.com).

Few days back I realized that HTML tags stopped working on Free version. <BR> tag written inside double quotes in echo syntax were converting into new line. I realized that the new free version corrupted my entire website as I was using woody code snippet in all my pages.
To recover this damage I purchased Woody code snippet “Basic” lifetime plan (Premium 2022) on 22nd May 2023. This is blunder than free version. Now when I make changes in PHP snippets, it is not saving. I can see the update button but not publish.
I raised this with my premium login but no answer after 3 working days. Wrote so many emails.
Kindly resolve my issue otherwise return my money

I’m so glad I found this plugin. I’ve been using and ad-manager for years. I just deleted my ad-manager, because I can do the same AND MUCH MORE using this plugin. I use Woody code snippets now for all my ads, tracking codes and repeated text. It’s all in one place and it helps keeping my site organized.
The plugin basically uses the same style we’re already used to when writing posts or pages (I still use the classic editor). Title, tags, delete, filters, trash, visual/text editor, bulk actions; it’s all there.
Feature request: multi-author ads (guest writer, revenue share). It would be great if a guest writer could ad his own AdSense Publisher-ID somewhere so that when a post is viewed by someone, ads with that author’s publisher ID is shown to the viewer. I’ve seen this feature in the past in other scripts. As far as I know, this is not against the AdSense TOS.
Thanks for this great plugin!

The free version did everything I needed, but I bought it anyway. Guys, seriously – a universal snippet that allows PHP and JQuery code IN THE SAME SHORTCODE! You outdid yourselves.
Many WP users don’t know that they can insert some simple JQuery to make a small change on a site in 10 seconds. This plugin makes up for the shortcomings of a thousand other plugins.
The “ONLY RUN IF USER ROLE =” IS AMAZING!!! The only other options I know of are manually checking user role with wp PHP functions, bloated, time consuming, etc, or writing a plugin/filter. CRAZY.
I have no words. How developers that are this rational and prudent ended up on WordPress, land of nightmare code is beyond me. and their free version is amazing. Like I said, I only bought it b/c I love them.

#### 2.0.1

Attention! This new 2.0 plugin version, we added the ability to insert php code using snippets. This is a more convenient and secure way than using shortcodes [insert\_php] code execute [/ insert\_php]. However, for compatibility reasons, we left support for [insert\_php] shortcodes, but we will depreciate them in the next versions of the plugin.

We strongly recommend you to transfer your php code to snippets and call them in your posts/pages and widgets using [wbcr\_php\_snippet id = “000”] shortcodes.
