Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-16774

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `phpfastcache` cookie driver handled deserialization of data stored in cookies. Specifically, it was using `json_decode` on the cookie data, but subsequently passing this decoded data to a `decode` function which was performing a PHP `unserialize()` operation. This allowed for arbitrary object injection via a crafted cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Object Injection:** The primary weakness is the usage of `unserialize()` on user-supplied data that was not properly sanitized, allowing for object injection.
* **Insecure Deserialization:**  The cookie driver was not ensuring the integrity and type of data before deserialization, making it susceptible to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious PHP objects, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the application and server.
* **Data tampering/corruption:** Malicious objects could manipulate or corrupt application data, leading to denial of service or incorrect behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the manipulation of HTTP cookies. An attacker could craft a malicious cookie, and send it to the target application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to set/modify the cookie sent to the server. This is possible for any user who can send an HTTP request to the vulnerable application, or by a man-in-the-middle attacker if the connection is not secured.
* No specific position or privileges are needed, making it easily exploitable over a network.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was present in `phpfastcache` versions prior to 5.0.13.
* The fix was implemented by enforcing JSON conversion when deserializing and removing the extra `decode` method, therefore directly using json_decode's result.
* The vulnerability has been assigned a High severity rating.
