Package        : waitress
Version        : 1.0.1-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16785 CVE-2019-16786 CVE-2019-16789 CVE-2019-16792
                 CVE-2022-24761
Debian Bug     : 1008013

Waitress is a Python WSGI server, an application server for Python web apps.

Security updates to fix request smuggling bugs, when combined with another http
proxy that interprets requests differently. This can lead to a potential for
HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while
the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.  This can result in cache
poisoning or unexpected information disclosure.

CVE-2019-16785

    Only recognise CRLF as a line-terminator, not a plain LF. Before this
    change waitress could see two requests where the front-end proxy only saw
    one.

CVE-2019-16786

    Waitress would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and only look for a
    single string value, if that value was not "chunked" it would fall through
    and use the Content-Length header instead.  This could allow for Waitress
    to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP
    pipelining.

CVE-2019-16789

    Specially crafted requests containing special whitespace characters in the
    Transfer-Encoding header would get parsed by Waitress as being a chunked
    request, but a front-end server would use the Content-Length instead as the
    Transfer-Encoding header is considered invalid due to containing invalid
    characters.  If a front-end server does HTTP pipelining to a backend
    Waitress server this could lead to HTTP request splitting which may lead to
    potential cache poisoning or unexpected information disclosure.

CVE-2019-16792

    If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would
    treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the
    request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.

CVE-2022-24761

    There are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling
    that are addressed by this advisory:
    1. The use of Python's int() to parse strings into integers, leading to +10
       to be parsed as 10, or 0x01 to be parsed as 1, where as the standard
       specifies that the string should contain only digits or hex digits.
    2. Waitress does not support chunk extensions, however it was discarding
       them without validating that they did not contain illegal characters.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.1-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your waitress packages.

For the detailed security status of waitress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/waitress>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Remove support for non CRLF line endings

```
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5> says that servers MAY
implement their parsers to use only the LF as a delimeter between lines,
however if the frontend server does NOT do the same you can potentially
allow a single HTTP request to be treated differently by the two
servers.

This issue can be used to cause HTTP request smuggling or HTTP desync
which may lead to vulnerabilities.

To increase robustness Waitress will no longer allow bare LF for HTTP
messages/headers and chunked encoding and instead now enforces that the
line endings at CRLF.

# Waitress[¶](#waitress "Link to this heading")

Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very
acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones which live in the
Python standard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python
3.9+. It is also known to run on PyPy 3 (Python version 3.9+) on UNIX. It
supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

## Change History[¶](#change-history "Link to this heading")

## 3.0.2 (2024-11-16)[¶](#id1 "Link to this heading")

### Security[¶](#security "Link to this heading")

* When using Waitress to process trusted proxy headers, Waitress will now
  update the headers to drop any untrusted values, thereby making sure that
  WSGI apps only get trusted and validated values that Waitress itself used to
  update the environ. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/452> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/451>

## 3.0.1 (2024-10-28)[¶](#id2 "Link to this heading")

### Backward Incompatibilities[¶](#backward-incompatibilities "Link to this heading")

* Python 3.8 is no longer supported.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/445>.

### Features[¶](#features "Link to this heading")

* Added support for Python 3.13.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/445>.

### Security[¶](#id3 "Link to this heading")

* Fix a bug that would lead to Waitress busy looping on select() on a half-open
  socket due to a race condition that existed when creating a new HTTPChannel.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/435>,
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6>

  With thanks to Dylan Jay and Dieter Maurer for their extensive debugging and
  helping track this down.
* No longer strip the header values before passing them to the WSGI environ.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/434> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/432>
* Fix a race condition in Waitress when channel\_request\_lookahead is enabled
  that could lead to HTTP request smuggling.

  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-9298-4cf8-g4wj>

## 3.0.0 (2024-02-04)[¶](#id4 "Link to this heading")

* Rename "master" git branch to "main"
* Fix a bug that would appear on macOS whereby if we accept() a socket that is
  already gone, setting socket options would fail and take down the server. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/399>
* Fixed testing of vendored asyncore code to not rely on particular naming for
  errno's. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/397>
* HTTP Request methods and versions are now validated to meet the HTTP
  standards thereby dropping invalid requests on the floor. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/423>
* No longer close the connection when sending a HEAD request response. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/428>
* Always attempt to send the Connection: close response header when we are
  going to close the connection to let the remote know in more instances.
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/429>
* Python 3.7 is no longer supported. Add support for Python 3.11, 3.12 and
  PyPy 3.9, 3.10. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/412>
* Document that trusted\_proxy may be set to a wildcard value to trust all
  proxies. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/431>

### Updated Defaults[¶](#updated-defaults "Link to this heading")

* clear\_untrusted\_proxy\_headers is set to True by default. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/370>

## 2.1.2[¶](#id5 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfix[¶](#bugfix "Link to this heading")

* When expose\_tracebacks is enabled waitress would fail to properly encode
  unicode thereby causing another error during error handling. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/378>
* Header length checking had a calculation that was done incorrectly when the
  data was received across multple socket reads. This calculation has been
  corrected, and no longer will Waitress send back a 413 Request Entity Too
  Large. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/376>

### Security Bugfix[¶](#security-bugfix "Link to this heading")

* in 2.1.0 a new feature was introduced that allowed the WSGI thread to start
  sending data to the socket. However this introduced a race condition whereby
  a socket may be closed in the sending thread while the main thread is about
  to call select() therey causing the entire application to be taken down.
  Waitress will no longer close the socket in the WSGI thread, instead waking
  up the main thread to cleanup. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377>

## 2.1.1[¶](#id6 "Link to this heading")

### Security Bugfix[¶](#id7 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress now validates that chunked encoding extensions are valid, and don't
  contain invalid characters that are not allowed. They are still skipped/not
  processed, but if they contain invalid data we no longer continue in and
  return a 400 Bad Request. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request
  smuggling. Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36>
* Waitress now validates that the chunk length is only valid hex digits when
  parsing chunked encoding, and values such as `0x01` and `+01` are no
  longer supported. This stops potential HTTP desync/HTTP request smuggling.
  Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36>
* Waitress now validates that the Content-Length sent by a remote contains only
  digits in accordance with RFC7230 and will return a 400 Bad Request when the
  Content-Length header contains invalid data, such as `+10` which would
  previously get parsed as `10` and accepted. This stops potential HTTP
  desync/HTTP request smuggling Thanks to Zhang Zeyu for reporting this issue. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36>

## 2.1.0[¶](#id8 "Link to this heading")

### Python Version Support[¶](#python-version-support "Link to this heading")

* Python 3.6 is no longer supported by Waitress
* Python 3.10 is fully supported by Waitress

### Bugfix[¶](#id9 "Link to this heading")

* `wsgi.file_wrapper` now sets the `seekable`, `seek`, and `tell`
  attributes from the underlying file if the underlying file is seekable. This
  allows WSGI middleware to implement things like range requests for example

  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/359> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/363>
* In Python 3 `OSError` is no longer subscriptable, this caused failures on
  Windows attempting to loop to find an socket that would work for use in the
  trigger.

  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/361>
* Fixed an issue whereby `BytesIO` objects were not properly closed, and
  thereby would not get cleaned up until garbage collection would get around to
  it.

  This led to potential for random memory spikes/memory issues, see
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/358> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/357> .

  With thanks to Florian Schulze for testing/vaidating this fix!

### Features[¶](#id10 "Link to this heading")

* When the WSGI app starts sending data to the output buffer, we now attempt to
  send data directly to the socket. This avoids needing to wake up the main
  thread to start sending data. Allowing faster transmission of the first byte.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/364>

  With thanks to Michael Merickel for being a great rubber ducky!
* Add REQUEST\_URI to the WSGI environment.

  REQUEST\_URI is similar to `request_uri` in nginx. It is a string that
  contains the request path before separating the query string and
  decoding `%`-escaped characters.

## 2.0.0 (2021-03-07)[¶](#id11 "Link to this heading")

### Friendly Reminder[¶](#friendly-reminder "Link to this heading")

This release still contains a variety of deprecation notices about defaults
that can be set for a variety of options.

Please note that this is your last warning, and you should update your
configuration if you do NOT want to use the new defaults.

See the arguments documentation page for all supported options, and pay
attention to the warnings:

<https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/arguments.html>

Without further ado, here's a short list of great changes thanks to our
contributors!

### Bugfixes/Features[¶](#bugfixes-features "Link to this heading")

* Fix a crash on startup when listening to multiple interfaces.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/332>
* Waitress no longer attempts to guess at what the `server_name` should be for
  a listen socket, instead it always use a new adjustment/argument named
  `server_name`.

  Please see the documentation for `server_name` in
  <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/arguments.html> and
  see <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/329>
* Allow tasks to notice if the client disconnected.

  This inserts a callable `waitress.client_disconnected` into the environment
  that allows the task to check if the client disconnected while waiting for
  the response at strategic points in the execution and to cancel the
  operation.

  It requires setting the new adjustment `channel_request_lookahead` to a value
  larger than 0, which continues to read requests from a channel even if a
  request is already being processed on that channel, up to the given count,
  since a client disconnect is detected by reading from a readable socket and
  receiving an empty result.

  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/310>
* Drop Python 2.7 and 3.5 support
* The server now issues warning output when it there are enough open
  connections (controlled by "connection\_limit"), that it is no longer
  accepting new connections. This situation was previously difficult to
  diagnose.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/322>

## 1.4.4 (2020-06-01)[¶](#id12 "Link to this heading")

* Fix an issue with keep-alive connections in which memory usage was higher
  than expected because output buffers were being reused across requests on
  a long-lived connection and each buffer would not be freed until it was full
  or the connection was closed. Buffers are now rotated per-request to
  stabilize their behavior.

  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/300>
* Waitress threads have been updated to contain their thread number. This will
  allow loggers that use that information to print the thread that the log is
  coming from.

  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/302>

## 1.4.3 (2020-02-02)[¶](#id13 "Link to this heading")

### Security Fixes[¶](#security-fixes "Link to this heading")

* In Waitress version 1.4.2 a new regular expression was added to validate the
  headers that Waitress receives to make sure that it matches RFC7230.
  Unfortunately the regular expression was written in a way that with invalid
  input it leads to catastrophic backtracking which allows for a Denial of
  Service and CPU usage going to a 100%.

  This was reported by Fil Zembowicz to the Pylons Project. Please see
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-73m2-3pwg-5fgc>
  for more information.

## 1.4.2 (2020-01-02)[¶](#id14 "Link to this heading")

### Security Fixes[¶](#id15 "Link to this heading")

* This is a follow-up to the fix introduced in 1.4.1 to tighten up the way
  Waitress strips whitespace from header values. This makes sure Waitress won't
  accidentally treat non-printable characters as whitespace and lead to a
  potental HTTP request smuggling/splitting security issue.

  Thanks to ZeddYu Lu for the extra test cases.

  Please see the security advisory for more information:
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-m5ff-3wj3-8ph4>

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16789

### Bugfixes[¶](#bugfixes "Link to this heading")

* Updated the regex used to validate header-field content to match the errata
  that was published for RFC7230.

  See: <https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=7230&eid=4189>

## 1.4.1 (2019-12-24)[¶](#id16 "Link to this heading")

### Security Fixes[¶](#id17 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress did not properly validate that the HTTP headers it received were
  properly formed, thereby potentially allowing a front-end server to treat a
  request different from Waitress. This could lead to HTTP request
  smuggling/splitting.

  Please see the security advisory for more information:
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-m5ff-3wj3-8ph4>

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16789

## 1.4.0 (2019-12-20)[¶](#id18 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfixes[¶](#id19 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress used to slam the door shut on HTTP pipelined requests without
  setting the `Connection: close` header as appropriate in the response. This
  is of course not very friendly. Waitress now explicitly sets the header when
  responding with an internally generated error such as 400 Bad Request or 500
  Internal Server Error to notify the remote client that it will be closing the
  connection after the response is sent.
* Waitress no longer allows any spaces to exist between the header field-name
  and the colon. While waitress did not strip the space and thereby was not
  vulnerable to any potential header field-name confusion, it should have sent
  back a 400 Bad Request. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/273>

### Security Fixes[¶](#id20 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress implemented a "MAY" part of the RFC7230
  (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5>) which states:

  > Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is
  > the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line
  > terminator and ignore any preceding CR.

  Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF
  the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and
  the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This
  can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress
  may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP
  message.

  For more information I can highly recommend the blog post by ZeddYu Lu
  <https://blog.zeddyu.info/2019/12/08/HTTP-Smuggling-en/>

  Please see the security advisory for more information:
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-pg36-wpm5-g57p>

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16785
* Waitress used to treat LF the same as CRLF in `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`
  requests, while the maintainer doesn't believe this could lead to a security
  issue, this is no longer supported and all chunks are now validated to be
  properly framed with CRLF as required by RFC7230.
* Waitress now validates that the `Transfer-Encoding` header contains only
  transfer codes that it is able to decode. At the moment that includes the
  only valid header value being `chunked`.

  That means that if the following header is sent:

  `Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked`

  Waitress will send back a 501 Not Implemented with an error message stating
  as such, as while Waitress supports `chunked` encoding it does not support
  `gzip` and it is unable to pass that to the underlying WSGI environment
  correctly.

  Waitress DOES NOT implement support for `Transfer-Encoding: identity`
  eventhough `identity` was valid in RFC2616, it was removed in RFC7230.
  Please update your clients to remove the `Transfer-Encoding` header if the
  only transfer coding is `identity` or update your client to use
  `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` instead of `Transfer-Encoding: identity,
  chunked`.

  Please see the security advisory for more information:
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-g2xc-35jw-c63p>

  CVE-ID: CVE-2019-16786
* While validating the `Transfer-Encoding` header, Waitress now properly
  handles line-folded `Transfer-Encoding` headers or those that contain
  multiple comma seperated values. This closes a potential issue where a
  front-end server may treat the request as being a chunked request (and thus
  ignoring the Content-Length) and Waitress using the Content-Length as it was
  looking for the single value `chunked` and did not support comma seperated
  values.
* Waitress used to explicitly set the Content-Length header to 0 if it was
  unable to parse it as an integer (for example if the Content-Length header
  was sent twice (and thus folded together), or was invalid) thereby allowing
  for a potential request to be split and treated as two requests by HTTP
  pipelining support in Waitress. If Waitress is now unable to parse the
  Content-Length header, a 400 Bad Request is sent back to the client.

  Please see the security advisory for more information:
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppp-gpcr-7qf6>

## 1.3.1 (2019-08-27)[¶](#id21 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfixes[¶](#id22 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress won't accidentally throw away part of the path if it starts with a
  double slash (`GET //testing/whatever HTTP/1.0`). WSGI applications will
  now receive a `PATH_INFO` in the environment that contains
  `//testing/whatever` as required. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/260> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/261>

## 1.3.0 (2019-04-22)[¶](#id23 "Link to this heading")

### Deprecations[¶](#deprecations "Link to this heading")

* The `send_bytes` adjustment now defaults to `1` and is deprecated
  pending removal in a future release.
  and <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/246>

### Features[¶](#id24 "Link to this heading")

* Add a new `outbuf_high_watermark` adjustment which is used to apply
  backpressure on the `app_iter` to avoid letting it spin faster than data
  can be written to the socket. This stabilizes responses that iterate quickly
  with a lot of data.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/242>
* Stop early and close the `app_iter` when attempting to write to a closed
  socket due to a client disconnect. This should notify a long-lived streaming
  response when a client hangs up.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/238>
  and <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/240>
  and <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/241>
* Adjust the flush to output `SO_SNDBUF` bytes instead of whatever was
  set in the `send_bytes` adjustment. `send_bytes` now only controls how
  much waitress will buffer internally before flushing to the kernel, whereas
  previously it used to also throttle how much data was sent to the kernel.
  This change enables a streaming `app_iter` containing small chunks to
  still be flushed efficiently.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/246>

### Bugfixes[¶](#id25 "Link to this heading")

* Upon receiving a request that does not include HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 we will
  no longer set the version to the string value "None". See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/252> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/110>
* When a client closes a socket unexpectedly there was potential for memory
  leaks in which data was written to the buffers after they were closed,
  causing them to reopen.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/239>
* Fix the queue depth warnings to only show when all threads are busy.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/243>
  and <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/247>
* Trigger the `app_iter` to close as part of shutdown. This will only be
  noticeable for users of the internal server api. In more typical operations
  the server will die before benefiting from these changes.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/245>
* Fix a bug in which a streaming `app_iter` may never cleanup data that has
  already been sent. This would cause buffers in waitress to grow without
  bounds. These buffers now properly rotate and release their data.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/242>
* Fix a bug in which non-seekable subclasses of `io.IOBase` would trigger
  an exception when passed to the `wsgi.file_wrapper` callback.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/249>

## 1.2.1 (2019-01-25)[¶](#id26 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfixes[¶](#id27 "Link to this heading")

* When given an IPv6 address in `X-Forwarded-For` or `Forwarded for=`
  waitress was placing the IP address in `REMOTE_ADDR` with brackets:
  `[2001:db8::0]`, this does not match the requirements in the CGI spec which
  `REMOTE_ADDR` was lifted from. Waitress will now place the bare IPv6
  address in `REMOTE_ADDR`: `2001:db8::0`. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/232> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/230>

## 1.2.0 (2019-01-15)[¶](#id28 "Link to this heading")

No changes since the last beta release. Enjoy Waitress!

## 1.2.0b3 (2019-01-07)[¶](#b3-2019-01-07 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfixes[¶](#id29 "Link to this heading")

* Modified `clear_untrusted_proxy_headers` to be usable without a
  `trusted_proxy`.
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/228>
* Modified `trusted_proxy_count` to error when used without a
  `trusted_proxy`.
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/228>

## 1.2.0b2 (2019-02-02)[¶](#b2-2019-02-02 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfixes[¶](#id30 "Link to this heading")

* Fixed logic to no longer warn on writes where the output is required to have
  a body but there may not be any data to be written. Solves issue posted on
  the Pylons Project mailing list with 1.2.0b1.

## 1.2.0b1 (2018-12-31)[¶](#b1-2018-12-31 "Link to this heading")

Happy New Year!

### Features[¶](#id31 "Link to this heading")

* Setting the `trusted_proxy` setting to `'*'` (wildcard) will allow all
  upstreams to be considered trusted proxies, thereby allowing services behind
  Cloudflare/ELBs to function correctly whereby there may not be a singular IP
  address that requests are received from.

  Using this setting is potentially dangerous if your server is also available
  from anywhere on the internet, and further protections should be used to lock
  down access to Waitress. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/224>
* Waitress has increased its support of the X-Forwarded-\* headers and includes
  Forwarded (RFC7239) support. This may be used to allow proxy servers to
  influence the WSGI environment. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/209>

  This also provides a new security feature when using Waitress behind a proxy
  in that it is possible to remove untrusted proxy headers thereby making sure
  that downstream WSGI applications don't accidentally use those proxy headers
  to make security decisions.

  The documentation has more information, see the following new arguments:

  + trusted\_proxy\_count
  + trusted\_proxy\_headers
  + clear\_untrusted\_proxy\_headers
  + log\_untrusted\_proxy\_headers (useful for debugging)

  Be aware that the defaults for these are currently backwards compatible with
  older versions of Waitress, this will change in a future release of waitress.
  If you expect to need this behaviour please explicitly set these variables in
  your configuration, or pin this version of waitress.

  Documentation:
  <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/reverse-proxy.html>
* Waitress can now accept a list of sockets that are already pre-bound rather
  than creating its own to allow for socket activation. Support for init
  systems/other systems that create said activated sockets is not included. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/215>
* Server header can be omitted by specifying `ident=None` or `ident=''`.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/187>

### Bugfixes[¶](#id32 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress will no longer send Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length for 1xx,
  204, or 304 responses, and will completely ignore any message body sent by
  the WSGI application, making sure to follow the HTTP standard. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/166>,
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/165>,
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/152>, and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/202>

### Compatibility[¶](#compatibility "Link to this heading")

* Waitress has now "vendored" asyncore into itself as `waitress.wasyncore`.
  This is to cope with the eventuality that asyncore will be removed from
  the Python standard library in 3.8 or so.

### Documentation[¶](#documentation "Link to this heading")

* Bring in documentation of paste.translogger from Pyramid. Reorganize and
  clean up documentation. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/205>
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/70>
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/206>

## 1.1.0 (2017-10-10)[¶](#id33 "Link to this heading")

### Features[¶](#id34 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress now has a \_\_main\_\_ and thus may be called with `python -mwaitress`

### Bugfixes[¶](#id35 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress no longer allows lowercase HTTP verbs. This change was made to fall
  in line with most HTTP servers. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/170>
* When receiving non-ascii bytes in the request URL, waitress will no longer
  abruptly close the connection, instead returning a 400 Bad Request. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/162> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/64>

## 1.0.2 (2017-02-04)[¶](#id36 "Link to this heading")

### Features[¶](#id37 "Link to this heading")

* Python 3.6 is now officially supported in Waitress

### Bugfixes[¶](#id38 "Link to this heading")

* Add a work-around for libc issue on Linux not following the documented
  standards. If getnameinfo() fails because of DNS not being available it
  should return the IP address instead of the reverse DNS entry, however
  instead getnameinfo() raises. We catch this, and ask getnameinfo()
  for the same information again, explicitly asking for IP address instead of
  reverse DNS hostname. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/149> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/153>

## 1.0.1 (2016-10-22)[¶](#id39 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfixes[¶](#id40 "Link to this heading")

* IPv6 support on Windows was broken due to missing constants in the socket
  module. This has been resolved by setting the constants on Windows if they
  are missing. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/138>
* A ValueError was raised on Windows when passing a string for the port, on
  Windows in Python 2 using service names instead of port numbers doesn't work
  with getaddrinfo. This has been resolved by attempting to convert the port
  number to an integer, if that fails a ValueError will be raised. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/139>

## 1.0.0 (2016-08-31)[¶](#id41 "Link to this heading")

### Bugfixes[¶](#id42 "Link to this heading")

* Removed AI\_ADDRCONFIG from the call to getaddrinfo, this resolves an
  issue whereby getaddrinfo wouldn't return any addresses to bind to on
  hosts where there is no internet connection but localhost is requested to be
  bound to. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/131> for more
  information.

### Deprecations[¶](#id43 "Link to this heading")

* Python 2.6 is no longer supported.

### Features[¶](#id44 "Link to this heading")

* IPv6 support
* Waitress is now able to listen on multiple sockets, including IPv4 and IPv6.
  Instead of passing in a host/port combination you now provide waitress with a
  space delineated list, and it will create as many sockets as required.

  ```
  from waitress import serve
  serve(wsgiapp, listen='0.0.0.0:8080 [::]:9090 *:6543')

  ```

### Security[¶](#id45 "Link to this heading")

* Waitress will now drop HTTP headers that contain an underscore in the key
  when received from a client. This is to stop any possible underscore/dash
  conflation that may lead to security issues. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/80> and
  <https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/jan/13/security/>

## 0.9.0 (2016-04-15)[¶](#id46 "Link to this heading")

### Deprecations[¶](#id47 "Link to this heading")

* Python 3.2 is no longer supported by Waitress.
* Python 2.6 will no longer be supported by Waitress in future releases.

### Security/Protections[¶](#security-protections "Link to this heading")

* Building on the changes made in pull request 117, add in checking for line
  feed/carriage return HTTP Response Splitting in the status line, as well as
  the key of a header. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/124> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/122>.
* Waitress will no longer accept headers or status lines with
  newline/carriage returns in them, thereby disallowing HTTP Response
  Splitting. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/117> for
  more information, as well as
  <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting>.

### Bugfixes[¶](#id48 "Link to this heading")

* FileBasedBuffer and more important ReadOnlyFileBasedBuffer no longer report
  False when tested with bool(), instead always returning True, and becoming
  more iterator like.
  See: <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/82> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/76>
* Call prune() on the output buffer at the end of a request so that it doesn't
  continue to grow without bounds. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/111> for more information.

## 0.8.10 (2015-09-02)[¶](#id49 "Link to this heading")

* Add support for Python 3.4, 3.5b2, and PyPy3.
* Use a nonglobal asyncore socket map by default, trying to prevent conflicts
  with apps and libs that use the asyncore global socket map ala
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/63>. You can get the old
  use-global-socket-map behavior back by passing `asyncore.socket_map` to the
  `create_server` function as the `map` argument.
* Waitress violated PEP 3333 with respect to reraising an exception when
  `start_response` was called with an `exc_info` argument. It would
  reraise the exception even if no data had been sent to the client. It now
  only reraises the exception if data has actually been sent to the client.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/52> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/51>
* Add a `docs` section to tox.ini that, when run, ensures docs can be built.
* If an `application` value of `None` is supplied to the `create_server`
  constructor function, a ValueError is now raised eagerly instead of an error
  occuring during runtime. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/60>
* Fix parsing of multi-line (folded) headers.
  See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/53> and
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/90>
* Switch from the low level Python thread/\_thread module to the threading
  module.
* Improved exception information should module import go awry.

## 0.8.9 (2014-05-16)[¶](#id50 "Link to this heading")

* Fix tests under Windows. NB: to run tests under Windows, you cannot run
  "setup.py test" or "setup.py nosetests". Instead you must run `python.exe
  -c "import nose; nose.main()"`. If you try to run the tests using the
  normal method under Windows, each subprocess created by the test suite will
  attempt to run the test suite again. See
  <https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/issues/407> for more information.
* Give the WSGI app\_iter generated when `wsgi.file_wrapper` is used
  (ReadOnlyFileBasedBuffer) a `close` method. Do not call `close` on an
  instance of such a class when it's used as a WSGI app\_iter, however. This is
  part of a fix which prevents a leakage of file descriptors; the other part of
  the fix was in WebOb
  (<https://github.com/Pylons/webob/commit/951a41ce57bd853947f842028bccb500bd5237da>).
* Allow trusted proxies to override `wsgi.url_scheme` via a request header,
  `X_FORWARDED_PROTO`. Allows proxies which serve mixed HTTP / HTTPS
  requests to control signal which are served as HTTPS. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/42>.

## 0.8.8 (2013-11-30)[¶](#id51 "Link to this heading")

* Fix some cases where the creation of extremely large output buffers (greater
  than 2GB, suspected to be buffers added via `wsgi.file_wrapper`) might
  cause an OverflowError on Python 2. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/47>.
* When the `url_prefix` adjustment starts with more than one slash, all
  slashes except one will be stripped from its beginning. This differs from
  older behavior where more than one leading slash would be preserved in
  `url_prefix`.
* If a client somehow manages to send an empty path, we no longer convert the
  empty path to a single slash in `PATH_INFO`. Instead, the path remains
  empty. According to RFC 2616 section "5.1.2 Request-URI", the scenario of a
  client sending an empty path is actually not possible because the request URI
  portion cannot be empty.
* If the `url_prefix` adjustment matches the request path exactly, we now
  compute `SCRIPT_NAME` and `PATH_INFO` properly. Previously, if the
  `url_prefix` was `/foo` and the path received from a client was `/foo`,
  we would set *both* `SCRIPT_NAME` and `PATH_INFO` to `/foo`. This was
  incorrect. Now in such a case we set `PATH_INFO` to the empty string and
  we set `SCRIPT_NAME` to `/foo`. Note that the change we made has no
  effect on paths that do not match the `url_prefix` exactly (such as
  `/foo/bar`); these continue to operate as they did. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/46>
* Preserve header ordering of headers with the same name as per RFC 2616. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/44>
* When waitress receives a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` request, we no longer
  send the `TRANSFER_ENCODING` nor the `HTTP_TRANSFER_ENCODING` value to
  the application in the environment. Instead, we pop this header. Since we
  cope with chunked requests by buffering the data in the server, we also know
  when a chunked request has ended, and therefore we know the content length.
  We set the content-length header in the environment, such that applications
  effectively never know the original request was a T-E: chunked request; it
  will appear to them as if the request is a non-chunked request with an
  accurate content-length.
* Cope with the fact that the `Transfer-Encoding` value is case-insensitive.
* When the `--unix-socket-perms` option was used as an argument to
  `waitress-serve`, a `TypeError` would be raised. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/50>.

## 0.8.7 (2013-08-29)[¶](#id52 "Link to this heading")

* The HTTP version of the response returned by waitress when it catches an
  exception will now match the HTTP request version.
* Fix: CONNECTION header will be HTTP\_CONNECTION and not CONNECTION\_TYPE
  (see <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/13>)

## 0.8.6 (2013-08-12)[¶](#id53 "Link to this heading")

* Do alternate type of checking for UNIX socket support, instead of checking
  for platform == windows.
* Functional tests now use multiprocessing module instead of subprocess module,
  speeding up test suite and making concurrent execution more reliable.
* Runner now appends the current working directory to `sys.path` to support
  running WSGI applications from a directory (i.e., not installed in a
  virtualenv).
* Add a `url_prefix` adjustment setting. You can use it by passing
  `script_name='/foo'` to `waitress.serve` or you can use it in a
  `PasteDeploy` ini file as `script_name = /foo`. This will cause the WSGI
  `SCRIPT_NAME` value to be the value passed minus any trailing slashes you
  add, and it will cause the `PATH_INFO` of any request which is prefixed
  with this value to be stripped of the prefix. You can use this instead of
  PasteDeploy's `prefixmiddleware` to always prefix the path.

## 0.8.5 (2013-05-27)[¶](#id54 "Link to this heading")

* Fix runner multisegment imports in some Python 2 revisions (see
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/34>).
* For compatibility, WSGIServer is now an alias of TcpWSGIServer. The
  signature of BaseWSGIServer is now compatible with WSGIServer pre-0.8.4.

## 0.8.4 (2013-05-24)[¶](#id55 "Link to this heading")

* Add a command-line runner called `waitress-serve` to allow Waitress
  to run WSGI applications without any addional machinery. This is
  essentially a thin wrapper around the `waitress.serve()` function.
* Allow parallel testing (e.g., under `detox` or `nosetests --processes`)
  using PID-dependent port / socket for functest servers.
* Fix integer overflow errors on large buffers. Thanks to Marcin Kuzminski
  for the patch. See: <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/22>
* Add support for listening on Unix domain sockets.

## 0.8.3 (2013-04-28)[¶](#id56 "Link to this heading")

### Features[¶](#id57 "Link to this heading")

* Add an `asyncore_loop_timeout` adjustment value, which controls the
  `timeout` value passed to `asyncore.loop`; defaults to 1.

### Bug Fixes[¶](#bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* The default asyncore loop timeout is now 1 second. This prevents slow
  shutdown on Windows. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/6> . This
  shouldn't matter to anyone in particular, but it can be changed via the
  `asyncore_loop_timeout` adjustment (it used to previously default to 30
  seconds).
* Don't complain if there's a response to a HEAD request that contains a
  Content-Length > 0. See <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/7>.
* Fix bug in HTTP Expect/Continue support. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/9> .

## 0.8.2 (2012-11-14)[¶](#id58 "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id59 "Link to this heading")

* <https://corte.si/posts/code/pathod/pythonservers/index.html> pointed out that
  sending a bad header resulted in an exception leading to a 500 response
  instead of the more proper 400 response without an exception.
* Fix a race condition in the test suite.
* Allow "ident" to be used as a keyword to `serve()` as per docs.
* Add py33 to tox.ini.

## 0.8.1 (2012-02-13)[¶](#id60 "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id61 "Link to this heading")

* A brown-bag bug prevented request concurrency. A slow request would block
  subsequent the responses of subsequent requests until the slow request's
  response was fully generated. This was due to a "task lock" being declared
  as a class attribute rather than as an instance attribute on HTTPChannel.
  Also took the opportunity to move another lock named "outbuf lock" to the
  channel instance rather than the class. See
  <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/1> .

## 0.8 (2012-01-31)[¶](#id62 "Link to this heading")

### Features[¶](#id63 "Link to this heading")

* Support the WSGI `wsgi.file_wrapper` protocol as per
  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#optional-platform-specific-file-handling>.
  Here's a usage example:

  ```
  import os

  here = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

  def myapp(environ, start_response):
      f = open(os.path.join(here, 'myphoto.jpg'), 'rb')
      headers = [('Content-Type', 'image/jpeg')]
      start_response(
          '200 OK',
          headers
          )
      return environ['wsgi.file_wrapper'](f, 32768)

  ```

  The signature of the file wrapper constructor is `(filelike_object,
  block_size)`. Both arguments must be passed as positional (not keyword)
  arguments. The result of creating a file wrapper should be **returned** as
  the `app_iter` from a WSGI application.

  The object passed as `filelike_object` to the wrapper must be a file-like
  object which supports *at least* the `read()` method, and the `read()`
  method must support an optional size hint argument. It *should* support
  the `seek()` and `tell()` methods. If it does not, normal iteration
  over the filelike object using the provided block\_size is used (and copying
  is done, negating any benefit of the file wrapper). It *should* support a
  `close()` method.

  The specified `block_size` argument to the file wrapper constructor will
  be used only when the `filelike_object` doesn't support `seek` and/or
  `tell` methods. Waitress needs to use normal iteration to serve the file
  in this degenerate case (as per the WSGI spec), and this block size will be
  used as the iteration chunk size. The `block_size` argument is optional;
  if it is not passed, a default value``32768`` is used.

  Waitress will set a `Content-Length` header on the behalf of an
  application when a file wrapper with a sufficiently filelike object is used
  if the application hasn't already set one.

  The machinery which handles a file wrapper currently doesn't do anything
  particularly special using fancy system calls (it doesn't use `sendfile`
  for example); using it currently just prevents the system from needing to
  copy data to a temporary buffer in order to send it to the client. No
  copying of data is done when a WSGI app returns a file wrapper that wraps a
  sufficiently filelike object. It may do something fancier in the future.

## 0.7 (2012-01-11)[¶](#id64 "Link to this heading")

### Features[¶](#id65 "Link to this heading")

* Default `send_bytes` value is now 18000 instead of 9000. The larger
  default value prevents asyncore from needing to execute select so many
  times to serve large files, speeding up file serving by about 15%-20% or
  so. This is probably only an optimization for LAN communications, and
  could slow things down across a WAN (due to higher TCP overhead), but we're
  likely to be behind a reverse proxy on a LAN anyway if in production.
* Added an (undocumented) profiling feature to the `serve()` command.

## 0.6.1 (2012-01-08)[¶](#id66 "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id67 "Link to this heading")

* Remove performance-sapping call to `pull_trigger` in the channel's
  `write_soon` method added mistakenly in 0.6.

## 0.6 (2012-01-07)[¶](#id68 "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id69 "Link to this heading")

* A logic error prevented the internal outbuf buffer of a channel from being
  flushed when the client could not accept the entire contents of the output
  buffer in a single succession of socket.send calls when the channel was in
  a "pending close" state. The socket in such a case would be closed
  prematurely, sometimes resulting in partially delivered content. This was
  discovered by a user using waitress behind an Nginx reverse proxy, which
  apparently is not always ready to receive data. The symptom was that he
  received "half" of a large CSS file (110K) while serving content via
  waitress behind the proxy.

## 0.5 (2012-01-03)[¶](#id70 "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id71 "Link to this heading")

* Fix PATH\_INFO encoding/decoding on Python 3 (as per PEP 3333, tunnel
  bytes-in-unicode-as-latin-1-after-unquoting).

## 0.4 (2012-01-02)[¶](#id72 "Link to this heading")

### Features[¶](#id73 "Link to this heading")

* Added "design" document to docs.

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id74 "Link to this heading")

* Set default `connection_limit` back to 100 for benefit of maximal
  platform compatibility.
* Normalize setting of `last_activity` during send.
* Minor resource cleanups during tests.
* Channel timeout cleanup was broken.

## 0.3 (2012-01-02)[¶](#id75 "Link to this heading")

### Features[¶](#id76 "Link to this heading")

* Dont hang a thread up trying to send data to slow clients.
* Use self.logger to log socket errors instead of self.log\_info (normalize).
* Remove pointless handle\_error method from channel.
* Queue requests instead of tasks in a channel.

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id77 "Link to this heading")

* Expect: 100-continue responses were broken.

## 0.2 (2011-12-31)[¶](#id78 "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[¶](#id79 "Link to this heading")

* Set up logging by calling logging.basicConfig() when `serve` is called
  (show tracebacks and other warnings to console by default).
* Disallow WSGI applications to set "hop-by-hop" headers (Connection,
  Transfer-Encoding, etc).
* Don't treat 304 status responses specially in HTTP/1.1 mode.
* Remove out of date `interfaces.py` file.
* Normalize logging (all output is now sent to the `waitress` logger rather
  than in degenerate cases some output being sent directly to stderr).

### Features[¶](#id80 "Link to this heading")

* Support HTTP/1.1 `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` responses.
* Slightly better docs about logging.

## 0.1 (2011-12-30)[¶](#id81 "Link to this heading")

* Initial release.

## Known Issues[¶](#known-issues "Link to this heading")

* Does not support TLS natively. See [Using Behind a Reverse Proxy](reverse-proxy.html#using-behind-a-reverse-proxy) for more information.

## Why?[¶](#why "Link to this heading")

At the time of the release of Waitress, there are already many pure-Python
WSGI servers. Why would we need another?

Waitress is meant to be useful to web framework authors who require broad
platform support. It's neither the fastest nor the fanciest WSGI server
available but using it helps eliminate the N-by-M documentation burden
(e.g. production vs. deployment, Windows vs. Unix, Python 3 vs. Python 2,
PyPy vs. CPython) and resulting user confusion imposed by spotty platform
support of the current (2012-ish) crop of WSGI servers. For example,
`gunicorn` is great, but doesn't run on Windows. `paste.httpserver` is
perfectly serviceable, but doesn't run under Python 3 and has no dedicated
tests suite that would allow someone who did a Python 3 port to know it
worked after a port was completed. `wsgiref` works fine under most any
Python, but it's a little slow and it's not recommended for production use as
it's single-threaded and has not been audited for security issues.

At the time of this writing, some existing WSGI servers already claim wide
platform support and have serviceable test suites. The CherryPy WSGI server,
for example, targets Python 2 and Python 3 and it can run on UNIX or Windows.
However, it is not distributed separately from its eponymous web framework,
and requiring a non-CherryPy web framework to depend on the CherryPy web
framework distribution simply for its server component is awkward. The test
suite of the CherryPy server also depends on the CherryPy web framework, so
even if we forked its server component into a separate distribution, we would
have still needed to backfill for all of its tests. The CherryPy team has
started work on [Cheroot](https://bitbucket.org/cherrypy/cheroot/src/default/), which
should solve this problem, however.

Waitress is a fork of the WSGI-related components which existed in
`zope.server`. `zope.server` had passable framework-independent test
coverage out of the box, and a good bit more coverage was added during the
fork. `zope.server` has existed in one form or another since about 2001,
and has seen production usage since then, so Waitress is not exactly
"another" server, it's more a repackaging of an old one that was already
known to work fairly well.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# HTTP Request Smuggling: LF vs CRLF handling in Waitress

Critical

[digitalresistor](/digitalresistor)
published
GHSA-pg36-wpm5-g57p
Dec 20, 2019

## Package

pip

waitress
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.3.1

## Patched versions

1.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Waitress implemented a "MAY" part of the RFC7230 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.5>) which states:

```
  Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is
  the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line
  terminator and ignore any preceding CR.

```

Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message.

Example:

```
Content-Length: 100[CRLF]
X-Header: x[LF]Content-Length: 0[CRLF]

```

Would get treated by Waitress as if it were:

```
Content-Length: 100
X-Header: x
Content-Length: 0

```

This could potentially get used by attackers to split the HTTP request and smuggle a second request in the body of the first.

### Patches

This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0. This brings a range of changes to harden Waitress against potential HTTP request confusions, and may change the behaviour of Waitress behind non-conformist proxies.

Waitress no longer implements the MAY part of the specification and instead requires that all lines are terminated correctly with CRLF. If any lines are found with a bare CR or LF a 400 Bad Request is sent back to the requesting entity.

The Pylons Project recommends upgrading as soon as possible, while validating that the changes in Waitress don't cause any changes in behavior.

### Workarounds

Various reverse proxies may have protections against sending potentially bad HTTP requests to the backend, and or hardening against potential issues like this. If the reverse proxy doesn't use HTTP/1.1 for connecting to the backend issues are also somewhat mitigated, as HTTP pipelining does not exist in HTTP/1.0 and Waitress will close the connection after every single request (unless the Keep Alive header is explicitly sent... so this is not a fool proof security method)

### Issues/more security issues:

* open an issue at <https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues> (if not sensitive or security related)
* email the Pylons Security mailing list: pylons-project-security@googlegroups.com (if security related)

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential.

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

Unfortunately, if a front-end server does not process header fields with an LF the same way as it processes those with a CRLF, it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server processing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This vulnerability can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling and splitting where Waitress may see two requests, while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2020-03-05 16:32:01 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1791420#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-01-15 19:38:51 UTC  ``` Waitress through version 1.3.1 implemented a "MAY" part of the RFC7230 which states: "Although the line terminator for the start-line and header fields is the sequence CRLF, a recipient MAY recognize a single LF as a line terminator and ignore any preceding CR." Unfortunately if a front-end server does not parse header fields with an LF the same way as it does those with a CRLF it can lead to the front-end and the back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways. This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.

Setting the impact to low for Red Hat Quay. It may be fixed in a future version.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1791420#c5)  Summer Long    2020-01-16 03:43:08 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/#id6>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1791420#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-03-05 11:58:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 15.0 (Stein)  Via RHSA-2020:0720 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0720](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0720)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1791420#c10)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-03-05 16:32:01 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-16785>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1791420#c11)  Summer Long    2021-01-14 05:48:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  All affected Red Hat products ship but do not use the flawed version of python-waitress. The impact for these products is therefore rated as having a security impact of Low.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13,  because the flawed code is not used and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP13 python-waitress package.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1791420#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-02-04 16:14:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Quay 3  Via RHSA-2021:0420 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0420](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0420)   ``` |  |
