    "RELATED": "This CVE relates to HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in the waitress WSGI server.",
    "DETAILS": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Waitress incorrectly implemented RFC7230 by recognizing single LF characters as line terminators in HTTP headers. This discrepancy between how Waitress and front-end servers parsed headers could lead to HTTP request smuggling.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "HTTP request smuggling/splitting",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially inject a second HTTP request into the body of the first, leading to cache poisoning, information disclosure, or other malicious activities.",
      "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with LF instead of CRLF line endings in headers.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a system where a front-end server handles HTTP headers with LF differently than the back-end waitress server. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system."

    "DETAILS": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Waitress incorrectly handled line terminators in HTTP headers, recognizing single LF characters instead of the required CRLF sequence, as well as other header parsing issues.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "HTTP request smuggling/splitting",
      "Impact of exploitation": "This could lead to a front-end and back-end server parsing the same HTTP message in two different ways, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious requests.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted HTTP requests with inconsistent line endings or invalid header formats.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a system using waitress, exploiting the discrepancy in header parsing between a front-end server and waitress."
