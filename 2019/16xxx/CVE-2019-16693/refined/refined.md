The provided content describes five SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpIPAM.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in several PHP files. Specifically, the `table` parameter in the HTTP requests is directly used in SQL queries without adequate escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the direct use of unsanitized user input in SQL queries. This is apparent in the provided curl requests which inject malicious SQL into the `table` parameter.
- Blind SQL Injection: The second and fifth vulnerability examples demonstrate a blind SQL injection using `sleep(10)`, indicating the attacker can use time-based techniques to extract data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, IP addresses). Examples 1, 3 and 4 use `updatexml` and `concat` to extract the database user, demonstrating the capability to access database information.
- Data manipulation: Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
- Denial of Service: Using sleep queries, attackers can cause delays or make the application unavailable.
- Full database takeover: Attackers can gain complete control of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: Attackers can send malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP files with crafted SQL injection payloads in the `table` parameter.
- The vulnerable files are: `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit.php`, `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit-result.php`, `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter.php`, `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter-result.php`, and `/app/admin/custom-fields/order.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpIPAM server.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required in the provided exploit attempts, thus potentially allowing unauthenticated exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit examples use curl to send crafted HTTP requests to the specified PHP files with SQL injection payloads in the `table` parameter.
- The vulnerabilities are present in "All phpipam Versions," suggesting a widespread issue impacting many users.
- The issue report includes details about the files affected and the methods used for exploitation.
- The provided HTTP request examples show specific methods of exploiting SQL injection, using `updatexml`, `concat`, and `sleep` functions in SQL.
- CSRF token usage is seen in exploit 2 and 5, implying CSRF protection is in place, but it doesn't prevent the SQL injection vulnerability.
