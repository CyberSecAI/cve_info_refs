The provided content relates to **CVE-2019-16717**. It provides details on multiple vulnerabilities, two of which are assigned the same CVE ID.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Improper handling of PNG files, allowing malicious script code injection via comments.
*   **Weaknesses:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization when displaying modified multipart content of emails.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious script code within a user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions through the web interface (e.g., sending emails, deleting data).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    1.  Craft a PNG file with embedded Javascript code in the comments section.
    2.  Create an email with the malicious PNG file as an inline image.
    3.  Modify the email's multipart information by changing the filename to "something.html" and the content-type to "image/svg".
    4.  Send the email to the victim.
    5.  Trick the victim into clicking a hyperlink that requests the modified multipart image from the specific email.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft emails, modify their multipart content, and use social engineering tactics to trick the victim.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Bypassing local sanitization when editing email signatures' source code.
*   **Weaknesses:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied HTML content in email signatures.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious script code within a user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions through the web interface.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    1. Edit a HTML email signature.
    2. Paste a double-tagged script code like `<svg><svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an account and the ability to edit email signatures.
