Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16565:

**CVE-2019-16565**

*   **Root Cause:** The Team Concert Plugin lacks permission checks on a method that implements form validation and does not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the form validation.
    *   **CSRF:** The form validation method does not require a POST request.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read access can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credential IDs.
    *   This allows the attacker to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker leverages the form validation method that lacks permission checks to connect to a malicious URL.
    *   The attacker must know valid credential IDs which can be obtained through the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-16567
    *   The CSRF vulnerability enables an attacker to perform the attack by tricking a user into submitting a crafted request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker must know valid credential IDs which can be obtained through another vulnerability (CVE-2019-16567)

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-16565 describes a vulnerability in the Team Concert Plugin that allows an attacker with Overall/Read access to capture credentials stored in Jenkins through a CSRF attack combined with a missing permission check. The attack involves connecting to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-controlled credential IDs.
