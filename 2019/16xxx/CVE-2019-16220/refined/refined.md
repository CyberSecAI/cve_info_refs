Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper URL validation within the `wp_validate_redirect()` function in WordPress. Specifically, the function didn't properly handle URLs with missing leading slashes in the path component, particularly when a host was not explicitly set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Open Redirect:** The core vulnerability is an open redirect. By crafting a URL with a missing leading slash in the path and a specific scheme, an attacker could cause WordPress to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `wp_validate_redirect()` function failed to normalize or validate the path component of the URL correctly when a host was absent. This allowed for the injection of arbitrary URL paths, leading to the open redirect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could leverage the open redirect to conduct phishing campaigns. By crafting a malicious link that redirects through a vulnerable WordPress site, they could trick users into visiting malicious websites that appear legitimate.
- **Malware Distribution:** The open redirect could also be used to distribute malware by redirecting users to sites hosting malicious software.
- **SEO Poisoning:** While not directly mentioned, open redirects can also be exploited for SEO poisoning by redirecting users to spam or low-quality sites, potentially harming the legitimate site's SEO ranking.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to a WordPress site with a specially crafted URL-path. The attacker controls the path component of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability in the `wp_validate_redirect()` function and its specific triggering condition.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests with the specifically crafted path containing a missing leading slash (and potentially other specific scheme) to the target WordPress instance.
- **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability does not require authentication. Any unauthenticated visitor to the site can trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- **Double Slash Normalization:** The vulnerability arises when WordPress attempts to "fix" malformed URLs containing double slashes (//) by normalizing them to single slashes. However, this normalization process was flawed, as when a URL path without a leading slash is encountered, WordPress will prepend the original host to the provided path, creating the possibility of an open redirect if the path includes a valid scheme and a TLD that starts with `com` (e.g., `compare`).

- **The Fix:** The fix implemented in WordPress 5.2.3 and later versions addressed the vulnerability by ensuring that a leading slash is prepended to the path component before performing the redirect. This prevents the open redirect from occurring.

- **Lack of Public Exploit:**  While the vulnerability was known, there was no publicly known, easily exploitable method for this open redirect, which made it difficult to demonstrate for bug bounties at the time, as stated by the Medium article.
