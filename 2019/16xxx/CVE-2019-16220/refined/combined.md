Debian Bug     : 939543 942459 946905

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform various Cross-Side
Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, create
open redirects, poison cache, and bypass authorization access and
input sanitation.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.4+dfsg1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform various Cross-Side
Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, create
open redirects, poison cache, and bypass authorization access and
input sanitation.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.4+dfsg1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

One of the most annoying issues I run into with my security work is when a piece of software has a known vulnerability that has been disclosed but has no specific information available publicly. Personally, this is a problem with both my work and the bug bounties I do in my spare time. In both cases, I often fight to convince developers that there is a genuine issue with their outdated software — but I can’t prove it outside of pointing to a CVE with very little information and no known exploit available.

I encounter this issue all the time with Bug Bounty programs, which have a very strict requirement that any findings reported be actively exploitable. Outdated software simply doesn’t make the cut unless you can prove that the associated CVEs can be exploited. On the surface, this makes sense. They don't want to pay someone for a theoretical or potential finding; they want to pay for real and demonstratable issues. I don’t blame them for this decision.

There are so many known vulnerabilities for which the details haven’t been specified. This means that someone found the issue, reported it to the developer of the affected software, and disclosed the existence of this vulnerability—most likely in the patch notes of the version update that fixed the issue. If you update the software, the issue is now fixed, so it's no problem…right?

As I mentioned above, organizations and development teams are much more likely to update software if they are aware of specific vulnerabilities that affect them. These vulnerabilities that are disclosed without the specifics don’t quite do this, but they are real, and we know at least one person (the original vuln discoverer) knows how to do it.

Recently, during a Bug Bounty, I (re)discovered a vulnerability with WordPress 5.2.2 that has to do with an open redirect in how it handles the creation of 301 redirection when given a malformed URL-path in a request. In some specific cases in this WordPress version, when the URL path has double slashes (//), WordPress will attempt to correct it by taking this malformed path, replacing the double slashes with single slashes, and appending that “fixed” path to the domain in a 301 redirect. Lets take a look at how this normally looks:

**Request:**

```

As you can see,

> https://website.com/testpage//login//

became

> https://website.com/testpage/login.php

So what's the problem? Well, I was at that point in the night when I was taking long shots in my testing, and I tried to simply put a Burp Collaborator link as the full URL path in this same request (yes, I have seen this result in SSRF and a reflection of the response from said SSRF in the response to my request before). As in most cases, this did not work, but I did notice something very, very weird.

**Request:**

```

```

uh-oh, the redirect was appended to the host this time. This time, I get redirected here:

https://website.comhttp/g6nmq64efmvjitj2asm6dfni69c00wol.oastify.com

At this point I don’t have a lot of control over where this redirection goes, I mean look at it — its an open redirect that still has to start with the full domain that you’re on. but then I had an idea! I went looking for all TLDs that start with com using the following website: <https://tld-list.com/>

There were a lot more than I expected, but I narrowed the search down to just the ones available for purchase for the website that I was testing. I settled on .compare and adjusted my payload. Now, my request looks a lot more usable.

**Request:**

```

Now, I can force a redirect to a website that I can own for the low, low price of $700!

This is my favorite way to do this. I came up with it because having the same basic domain with a new TLD would seem to me to be the most believable for the type of phishing necessary to make an open redirect work best. That said, you aren’t limited to doing it only this way as you can use a path like *mynewhackersite.com://* to redirect to *https://website.commynewhackersite.com,* which may be necessary if the affected website has no open TLDs that start with the same text as the one they are currently using for this application

I had a new problem though — how do I use this? There is absolutely no way this redirection is effective because you have to send the request with the path and host separate for it to work. I can’t create a link that utilizes it because there's no path once combined. I would just be sending someone a link to <https://website.compare.>

**Edit:** I found that starting the path with a backslash (\) works, which would have been awesome a few years ago when Firefox accepted those as-is, but now all modern browsers assume you’re a silly goose who forgot which slash to use and auto-correct it to being a forward slash (/).

I never found a solution to this, but while searching, I was combing through known CVEs for WordPress in hopes that this had been found before and someone else had worked out a practical way to exploit this. Eventually, I found [CVE-2019–16220](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16220), but it was hard to even tell if this is what I was doing. As I alluded to at the top, this is one of those CVEs that are known but have no details. After some searching, I found the commit in github that fixed the issue:

```
if ( ! isset( $lp['host'] ) && ! empty( $lp['path'] ) && '/' !== $lp['path'][0] ) {
   $path = '';
   if ( ! empty( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ) ) {
    $path = dirname( parse_url( 'http://placeholder' . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], PHP_URL_PATH ) . '?' );
   }
   $location = '/' . ltrim( $path . '/', '/' ) . $location;
  }
```

In short, the fix here is that if the URL path needs to be fixed, WordPress will now also check if the path starts with a slash (/). If it doesn’t start with a slash, WordPress will add one.

Yup, this is definitely the fix for the issue I found, which means I rediscovered CVE-2019–16220. I may not have been the first to find this vulnerability, but I can at least take credit for explaining it and proving that it exists publicly.

Ultimately, I may take credit for lowering the severity of this CVE because I am convinced that it is not exploitable in any feasible way.

Please correct me if you think there's a real way to utilize this exploit because then I can appeal the rejected Bug Bounty report I gave for this.

My goal here is to prove that even among disclosed vulnerabilities, a lot of information isn’t publicly available. You can’t assume that your instance of a vulnerable version of a piece of software is safe just because the big critical vulnerabilities with known exploits don't affect it—there are tons of vulnerabilities that we know can be exploited; there just isn’t a simple script that does it for you.

Please update your software even if your security team can’t prove that it's affected by the associated CVEs

# WordPress 5.2.3 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 5.2.3 is now available!

This security and maintenance release features 29 fixes and enhancements. Plus, it adds a number of security fixes—see the list below.

These bugs affect WordPress versions 5.2.2 and earlier; version 5.2.3 fixes them, so you’ll want to upgrade.

If you haven’t yet updated to 5.2, there are also updated versions of 5.1 and earlier that fix the bugs for you.

### Security Updates

* Props to [Simon Scannell of RIPS Technologies](https://blog.ripstech.com/authors/simon-scannell/) for finding and disclosing two issues. The first, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in post previews by contributors. The second was a cross-site scripting vulnerability in stored comments.
* Props to [Tim Coen](https://security-consulting.icu/blog/) for disclosing an issue where validation and sanitization of a URL could lead to an open redirect.
* Props to Anshul Jain for disclosing reflected cross-site scripting during media uploads.
* Props to [Zhouyuan Yang of Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs](https://fortiguard.com/) who disclosed a vulnerability for cross-site scripting (XSS) in shortcode previews.
* Props to Ian Dunn of the Core Security Team for finding and disclosing a case where reflected cross-site scripting could be found in the dashboard.
* Props to Soroush Dalili ([@irsdl](https://twitter.com/irsdl?lang=en)) from NCC Group for disclosing an issue with URL sanitization that can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* In addition to the above changes, we are also updating jQuery on older versions of WordPress. This change was [added in 5.2.1](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47020) and is now being brought to older versions.

You can browse the [full list of changes on Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=5.2.3&order=priority).

For more info, browse the full list of changes on Trac or check out the Version [5.2.3 documentation page](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-2-3/).

WordPress 5.2.3 is a short-cycle maintenance release. The next major release will be [version 5.3.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-3/)

You can download WordPress 5.2.3 from the button at the top of this page, or visit your **Dashboard → Updates** and click **Update Now**.

If you have sites that support automatic background updates, they’ve already started the update process.

## Thanks and props!

Debian Bug     : 924546 939543 942459 946905 959391

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform various Cross-Side
Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, create
files on the server, disclose private information, create open
redirects, poison cache, and bypass authorization access and input
sanitation.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.7.5+dfsg-2+deb9u6.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.4+dfsg1-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

its security tracker page at:
