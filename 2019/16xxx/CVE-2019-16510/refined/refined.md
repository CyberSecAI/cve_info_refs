The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16510.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `server_example_goose` binary of the `libiec61850` library. The issue arises due to a race condition during the creation and destruction of the server threads. Specifically, the main thread frees memory associated with the MMS server and IED server while the server thread is still attempting to access it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free.
- Race condition between the main thread and server thread during server object destruction and access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash.
- Potential for more severe impacts such as arbitrary code execution if exploited further.

**Attack vectors:**
- Triggering the server to start and then exit quickly, leading to concurrent freeing and accessing of the same memory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute the `server_example_goose` binary.
- No specific network position is needed because the crash happens locally during shutdown when the server is started and stopped quickly.
