SUNRPC: Respect RPC call timeouts when retrying transmission
commit 7b3fef8e4157ed424bcde039a60a730aa0dfb0eb upstream.
Fix a regression where soft and softconn requests are not timing out
as expected.

SUNRPC: Fix up RPC back channel transmission
commit 477687e1116ad16180caf8633dd830b296a5ce73 upstream.
Now that transmissions happen through a queue, we require the RPC tasks
to handle error conditions that may have been set while they were
sleeping. The back channel does not currently do this, but assumes
that any error condition happens during its own call to xprt\_transmit().
The solution is to ensure that the back channel splits out the
error handling just like the forward channel does.

SUNRPC: Prevent thundering herd when the socket is not connected
commit ed7dc973bd91da234d93aff6d033a5206a6c9885 upstream.
If the socket is not connected, then we want to initiate a reconnect
rather that trying to transmit requests. If there is a large number
of requests queued and waiting for the lock in call\_transmit(),
then it can take a while for one of the to loop back and retake
the lock in call\_connect.

s390/setup: fix boot crash for machine without EDAT-1
commit 86a86804e4f18fc3880541b3d5a07f4df0fe29cb upstream.
The fix to make WARN work in the early boot code created a problem
on older machines without EDAT-1. The setup\_lowcore\_dat\_on function
uses the pointer from lowcore\_ptr[0] to set the DAT bit in the new
PSWs. That does not work if the kernel page table is set up with
4K pages as the prefix address maps to absolute zero.
To make this work the PSWs need to be changed with via address 0 in
form of the S390\_lowcore definition.

KVM: nVMX: Check a single byte for VMCS "launched" in nested early checks
commit 1ce072cbfd8dba46f117804850398e0b3040a541 upstream.
Nested early checks does a manual comparison of a VMCS' launched status
in its asm blob to execute the correct VM-Enter instruction, i.e.
VMLAUNCH vs. VMRESUME. The launched flag is a bool, which is a typedef
of \_Bool. C99 does not define an exact size for \_Bool, stating only
that is must be large enough to hold '0' and '1'. Most, if not all,
compilers use a single byte for \_Bool, including gcc[1].
The use of 'cmpl' instead of 'cmpb' was not deliberate, but rather the
result of a copy-paste as the asm blob was directly derived from the asm
blob for vCPU-run.
This has not caused any known problems, likely due to compilers aligning
variables to 4-byte or 8-byte boundaries and KVM zeroing out struct
vcpu\_vmx during allocation. I.e. vCPU-run accesses "junk" data, it just
happens to always be zero and so doesn't affect the result.

KVM: nVMX: Ignore limit checks on VMX instructions using flat segments
commit 34333cc6c2cb021662fd32e24e618d1b86de95bf upstream.
Regarding segments with a limit==0xffffffff, the SDM officially states:
When the effective limit is FFFFFFFFH (4 GBytes), these accesses may
or may not cause the indicated exceptions. Behavior is
implementation-specific and may vary from one execution to another.
In practice, all CPUs that support VMX ignore limit checks for "flat
segments", i.e. an expand-up data or code segment with base=0 and
limit=0xffffffff. This is subtly different than wrapping the effective
address calculation based on the address size, as the flat segment
behavior also applies to accesses that would wrap the 4g boundary, e.g.
a 4-byte access starting at 0xffffffff will access linear addresses
0xffffffff, 0x0, 0x1 and 0x2.

KVM: nVMX: Apply addr size mask to effective address for VMX instructions
commit 8570f9e881e3fde98801bb3a47eef84dd934d405 upstream.
The address size of an instruction affects the effective address, not
the virtual/linear address. The final address may still be truncated,
e.g. to 32-bits outside of long mode, but that happens irrespective of
the address size, e.g. a 32-bit address size can yield a 64-bit virtual
address when using FS/GS with a non-zero base.

KVM: nVMX: Sign extend displacements of VMX instr's mem operands
commit 946c522b603f281195af1df91837a1d4d1eb3bc9 upstream.
The VMCS.EXIT\_QUALIFCATION field reports the displacements of memory
operands for various instructions, including VMX instructions, as a
naturally sized unsigned value, but masks the value by the addr size,
e.g. given a ModRM encoded as -0x28(%ebp), the -0x28 displacement is
reported as 0xffffffd8 for a 32-bit address size. Despite some weird
wording regarding sign extension, the SDM explicitly states that bits
beyond the instructions address size are undefined:
In all cases, bits of this field beyond the instructionâ€™s address
size are undefined.
Failure to sign extend the displacement results in KVM incorrectly
treating a negative displacement as a large positive displacement when
the address size of the VMX instruction is smaller than KVM's native
size, e.g. a 32-bit address size on a 64-bit KVM.
The very original decoding, added by commit 064aea774768 ("KVM: nVMX:
Decoding memory operands of VMX instructions"), sort of modeled sign
extension by truncating the final virtual/linear address for a 32-bit
address size. I.e. it messed up the effective address but made it work
by adjusting the final address.
When segmentation checks were added, the truncation logic was kept
as-is and no sign extension logic was introduced. In other words, it
kept calculating the wrong effective address while mostly generating
the correct virtual/linear address. As the effective address is what's
used in the segment limit checks, this results in KVM incorreclty
injecting #GP/#SS faults due to non-existent segment violations when
a nested VMM uses negative displacements with an address size smaller
than KVM's native address size.
Using the -0x28(%ebp) example, an EBP value of 0x1000 will result in
KVM using 0x100000fd8 as the effective address when checking for a
segment limit violation. This causes a 100% failure rate when running
a 32-bit KVM build as L1 on top of a 64-bit KVM L0.

KVM: x86/mmu: Do not cache MMIO accesses while memslots are in flux
commit ddfd1730fd829743e41213e32ccc8b4aa6dc8325 upstream.
When installing new memslots, KVM sets bit 0 of the generation number to
indicate that an update is in-progress. Until the update is complete,
there are no guarantees as to whether a vCPU will see the old or the new
memslots. Explicity prevent caching MMIO accesses so as to avoid using
an access cached from the old memslots after the new memslots have been
installed.
Note that it is unclear whether or not disabling caching during the
update window is strictly necessary as there is no definitive
documentation as to what ordering guarantees KVM provides with respect
to updating memslots. That being said, the MMIO spte code does not
allow reusing sptes created while an update is in-progress, and the
associated documentation explicitly states:
We do not want to use an MMIO sptes created with an odd generation
number, ... If KVM is unlucky and creates an MMIO spte while the
low bit is 1, the next access to the spte will always be a cache miss.
At the very least, disabling the per-vCPU MMIO cache during updates will
make its behavior consistent with the MMIO spte behavior and
documentation.

KVM: x86/mmu: Detect MMIO generation wrap in any address space
commit e1359e2beb8b0a1188abc997273acbaedc8ee791 upstream.
The check to detect a wrap of the MMIO generation explicitly looks for a
generation number of zero. Now that unique memslots generation numbers
are assigned to each address space, only address space 0 will get a
generation number of exactly zero when wrapping. E.g. when address
space 1 goes from 0x7fffe to 0x80002, the MMIO generation number will
wrap to 0x2. Adjust the MMIO generation to strip the address space
modifier prior to checking for a wrap.

KVM: VMX: Zero out \*all\* general purpose registers after VM-Exit
commit 0e0ab73c9a0243736bcd779b30b717e23ba9a56d upstream.
...except RSP, which is restored by hardware as part of VM-Exit.
Paolo theorized that restoring registers from the stack after a VM-Exit
in lieu of zeroing them could lead to speculative execution with the
guest's values, e.g. if the stack accesses miss the L1 cache[1].
Zeroing XORs are dirt cheap, so just be ultra-paranoid.
Note that the scratch register (currently RCX) used to save/restore the
guest state is also zeroed as its host-defined value is loaded via the
stack, just with a MOV instead of a POP.

KVM: VMX: Compare only a single byte for VMCS' "launched" in vCPU-run
commit 61c08aa9606d4e48a8a50639c956448a720174c3 upstream.
The vCPU-run asm blob does a manual comparison of a VMCS' launched
status to execute the correct VM-Enter instruction, i.e. VMLAUNCH vs.
VMRESUME. The launched flag is a bool, which is a typedef of \_Bool.
C99 does not define an exact size for \_Bool, stating only that is must
be large enough to hold '0' and '1'. Most, if not all, compilers use
a single byte for \_Bool, including gcc[1].
Originally, 'launched' was of type 'int' and so the asm blob used 'cmpl'
to check the launch status. When 'launched' was moved to be stored on a
per-VMCS basis, struct vcpu\_vmx's "temporary" \_\_launched flag was added
in order to avoid having to pass the current VMCS into the asm blob.
The new '\_\_launched' was defined as a 'bool' and not an 'int', but the
'cmp' instruction was not updated.
This has not caused any known problems, likely due to compilers aligning
variables to 4-byte or 8-byte boundaries and KVM zeroing out struct
vcpu\_vmx during allocation. I.e. vCPU-run accesses "junk" data, it just
happens to always be zero and so doesn't affect the result.

KVM: Call kvm\_arch\_memslots\_updated() before updating memslots
commit 152482580a1b0accb60676063a1ac57b2d12daf6 upstream.
kvm\_arch\_memslots\_updated() is at this point in time an x86-specific
hook for handling MMIO generation wraparound. x86 stashes 19 bits of
the memslots generation number in its MMIO sptes in order to avoid
full page fault walks for repeat faults on emulated MMIO addresses.
Because only 19 bits are used, wrapping the MMIO generation number is
possible, if unlikely. kvm\_arch\_memslots\_updated() alerts x86 that
the generation has changed so that it can invalidate all MMIO sptes in
case the effective MMIO generation has wrapped so as to avoid using a
stale spte, e.g. a (very) old spte that was created with generation==0.
Given that the purpose of kvm\_arch\_memslots\_updated() is to prevent
consuming stale entries, it needs to be called before the new generation
is propagated to memslots. Invalidating the MMIO sptes after updating
memslots means that there is a window where a vCPU could dereference
the new memslots generation, e.g. 0, and incorrectly reuse an old MMIO
spte that was created with (pre-wrap) generation==0.

Move upstream stream off to just after receiving the last EOF completion

csi\_stop(). For symmetry also move upstream stream on to beginning of
csi\_start().
Doing this makes csi\_s\_stream() more symmetric with prp\_s\_stream() which
will require the same change to fix a hard lockup.

media: imx: csi: Disable CSI immediately after last EOF
commit 2e0fe66e0a136252f4d89dbbccdcb26deb867eb8 upstream.
Disable the CSI immediately after receiving the last EOF before stream
off (and thus before disabling the IDMA channel). Do this by moving the
wait for EOF completion into a new function csi\_idmac\_wait\_last\_eof().
This fixes a complete system hard lockup on the SabreAuto when streaming
from the ADV7180, by repeatedly sending a stream off immediately followed
by stream on:
while true; do v4l2-ctl -d4 --stream-mmap --stream-count=3; done
Eventually this either causes the system lockup or EOF timeouts at all
subsequent stream on, until a system reset.
The lockup occurs when disabling the IDMA channel at stream off. Disabling
the CSI before disabling the IDMA channel appears to be a reliable fix for
the hard lockup.

media: vimc: Add vimc-streamer for stream control
commit adc589d2a20808fb99d46a78175cd023f2040338 upstream.
Add a linear pipeline logic for the stream control. It's created by
walking backwards on the entity graph. When the stream starts it will
simply loop through the pipeline calling the respective process\_frame
function of each entity.

media: uvcvideo: Avoid NULL pointer dereference at the end of streaming
commit 9dd0627d8d62a7ddb001a75f63942d92b5336561 upstream.
The UVC video driver converts the timestamp from hardware specific unit
to one known by the kernel at the time when the buffer is dequeued. This
is fine in general, but the streamoff operation consists of the
following steps (among other things):
1. uvc\_video\_clock\_cleanup --- the hardware clock sample array is
released and the pointer to the array is set to NULL,
2. buffers in active state are returned to the user and
3. buf\_finish callback is called on buffers that are prepared.
buf\_finish includes calling uvc\_video\_clock\_update that accesses the
hardware clock sample array.
The above is serialised by a queue specific mutex. Address the problem
by skipping the clock conversion if the hardware clock sample array is
already released.

media: sun6i: Fix CSI regmap's max\_register
commit d31b282e2c0de9c7fb113516820340251f03a625 upstream.
max\_register is currently set to 0x1000. This is beyond the mapped
address range of the hardware, so attempts to dump the regmap from
debugfs would trigger a kernel exception.
Furthermore, the useful registers only occupy a small section at the
beginning of the full range. Change the value to 0x9c, the last known
register on the V3s and H3.
On the A31, the register range is extended to support additional
capture channels. Since this is not yet supported, ignore it for now.

media: imx: prpencvf: Stop upstream before disabling IDMA channel
commit a19c22677377b87e4354f7306f46ad99bc982a9f upstream.
Upstream must be stopped immediately after receiving the last EOF and
before disabling the IDMA channel. This can be accomplished by moving
upstream stream off to just after receiving the last EOF completion in
prp\_stop(). For symmetry also move upstream stream on to end of
prp\_start().
This fixes a complete system hard lockup on the SabreAuto when streaming
from the ADV7180, by repeatedly sending a stream off immediately followed
by stream on:
while true; do v4l2-ctl -d1 --stream-mmap --stream-count=3; done
Eventually this either causes the system lockup or EOF timeouts at all
subsequent stream on, until a system reset.
The lockup occurs when disabling the IDMA channel at stream off. Stopping
the video data stream entering the IDMA channel before disabling the
channel itself appears to be a reliable fix for the hard lockup.

rcu: Do RCU GP kthread self-wakeup from softirq and interrupt
commit 1d1f898df6586c5ea9aeaf349f13089c6fa37903 upstream.
The rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake() function is invoked when it might be necessary
to wake the RCU grace-period kthread. Because self-wakeups are normally
a useless waste of CPU cycles, if rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake() is invoked from
this kthread, it naturally refuses to do the wakeup.
Unfortunately, natural though it might be, this heuristic fails when
rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake() is invoked from an interrupt or softirq handler
that interrupted the grace-period kthread just after the final check of
the wait-event condition but just before the schedule() call. In this
case, a wakeup is required, even though the call to rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake()
is within the RCU grace-period kthread's context. Failing to provide
this wakeup can result in grace periods failing to start, which in turn
results in out-of-memory conditions.
This race window is quite narrow, but it actually did happen during real
testing. It would of course need to be fixed even if it was strictly
theoretical in nature.
This patch does not Cc stable because it does not apply cleanly to
earlier kernel versions.

The send() callback should never return length as it does not in every

transmit functionality only cares about whether the transmit was

tpm/tpm\_crb: Avoid unaligned reads in crb\_recv()
commit 3d7a850fdc1a2e4d2adbc95cc0fc962974725e88 upstream.
The current approach to read first 6 bytes from the response and then tail
of the response, can cause the 2nd memcpy\_fromio() to do an unaligned read
(e.g. read 32-bit word from address aligned to a 16-bits), depending on how
memcpy\_fromio() is implemented. If this happens, the read will fail and the
memory controller will fill the read with 1's.
This was triggered by 170d13ca3a2f, which should be probably refined to
check and react to the address alignment. Before that commit, on x86
memcpy\_fromio() turned out to be memcpy(). By a luck GCC has done the right
thing (from tpm\_crb's perspective) for us so far, but we should not rely on
that. Thus, it makes sense to fix this also in tpm\_crb, not least because
the fix can be then backported to stable kernels and make them more robust
when compiled in differing environments.

x86/ftrace: Fix warning and considate ftrace\_jmp\_replace() and ftrace\_call\_replace()
commit 745cfeaac09ce359130a5451d90cb0bd4094c290 upstream.
Arnd reported the following compiler warning:
arch/x86/kernel/ftrace.c:669:23: error: 'ftrace\_jmp\_replace' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
The ftrace\_jmp\_replace() function now only has a single user and should be
simply moved by that user. But looking at the code, it shows that
ftrace\_jmp\_replace() is similar to ftrace\_call\_replace() except that instead
of using the opcode of 0xe8 it uses 0xe9. It makes more sense to consolidate
that function into one implementation that both ftrace\_jmp\_replace() and
ftrace\_call\_replace() use by passing in the op code separate.
The structure in ftrace\_code\_union is also modified to replace the "e8"
field with the more appropriate name "op".

x86/kvmclock: set offset for kvm unstable clock
commit b5179ec4187251a751832193693d6e474d3445ac upstream.
VMs may show incorrect uptime and dmesg printk offsets on hypervisors with
unstable clock. The problem is produced when VM is rebooted without exiting
from qemu.
The fix is to calculate clock offset not only for stable clock but for
unstable clock as well, and use kvm\_sched\_clock\_read() which substracts
the offset for both clocks.
This is safe, because pvclock\_clocksource\_read() does the right thing and
makes sure that clock always goes forward, so once offset is calculated
with unstable clock, we won't get new reads that are smaller than offset,
and thus won't get negative results.
Thank you Jon DeVree for helping to reproduce this issue.

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix client IMC events return huge result

50.001142480 6.97 MiB uncore\_imc/data\_writes/
The client IMC events are freerunning counters. They still use the
old event encoding format (0x1 for data\_read and 0x2 for data write).
The counter bit width is calculated by common code, which assume that
the standard encoding format is used for the freerunning counters.
Error bit width information is calculated.
The patch intends to convert the old client IMC event encoding to the
standard encoding format.
Current common code uses event->attr.config which directly copy from
user space. We should not implicitly modify it for a converted event.
The event->hw.config is used to replace the event->attr.config in
common code.
For client IMC events, the event->attr.config is used to calculate a
converted event with standard encoding format in the custom
event\_init(). The converted event is stored in event->hw.config.
For other events of freerunning counters, they already use the standard
encoding format. The same value as event->attr.config is assigned to
event->hw.config in common event\_init().

commit d6d457451eb94fa747dc202765592eb8885a7352 upstream.
Kallsyms symbols do not have a size, so the size becomes the distance to
the next symbol.
Consequently the recently added trampoline symbols end up with large
sizes because the trampolines are some distance from one another and the
main kernel map.
However, symbols that end outside their map can disrupt the symbol tree
because, after mapping, it can appear incorrectly that they overlap
other symbols.
Add logic to truncate symbol size to the end of the corresponding map.

Six isn't a power of two, so it's not a valid alignment value. The
actual alignment doesn't matter much because it's an array of packed

aligned to four bytes because it comes immediately after the
4-byte-aligned .orc\_unwind\_ip section.

In 'commit 752f66a75aba ("bcache: use REQ\_PRIO to indicate bio for
metadata")' REQ\_META is replaced by REQ\_PRIO to indicate metadata bio.
This assumption is not always correct, e.g. XFS uses REQ\_META to mark
metadata bio other than REQ\_PRIO. This is why Nix noticed that bcache
does not cache metadata for XFS after the above commit.
Thanks to Dave Chinner, he explains the difference between REQ\_META and
REQ\_PRIO from view of file system developer. Here I quote part of his
explanation from mailing list,
REQ\_META is used for metadata. REQ\_PRIO is used to communicate to
the lower layers that the submitter considers this IO to be more
important that non REQ\_PRIO IO and so dispatch should be expedited.
IOWs, if the filesystem considers metadata IO to be more important
that user data IO, then it will use REQ\_PRIO | REQ\_META rather than
just REQ\_META.
Then it seems bios with REQ\_META or REQ\_PRIO should both be cached for
performance optimation, because they are all probably low I/O latency
demand by upper layer (e.g. file system).
So in this patch, when we want to decide whether to bypass the cache,
REQ\_META and REQ\_PRIO are both checked. Then both metadata and
high priority I/O requests will be handled properly.

bcache: treat stale && dirty keys as bad keys
commit 58ac323084ebf44f8470eeb8b82660f9d0ee3689 upstream.
Stale && dirty keys can be produced in the follow way:
After writeback in write\_dirty\_finish(), dirty keys k1 will
replace by clean keys k2
==>ret = bch\_btree\_insert(dc->disk.c, &keys, NULL, &w->key);
==>btree\_insert\_fn(struct btree\_op \*b\_op, struct btree \*b)
==>static int bch\_btree\_insert\_node(struct btree \*b,
struct btree\_op \*op,
struct keylist \*insert\_keys,
atomic\_t \*journal\_ref,
Then two steps:
A) update k1 to k2 in btree node memory;
bch\_btree\_insert\_keys(b, op, insert\_keys, replace\_key)
B) Write the bset(contains k2) to cache disk by a 30s delay work
bch\_btree\_leaf\_dirty(b, journal\_ref).
But before the 30s delay work write the bset to cache device,
these things happened:
A) GC works, and reclaim the bucket k2 point to;
B) Allocator works, and invalidate the bucket k2 point to,
and increase the gen of the bucket, and place it into free\_inc
fifo;
C) Until now, the 30s delay work still does not finish work,
so in the disk, the key still is k1, it is dirty and stale
(its gen is smaller than the gen of the bucket). and then the
machine power off suddenly happens;
D) When the machine power on again, after the btree reconstruction,
the stale dirty key appear.
In bch\_extent\_bad(), when expensive\_debug\_checks is off, it would
treat the dirty key as good even it is stale keys, and it would
cause bellow probelms:
A) In read\_dirty() it would cause machine crash:
BUG\_ON(ptr\_stale(dc->disk.c, &w->key, 0));
B) It could be worse when reads hits stale dirty keys, it would
read old incorrect data.
This patch tolerate the existence of these stale && dirty keys,
and treat them as bad key in bch\_extent\_bad().

We have observed it where both:
1) LVM/devmapper is involved (bcache backing device is LVM volume) and
2) writeback cache is involved (bcache cache\_mode is writeback)
On one machine, we can reliably reproduce it with:
# echo writeback > /sys/block/bcache0/bcache/cache\_mode
(not sure whether above line is required)
# mount /dev/bcache0 /test
# for i in {0..10}; do
file="$(mktemp /test/zero.XXX)"
dd if=/dev/zero of="$file" bs=1M count=256
sync
rm $file
done
# fstrim -v /test
Observing this with tracepoints on, we see the following writes:

Note the final one has different hit/bypass flags.
This is because in should\_writeback(), we were hitting a case where
the partial stripe condition was returning true and so
should\_writeback() was returning true early.
If that hadn't been the case, it would have hit the would\_skip test, and
as would\_skip == s->iop.bypass == true, should\_writeback() would have
returned false.
Looking at the git history from 'commit 72c270612bd3 ("bcache: Write out
full stripes")', it looks like the idea was to optimise for raid5/6:
\* If a stripe is already dirty, force writes to that stripe to
writeback mode - to help build up full stripes of dirty data
To fix this issue, make sure that should\_writeback() on a discard op
never returns true.

PM / OPP: Update performance state when freq == old\_freq
commit faef080f6db5320011862f7baf1aa66d0851559f upstream.
At boot up, CPUFreq core performs a sanity check to see if the system is
running at a frequency defined in the frequency table of the CPU. If so,
we try to find a valid frequency (lowest frequency greater than the
currently programmed frequency) from the table and set it. When the call
reaches dev\_pm\_opp\_set\_rate(), it calls \_find\_freq\_ceil(opp\_table,
&old\_freq) to find the previously configured OPP and this call also
updates the old\_freq. This eventually sets the old\_freq == freq (new
target requested by cpufreq core) and we skip updating the performance
state in this case.
Fix this by also updating the performance state when the old\_freq ==
freq.

PM / wakeup: Rework wakeup source timer cancellation
commit 1fad17fb1bbcd73159c2b992668a6957ecc5af8a upstream.
If wakeup\_source\_add() is called right after wakeup\_source\_remove()
for the same wakeup source, timer\_setup() may be called for a
potentially scheduled timer which is incorrect.
To avoid that, move the wakeup source timer cancellation from
wakeup\_source\_drop() to wakeup\_source\_remove().
Moreover, make wakeup\_source\_remove() clear the timer function after
canceling the timer to let wakeup\_source\_not\_registered() treat
unregistered wakeup sources in the same way as the ones that have
never been registered.

svcrpc: fix UDP on servers with lots of threads

James Pearson found that an NFS server stopped responding to UDP

sv\_max\_mesg is about 2^20, so that is probably where the calculation
performed by
svc\_sock\_setbufsize(svsk->sk\_sock,

nfsd: fix memory corruption caused by readdir
commit b602345da6cbb135ba68cf042df8ec9a73da7981 upstream.
If the result of an NFSv3 readdir{,plus} request results in the
"offset" on one entry having to be split across 2 pages, and is sized
so that the next directory entry doesn't fit in the requested size,
then memory corruption can happen.
When encode\_entry() is called after encoding the last entry that fits,
it notices that ->offset and ->offset1 are set, and so stores the
offset value in the two pages as required. It clears ->offset1 but
\*does not\* clear ->offset.
Normally this omission doesn't matter as encode\_entry\_baggage() will
be called, and will set ->offset to a suitable value (not on a page
boundary).
But in the case where cd->buflen < elen and nfserr\_toosmall is
returned, ->offset is not reset.
This means that nfsd3proc\_readdirplus will see ->offset with a value 4
bytes before the end of a page, and ->offset1 set to NULL.
It will try to write 8bytes to ->offset.
If we are lucky, the next page will be read-only, and the system will
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at...
If we are unlucky, some innocent page will have the first 4 bytes
corrupted.
nfsd3proc\_readdir() doesn't even check for ->offset1, it just blindly
writes 8 bytes to the offset wherever it is.
Fix this by clearing ->offset after it is used, and copying the
->offset handling code from nfsd3\_proc\_readdirplus into
nfsd3\_proc\_readdir.

nfsd: fix performance-limiting session calculation
commit c54f24e338ed2a35218f117a4a1afb5f9e2b4e64 upstream.
We're unintentionally limiting the number of slots per nfsv4.1 session
to 10. Often more than 10 simultaneous RPCs are needed for the best
performance.
This calculation was meant to prevent any one client from using up more
than a third of the limit we set for total memory use across all clients
and sessions. Instead, it's limiting the client to a third of the
maximum for a single session.
Fix this.

NFS: Fix I/O request leakages
commit f57dcf4c72113c745d83f1c65f7291299f65c14f upstream.
When we fail to add the request to the I/O queue, we currently leave it
to the caller to free the failed request. However since some of the
requests that fail are actually created by nfs\_pageio\_add\_request()
itself, and are not passed back the caller, this leads to a leakage
issue, which can again cause page locks to leak.
This commit addresses the leakage by freeing the created requests on
error, using desc->pg\_completion\_ops->error\_cleanup()

cpcap-charger: generate events for userspace
commit fd10606f93a149a9f3d37574e5385b083b4a7b32 upstream.
The driver doesn't generate uevents on charger connect/disconnect.
This leads to UPower not detecting when AC is on or off... and that is
bad.

dm integrity: limit the rate of error messages
commit 225557446856448039a9e495da37b72c20071ef2 upstream.
When using dm-integrity underneath md-raid, some tests with raid
auto-correction trigger large amounts of integrity failures - and all
these failures print an error message. These messages can bring the
system to a halt if the system is using serial console.
Fix this by limiting the rate of error messages - it improves the speed
of raid recovery and avoids the hang.

dm: fix to\_sector() for 32bit
commit 0bdb50c531f7377a9da80d3ce2d61f389c84cb30 upstream.
A dm-raid array with devices larger than 4GB won't assemble on
a 32 bit host since \_check\_data\_dev\_sectors() was added in 4.16.
This is because to\_sector() treats its argument as an "unsigned long"
which is 32bits (4GB) on a 32bit host. Using "unsigned long long"
is more correct.
Kernels as early as 4.2 can have other problems due to to\_sector()
being used on the size of a device.

If io\_setup is called successful in try\_smi\_init() but try\_smi\_init()
goes out\_err before calling ipmi\_register\_smi(), so ipmi\_unregister\_smi()
will not be called while removing module. It leads to the resource that
allocated in io\_setup() can not be freed, but the name(DEVICE\_NAME) of
resource is freed while removing the module. It causes use-after-free
when cat /proc/ioports.
Fix this by calling io\_cleanup() while try\_smi\_init() goes to out\_err.
and don't call io\_cleanup() until io\_setup() returns successful to avoid
warning prints.

ipmi\_si: Fix crash when using hard-coded device
commit 41b766d661bf94a364960862cfc248a78313dbd3 upstream.
When excuting a command like:
modprobe ipmi\_si ports=0xffc0e3 type=bt
The system would get an oops.
The trouble here is that ipmi\_si\_hardcode\_find\_bmc() is called before
ipmi\_si\_platform\_init(), but initialization of the hard-coded device
creates an IPMI platform device, which won't be initialized yet.
The real trouble is that hard-coded devices aren't created with
any device, and the fixup is done later. So do it right, create the
hard-coded devices as normal platform devices.
This required adding some new resource types to the IPMI platform
code for passing information required by the hard-coded device
and adding some code to remove the hard-coded platform devices
on module removal.
To enforce the "hard-coded devices passed by the user take priority
over firmware devices" rule, some special code was added to check
and see if a hard-coded device already exists.

Revert "KVM/MMU: Flush tlb directly in the kvm\_zap\_gfn\_range()"
commit 92da008fa21034c369cdb8ca2b629fe5c196826b upstream.
This reverts commit 71883a62fcd6c70639fa12cda733378b4d997409.
The above commit contains an optimization to kvm\_zap\_gfn\_range which
uses gfn-limited TLB flushes, if enabled. If using these limited flushes,
kvm\_zap\_gfn\_range passes lock\_flush\_tlb=false to slot\_handle\_level\_range
which creates a race when the function unlocks to call cond\_resched.
See an example of this race below:
CPU 0 CPU 1 CPU 3
// zap\_direct\_gfn\_range
mmu\_lock()
// \*ptep == pte\_1
\*ptep = 0
if (lock\_flush\_tlb)
flush\_tlbs()
mmu\_unlock()
// In invalidate range
// MMU notifier
mmu\_lock()
if (pte != 0)
\*ptep = 0
flush = true
if (flush)
flush\_remote\_tlbs()
mmu\_unlock()
return
// Host MM reallocates
// page previously
// backing guest memory.
// Guest accesses
// invalid page
// through pte\_1
// in its TLB!!
Tested: Ran all kvm-unit-tests on a Intel Haswell machine with and

arm64: KVM: Fix architecturally invalid reset value for FPEXC32\_EL2
commit c88b093693ccbe41991ef2e9b1d251945e6e54ed upstream.
Due to what looks like a typo dating back to the original addition
of FPEXC32\_EL2 handling, KVM currently initialises this register to
an architecturally invalid value.
As a result, the VECITR field (RES1) in bits [10:8] is initialised
with 0, and the two reserved (RES0) bits [6:5] are initialised with
1. (In the Common VFP Subarchitecture as specified by ARMv7-A,
these two bits were IMP DEF. ARMv8-A removes them.)
This patch changes the reset value from 0x70 to 0x700, which
reflects the architectural constraints and is presumably what was
originally intended.

arm64: debug: Ensure debug handlers check triggering exception level
commit 6bd288569b50bc89fa5513031086746968f585cb upstream.
Debug exception handlers may be called for exceptions generated both by
user and kernel code. In many cases, this is checked explicitly, but
in other cases things either happen to work by happy accident or they
go slightly wrong. For example, executing 'brk #4' from userspace will
enter the kprobes code and be ignored, but the instruction will be
retried forever in userspace instead of delivering a SIGTRAP.
Fix this issue in the most stable-friendly fashion by simply adding
explicit checks of the triggering exception level to all of our debug
exception handlers.

arm64: debug: Don't propagate UNKNOWN FAR into si\_code for debug signals
commit b9a4b9d084d978f80eb9210727c81804588b42ff upstream.
FAR\_EL1 is UNKNOWN for all debug exceptions other than those caused by
taking a hardware watchpoint. Unfortunately, if a debug handler returns
a non-zero value, then we will propagate the UNKNOWN FAR value to
userspace via the si\_addr field of the SIGTRAP siginfo\_t.
Instead, let's set si\_addr to take on the PC of the faulting instruction,
which we have available in the current pt\_regs.

arm64: Fix HCR.TGE status for NMI contexts
commit 5870970b9a828d8693aa6d15742573289d7dbcd0 upstream.
When using VHE, the host needs to clear HCR\_EL2.TGE bit in order
to interact with guest TLBs, switching from EL2&0 translation regime
to EL1&0.
However, some non-maskable asynchronous event could happen while TGE is
cleared like SDEI. Because of this address translation operations
relying on EL2&0 translation regime could fail (tlb invalidation,
userspace access, ...).
Fix this by properly setting HCR\_EL2.TGE when entering NMI context and
clear it if necessary when returning to the interrupted context.

powerpc/traps: fix recoverability of machine check handling on book3s/32
commit 0bbea75c476b77fa7d7811d6be911cc7583e640f upstream.
Looks like book3s/32 doesn't set RI on machine check, so
checking RI before calling die() will always be fatal
allthought this is not an issue in most cases.

powerpc/smp: Fix NMI IPI xmon timeout
commit 88b9a3d1425a436e95c41f09986fdae2daee437a upstream.
The xmon debugger IPI handler waits in the callback function while
xmon is still active. This means they don't complete the IPI, and the
initiator always times out waiting for them.
Things manage to work after the timeout because there is some fallback
logic to keep NMI IPI state sane in case of the timeout, but this is a
bit ugly.
This patch changes NMI IPI back to half-asynchronous (i.e., wait for
everyone to call in, do not wait for IPI function to complete), but
the complexity is avoided by going one step further and allowing new
IPIs to be issued before the IPI functions to all complete.
If synchronization against that is required, it is left up to the
caller, but current callers don't require that. In fact with the
timeout handling, callers must be able to cope with this already.

powerpc/hugetlb: Don't do runtime allocation of 16G pages in LPAR configuration
commit 35f2806b481f5b9207f25e1886cba5d1c4d12cc7 upstream.
We added runtime allocation of 16G pages in commit 4ae279c2c96a
("powerpc/mm/hugetlb: Allow runtime allocation of 16G.") That was done
to enable 16G allocation on PowerNV and KVM config. In case of KVM
config, we mostly would have the entire guest RAM backed by 16G
hugetlb pages for this to work. PAPR do support partial backing of
guest RAM with hugepages via ibm,expected#pages node of memory node in
the device tree. This means rest of the guest RAM won't be backed by
16G contiguous pages in the host and hence a hash page table insertion
can fail in such case.
An example error message will look like
hash-mmu: mm: Hashing failure ! EA=0x7efc00000000 access=0x8000000000000006 current=readback
hash-mmu: trap=0x300 vsid=0x67af789 ssize=1 base psize=14 psize 14 pte=0xc000000400000386
readback[12260]: unhandled signal 7 at 00007efc00000000 nip 00000000100012d0 lr 000000001000127c code 2
This patch address that by preventing runtime allocation of 16G
hugepages in LPAR config. To allocate 16G hugetlb one need to kernel
command line hugepagesz=16G hugepages=
With radix translation mode we don't run into this issue.
This change will prevent runtime allocation of 16G hugetlb pages on
kvm with hash translation mode. However, with the current upstream it
was observed that 16G hugetlbfs backed guest doesn't boot at all.
We observe boot failure with the below message:
[131354.647546] KVM: map\_vrma at 0 failed, ret=-4
That means this patch is not resulting in an observable regression.
Once we fix the boot issue with 16G hugetlb backed memory, we need to
use ibm,expected#pages memory node attribute to indicate 16G page
reservation to the guest. This will also enable partial backing of
guest RAM with 16G pages.

powerpc/ptrace: Simplify vr\_get/set() to avoid GCC warning
commit ca6d5149d2ad0a8d2f9c28cbe379802260a0a5e0 upstream.
GCC 8 warns about the logic in vr\_get/set(), which with -Werror breaks
the build:
In function ‘user\_regset\_copyin’,
inlined from ‘vr\_set’ at arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c:628:9:
include/linux/regset.h:295:4: error: ‘memcpy’ offset [-527, -529] is
out of the bounds [0, 16] of object ‘vrsave’ with type ‘union
’ [-Werror=array-bounds]
arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c: In function ‘vr\_set’:
arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c:623:5: note: ‘vrsave’ declared here
} vrsave;
This has been identified as a regression in GCC, see GCC bug 88273.
However we can avoid the warning and also simplify the logic and make
it more robust.
Currently we pass -1 as end\_pos to user\_regset\_copyout(). This says
"copy up to the end of the regset".
The definition of the regset is:
[REGSET\_VMX] = {
.core\_note\_type = NT\_PPC\_VMX, .n = 34,
.size = sizeof(vector128), .align = sizeof(vector128),
.active = vr\_active, .get = vr\_get, .set = vr\_set
},
The end is calculated as (n \* size), ie. 34 \* sizeof(vector128).
In vr\_get/set() we pass start\_pos as 33 \* sizeof(vector128), meaning
we can copy up to sizeof(vector128) into/out-of vrsave.
The on-stack vrsave is defined as:
union {
elf\_vrreg\_t reg;
u32 word;
} vrsave;
And elf\_vrreg\_t is:
typedef \_\_vector128 elf\_vrreg\_t;
So there is no bug, but we rely on all those sizes lining up,
otherwise we would have a kernel stack exposure/overwrite on our
hands.
Rather than relying on that we can pass an explict end\_pos based on
the sizeof(vrsave). The result should be exactly the same but it's
more obviously not over-reading/writing the stack and it avoids the
compiler warning.

powerpc: Fix 32-bit KVM-PR lockup and host crash with MacOS guest
commit fe1ef6bcdb4fca33434256a802a3ed6aacf0bd2f upstream.
Commit 8792468da5e1 "powerpc: Add the ability to save FPU without
giving it up" unexpectedly removed the MSR\_FE0 and MSR\_FE1 bits from
the bitmask used to update the MSR of the previous thread in
\_\_giveup\_fpu() causing a KVM-PR MacOS guest to lockup and panic the
host kernel.
Leaving FE0/1 enabled means unrelated processes might receive FPEs
when they're not expecting them and crash. In particular if this
happens to init the host will then panic.
eg (transcribed):
qemu-system-ppc[837]: unhandled signal 8 at 12cc9ce4 nip 12cc9ce4 lr 12cc9ca4 code 0
systemd[1]: unhandled signal 8 at 202f02e0 nip 202f02e0 lr 001003d4 code 0
Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! exitcode=0x0000000b
Reinstate these bits to the MSR bitmask to enable MacOS guests to run
under 32-bit KVM-PR once again without issue.

powerpc/64s/hash: Fix assert\_slb\_presence() use of the slbfee. instruction
commit 7104dccfd052fde51eecc9972dad9c40bd3e0d11 upstream.
The slbfee. instruction must have bit 24 of RB clear, failure to do

This is not obvious from the ISA v3.0B document, which only says:
The hardware ignores the contents of RB 36:38 40:63 -- p.1032
This patch fixes the bug and also clears all other bits from PPC bit
36-63, which is good practice when dealing with reserved or ignored
bits.

powerpc/powernv: Don't reprogram SLW image on every KVM guest entry/exit
commit 19f8a5b5be2898573a5e1dc1db93e8d40117606a upstream.
Commit 24be85a23d1f ("powerpc/powernv: Clear PECE1 in LPCR via stop-api
only on Hotplug", 2017-07-21) added two calls to opal\_slw\_set\_reg()
inside pnv\_cpu\_offline(), with the aim of changing the LPCR value in
the SLW image to disable wakeups from the decrementer while a CPU is
offline. However, pnv\_cpu\_offline() gets called each time a secondary
CPU thread is woken up to participate in running a KVM guest, that is,
not just when a CPU is offlined.
Since opal\_slw\_set\_reg() is a very slow operation (with observed
execution times around 20 milliseconds), this means that an offline
secondary CPU can often be busy doing the opal\_slw\_set\_reg() call
when the primary CPU wants to grab all the secondary threads so that
it can run a KVM guest. This leads to messages like "KVM: couldn't
grab CPU n" being printed and guest execution failing.
There is no need to reprogram the SLW image on every KVM guest entry
and exit. So that we do it only when a CPU is really transitioning
between online and offline, this moves the calls to
pnv\_program\_cpu\_hotplug\_lpcr() into pnv\_smp\_cpu\_kill\_self().

powerpc/kvm: Save and restore host AMR/IAMR/UAMOR
commit c3c7470c75566a077c8dc71dcf8f1948b8ddfab4 upstream.
When the hash MMU is active the AMR, IAMR and UAMOR are used for
pkeys. The AMR is directly writable by user space, and the UAMOR masks
those writes, meaning both registers are effectively user register
state. The IAMR is used to create an execute only key.
Also we must maintain the value of at least the AMR when running in
process context, so that any memory accesses done by the kernel on
behalf of the process are correctly controlled by the AMR.
Although we are correctly switching all registers when going into a
guest, on returning to the host we just write 0 into all regs, except
on Power9 where we restore the IAMR correctly.
This could be observed by a user process if it writes the AMR, then
runs a guest and we then return immediately to it without
rescheduling. Because we have written 0 to the AMR that would have the
effect of granting read/write permission to pages that the process was
trying to protect.
In addition, when using the Radix MMU, the AMR can prevent inadvertent
kernel access to userspace data, writing 0 to the AMR disables that
protection.
So save and restore AMR, IAMR and UAMOR.

has been journaled by the committing transaction, the buffer's jbddirty
flag will not be cleared in jbd2\_journal\_forget(), so the commit code
will set the buffer dirty flag again after refile the buffer.
fsx kjournald2
jbd2\_journal\_commit\_transaction
jbd2\_journal\_revoke commit phase 1~5...
jbd2\_journal\_forget
belongs to older transaction commit phase 6
jbddirty not clear \_\_jbd2\_journal\_refile\_buffer
\_\_jbd2\_journal\_unfile\_buffer
test\_clear\_buffer\_jbddirty
mark\_buffer\_dirty
Finally, if the freed extent index block was allocated again as data
block by some other files, it may corrupt the file data after writing
cached pages later, such as during unmount time. (In general,
clean\_bdev\_aliases() related helpers should be invoked after
re-allocation to prevent the above corruption, but unfortunately we
missed it when zeroout the head of extra extent blocks in
ext4\_ext\_handle\_unwritten\_extents()).
This patch mark buffer as freed and set j\_next\_transaction to the new
transaction when it already belongs to the committing transaction in
jbd2\_journal\_forget(), so that commit code knows it should clear dirty
bits when it is done with the buffer.
This problem can be reproduced by xfstests generic/455 easily with
seeds (3246 3247 3248 3249).

There are two other drivers that bind to mrvl,mmp-uart and both of them

If this driver wins the race to bind to those devices, it should behave

serial: uartps: Fix stuck ISR if RX disabled with non-empty FIFO
commit 7abab1605139bc41442864c18f9573440f7ca105 upstream.
If RX is disabled while there are still unprocessed bytes in RX FIFO,
cdns\_uart\_handle\_rx() called from interrupt handler will get stuck in
the receive loop as read bytes will not get removed from the RX FIFO
and CDNS\_UART\_SR\_RXEMPTY bit will never get set.
Avoid the stuck handler by checking first if RX is disabled. port->lock
protects against race with RX-disabling functions.
This HW behavior was mentioned by Nathan Rossi in 43e98facc4a3 ("tty:
xuartps: Fix RX hang, and TX corruption in termios call") which fixed a
similar issue in cdns\_uart\_set\_termios().
The behavior can also be easily verified by e.g. setting
CDNS\_UART\_CR\_RX\_DIS at the beginning of cdns\_uart\_handle\_rx() - the
following loop will then get stuck.
Resetting the FIFO using RXRST would not set RXEMPTY either so simply
issuing a reset after RX-disable would not work.
I observe this frequently on a ZynqMP board during heavy RX load at 1M
baudrate when the reader process exits and thus RX gets disabled.

dmaengine: usb-dmac: Make DMAC system sleep callbacks explicit
commit d9140a0da4a230a03426d175145989667758aa6a upstream.
This commit fixes the issue that USB-DMAC hangs silently after system
resumes on R-Car Gen3 hence renesas\_usbhs will not work correctly
when using USB-DMAC for bulk transfer e.g. ethernet or serial
gadgets.
The issue can be reproduced by these steps:
1. modprobe g\_serial
2. Suspend and resume system.
3. connect a usb cable to host side
4. Transfer data from Host to Target
5. cat /dev/ttyGS0 (Target side)
6. echo "test" > /dev/ttyACM0 (Host side)
The 'cat' will not result anything. However, system still can work
normally.
Currently, USB-DMAC driver does not have system sleep callbacks hence
this driver relies on the PM core to force runtime suspend/resume to
suspend and reinitialize USB-DMAC during system resume. After
the commit 17218e0092f8 ("PM / genpd: Stop/start devices without
pm\_runtime\_force\_suspend/resume()"), PM core will not force
runtime suspend/resume anymore so this issue happens.
To solve this, make system suspend resume explicit by using
pm\_runtime\_force\_{suspend,resume}() as the system sleep callbacks.
SET\_NOIRQ\_SYSTEM\_SLEEP\_PM\_OPS() is used to make sure USB-DMAC
suspended after and initialized before renesas\_usbhs."

clk: ingenic: Fix round\_rate misbehaving with non-integer dividers
commit bc5d922c93491878c44c9216e9d227c7eeb81d7f upstream.
Take a parent rate of 180 MHz, and a requested rate of 4.285715 MHz.
This results in a theorical divider of 41.999993 which is then rounded
up to 42. The .round\_rate function would then return (180 MHz / 42) as
the clock, rounded down, so 4.285714 MHz.
Calling clk\_set\_rate on 4.285714 MHz would round the rate again, and
give a theorical divider of 42,0000028, now rounded up to 43, and the
rate returned would be (180 MHz / 43) which is 4.186046 MHz, aka. not
what we requested.
Fix this by rounding up the divisions.

There is patch "MFD: twl6040-codec: Implement PDMCLK cold temp errata"

Based on my observations, this fix is also needed when cold booting

When ext2 filesystem is created with 64k block size, ext2\_max\_size()
will return value less than 0. Also, we cannot write any file in this fs
since the sb->maxbytes is less than 0. The core of the problem is that
the size of block index tree for such large block size is more than

possibility.

possible block sizes look like:

commit edeb304f659792fb5bab90d7d6f3408b4c7301fb upstream.
Within cxl module, iteration over array 'adapter->afu' may be racy
at few points as it might be simultaneously read during an EEH and its
contents being set to NULL while driver is being unloaded or unbound
from the adapter. This might result in a NULL pointer to 'struct afu'
being de-referenced during an EEH thereby causing a kernel oops.
This patch fixes this by making sure that all access to the array
'adapter->afu' is wrapped within the context of spin-lock
'adapter->afu\_list\_lock'.

PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Extend pci\_bridge\_emul\_init() with flags
commit 33776d059630e5045ea9ccf756c74de8f9cc86de upstream.
Depending on the capabilities of the PCI controller/platform, the
PCI-to-PCI bridge emulation behavior might need to be different. For
example, on platforms that use the pci-mvebu code, we currently don't
support prefetchable memory BARs, so the corresponding fields in the
PCI-to-PCI bridge configuration space should be read-only.
To implement this, extend pci\_bridge\_emul\_init() to take a "flags"
argument, with currently one flag supported:
PCI\_BRIDGE\_EMUL\_NO\_PREFETCHABLE\_BAR
that will make the prefetchable memory base and limit registers
read-only.
The pci-mvebu and pci-aardvark drivers are updated accordingly.

PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Create per-bridge copy of register behavior
commit 59f81c35e0df840f7112cb296dde48df84a67c79 upstream.
The behavior of the different registers of the PCI-to-PCI bridge is
currently encoded in two global arrays, shared by all instances of
PCI-to-PCI bridge emulation.
However, we will need to tweak the behavior on a per-bridge basis, to
accommodate for different capabilities of the platforms where this
code is used. In preparation for this, create a per-bridge copy of the
register behavior arrays, so that they can later be tweaked on a
per-bridge basis.

PCI: pciehp: Disable Data Link Layer State Changed event on suspend
commit bbe54ea5330d828cc396d451c0e1e5c3f9764c1e upstream.
Commit 0e157e528604 ("PCI/PME: Implement runtime PM callbacks") tried to
solve an issue where the hierarchy immediately wakes up when it is
transitioned into D3cold. However, it turns out to prevent PME
propagation on some systems that do not support D3cold.
I looked more closely at what might cause the immediate wakeup. It happens
when the ACPI power resource of the root port is turned off. The AML code
associated with the \_OFF() method of the ACPI power resource starts a PCIe
L2/L3 Ready transition and waits for it to complete. Right after the L2/L3
Ready transition is started the root port receives a PME from the
downstream port.
The simplest hierarchy where this happens looks like this:
00:1d.0 PCIe Root Port
^
|
v
05:00.0 PCIe switch #1 upstream port
06:01.0 PCIe switch #1 downstream hotplug port
^
|
v
08:00.0 PCIe switch #2 upstream port
It seems that the PCIe link between the two switches, before
PME\_Turn\_Off/PME\_TO\_Ack is complete for the whole hierarchy, goes
inactive and triggers PME towards the root port bringing it back to D0.
The L2/L3 Ready sequence is described in PCIe r4.0 spec sections 5.2 and
5.3.3 but unfortunately they do not state what happens if DLLSCE is
enabled during the sequence.
Disabling Data Link Layer State Changed event (DLLSCE) seems to prevent
the issue and still allows the downstream hotplug port to notice when a
device is plugged/unplugged.

PCI: dwc: skip MSI init if MSIs have been explicitly disabled
commit 3afc8299f39a27b60e1519a28e18878ce878e7dd upstream.
Since 7c5925afbc58 (PCI: dwc: Move MSI IRQs allocation to IRQ domains
hierarchical API) the MSI init claims one of the controller IRQs as a
chained IRQ line for the MSI controller. On some designs, like the i.MX6,
this line is shared with a PCIe legacy IRQ. When the line is claimed for
the MSI domain, any device trying to use this legacy IRQs will fail to
request this IRQ line.
As MSI and legacy IRQs are already mutually exclusive on the DWC core,
as the core won't forward any legacy IRQs once any MSI has been enabled,
users wishing to use legacy IRQs already need to explictly disable MSI
support (usually via the pci=nomsi kernel commandline option). To avoid
any issues with MSI conflicting with legacy IRQs, just skip all of the
DWC MSI initalization, including the IRQ line claim, when MSI is disabled.

PCI: qcom: Don't deassert reset GPIO during probe
commit 02b485e31d98265189b91f3e69c43df2ed50610c upstream.
Acquiring the reset GPIO low means that reset is being deasserted, this
is followed almost immediately with qcom\_pcie\_host\_init() asserting it,
initializing it and then finally deasserting it again, for the link to
come up.
Some PCIe devices requires a minimum time between the initial deassert
and subsequent reset cycles. In a platform that boots with the reset
GPIO asserted this requirement is being violated by this deassert/assert
pulse.
Acquire the reset GPIO high to prevent this situation by matching the
state to the subsequent asserted state.

PCI/ASPM: Use LTR if already enabled by platform
commit 10ecc818ea7319b5d0d2b4e1aa6a77323e776f76 upstream.
RussianNeuroMancer reported that the Intel 7265 wifi on a Dell Venue 11 Pro
7140 table stopped working after wakeup from suspend and bisected the
problem to 9ab105deb60f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM L1.2 Substate if we don't
have LTR"). David Ward reported the same problem on a Dell Latitude 7350.
After af8bb9f89838 ("PCI/ACPI: Request LTR control from platform before
using it"), we don't enable LTR unless the platform has granted LTR control
to us. In addition, we don't notice if the platform had already enabled
LTR itself.
After 9ab105deb60f ("PCI/ASPM: Disable ASPM L1.2 Substate if we don't have
LTR"), we avoid using LTR if we don't think the path to the device has LTR
enabled.
The combination means that if the platform itself enables LTR but declines
to give the OS control over LTR, we unnecessarily avoided using ASPM L1.2.

ext4: fix crash during online resizing
commit f96c3ac8dfc24b4e38fc4c2eba5fea2107b929d1 upstream.
When computing maximum size of filesystem possible with given number of
group descriptor blocks, we forget to include s\_first\_data\_block into
the number of blocks. Thus for filesystems with non-zero
s\_first\_data\_block it can happen that computed maximum filesystem size
is actually lower than current filesystem size which confuses the code
and eventually leads to a BUG\_ON in ext4\_alloc\_group\_tables() hitting on
flex\_gd->count == 0. The problem can be reproduced like:
truncate -s 100g /tmp/image
mkfs.ext4 -b 1024 -E resize=262144 /tmp/image 32768
mount -t ext4 -o loop /tmp/image /mnt
resize2fs /dev/loop0 262145
resize2fs /dev/loop0 300000
Fix the problem by properly including s\_first\_data\_block into the
computed number of filesystem blocks.

gpio: pca953x: Fix dereference of irq data in shutdown
commit c378b3aa015931a46c91d6ccc2fe04d97801d060 upstream.
If a PCA953x gpio was used as an interrupt and then released,
the shutdown function was trying to extract the pca953x\_chip
pointer directly from the irq\_data, but in reality was getting
the gpio\_chip structure.
The net effect was that the subsequent writes to the data
structure corrupted data in the gpio\_chip structure, which wasn't
immediately obvious until attempting to use the GPIO again in the
future, at which point the kernel panics.
This fix correctly extracts the pca953x\_chip structure via the
gpio\_chip structure, as is correctly done in the other irq
functions.

commit 8cf7630b29701d364f8df4a50e4f1f5e752b2778 upstream.
This bug has apparently existed since the introduction of this function
in the pre-git era (4500e91754d3 in Thomas Gleixner's history.git,
"[NET]: Add proc\_dointvec\_userhz\_jiffies, use it for proper handling of
neighbour sysctls.").
As a minimal fix we can simply duplicate the corresponding check in
do\_proc\_dointvec\_conv().

mm/memory.c: do\_fault: avoid usage of stale vm\_area\_struct
commit fc8efd2ddfed3f343c11b693e87140ff358d7ff5 upstream.
LTP testcase mtest06 [1] can trigger a crash on s390x running 5.0.0-rc8.
This is a stress test, where one thread mmaps/writes/munmaps memory area
and other thread is trying to read from it:
CPU: 0 PID: 2611 Comm: mmap1 Not tainted 5.0.0-rc8+ #51
Hardware name: IBM 2964 N63 400 (z/VM 6.4.0)

page\_table\_free() is called with NULL mm parameter, but because "0" is a
valid address on s390 (see S390\_lowcore), it keeps going until it
eventually crashes in lockdep's lock\_acquire. This crash is
reproducible at least since 4.14.
Problem is that "vmf->vma" used in do\_fault() can become stale. Because
mmap\_sem may be released, other threads can come in, call munmap() and
cause "vma" be returned to kmem cache, and get zeroed/re-initialized and
re-used:
handle\_mm\_fault |
\_\_handle\_mm\_fault |
do\_fault |
vma = vmf->vma |
do\_read\_fault |
\_\_do\_fault |
vma->vm\_ops->fault(vmf); |
mmap\_sem is released |
|
| do\_munmap()
| remove\_vma\_list()
| remove\_vma()
| vm\_area\_free()
| # vma is released
| ...
| # same vma is allocated
| # from kmem cache
| do\_mmap()
| vm\_area\_alloc()
| memset(vma, 0, ...)
|
pte\_free(vma->vm\_mm, ...); |
page\_table\_free |
spin\_lock\_bh(&mm->context.lock);|
 |
Cache mm\_struct to avoid using potentially stale "vma".

mm/vmalloc: fix size check for remap\_vmalloc\_range\_partial()
commit 401592d2e095947344e10ec0623adbcd58934dd4 upstream.
When VM\_NO\_GUARD is not set area->size includes adjacent guard page,
thus for correct size checking get\_vm\_area\_size() should be used, but
not area->size.
This fixes possible kernel oops when userspace tries to mmap an area on
1 page bigger than was allocated by vmalloc\_user() call: the size check
inside remap\_vmalloc\_range\_partial() accounts non-existing guard page
also, so check successfully passes but vmalloc\_to\_page() returns NULL
(guard page does not physically exist).
The following code pattern example should trigger an oops:
static int oops\_mmap(struct file \*file, struct vm\_area\_struct \*vma)
{
void \*mem;
mem = vmalloc\_user(4096);
BUG\_ON(!mem);
/\* Do not care about mem leak \*/
return remap\_vmalloc\_range(vma, mem, 0);
}
And userspace simply mmaps size + PAGE\_SIZE:
mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT\_WRITE|PROT\_READ, MAP\_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
Possible candidates for oops which do not have any explicit size
checks:
\*\*\* drivers/media/usb/stkwebcam/stk-webcam.c:
v4l\_stk\_mmap[789] ret = remap\_vmalloc\_range(vma, sbuf->buffer, 0);
Or the following one:
\*\*\* drivers/video/fbdev/core/fbmem.c
static int
fb\_mmap(struct file \*file, struct vm\_area\_struct \* vma)
...
res = fb->fb\_mmap(info, vma);
Where fb\_mmap callback calls remap\_vmalloc\_range() directly without any
explicit checks:
\*\*\* drivers/video/fbdev/vfb.c
static int vfb\_mmap(struct fb\_info \*info,
struct vm\_area\_struct \*vma)
{
return remap\_vmalloc\_range(vma, (void \*)info->fix.smem\_start, vma->vm\_pgoff);
}

commit a46c68a318b08f819047843abf349aeee5d10ac2 upstream.
While do swap, we should make sure there has no new dirty page since we
should swap i\_data between two inode:
1.We should lock i\_mmap\_sem with write to avoid new pagecache from mmap
read/write;
2.Change filemap\_flush to filemap\_write\_and\_wait and move them to the
space protected by inode lock to avoid new pagecache from buffer read/write.

Before really do swap between inode and boot inode, something need to
check to avoid invalid or not permitted operation, like does this inode
has inline data. But the condition check should be protected by inode
lock to avoid change while swapping. Also some other condition will not
change between swapping, but there has no problem to do this under inode

cpufreq: pxa2xx: remove incorrect \_\_init annotation
commit 9505b98ccddc454008ca7efff90044e3e857c827 upstream.
pxa\_cpufreq\_init\_voltages() is marked \_\_init but usually inlined into
the non-\_\_init pxa\_cpufreq\_init() function. When building with clang,
it can stay as a standalone function in a discarded section, and produce
this warning:
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x616a00): Section mismatch in reference from the function pxa\_cpufreq\_init() to the function .init.text:pxa\_cpufreq\_init\_voltages()
The function pxa\_cpufreq\_init() references
the function \_\_init pxa\_cpufreq\_init\_voltages().
This is often because pxa\_cpufreq\_init lacks a \_\_init
annotation or the annotation of pxa\_cpufreq\_init\_voltages is wrong.

cpufreq: kryo: Release OPP tables on module removal
commit 0334906c06967142c8805fbe88acf787f65d3d26 upstream.
Commit 5ad7346b4ae2 ("cpufreq: kryo: Add module remove and exit") made
it possible to build the kryo cpufreq driver as a module, but it failed
to release all the resources, i.e. OPP tables, when the module is
unloaded.
This patch fixes it by releasing the OPP tables, by calling
dev\_pm\_opp\_put\_supported\_hw() for them, from the
qcom\_cpufreq\_kryo\_remove() routine. The array of pointers to the OPP
tables is also allocated dynamically now in qcom\_cpufreq\_kryo\_probe(),
as the pointers will be required while releasing the resources.
Compile tested only.

The batch API sets the same completion for each rpmh message that's sent
and then loops through all the messages and waits for that single
completion declared on the stack to be completed before returning from
the function and freeing the message structures. Unfortunately, some
messages may still be in process and 'stuck' in the TCS. At some later
point, the tcs\_tx\_done() interrupt will run and try to process messages
that have already been freed at the end of rpmh\_write\_batch(). This will
in turn access the 'needs\_free' member of the rpmh\_request structure and
cause KASAN to complain. Furthermore, if there's a message that's
completed in rpmh\_tx\_done() and freed immediately after the complete()
call is made we'll be racing with potentially freed memory when
accessing the 'needs\_free' member:
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
rpmh\_tx\_done()
complete(&compl)
wait\_for\_completion(&compl)
kfree(rpm\_msg)
if (rpm\_msg->needs\_free)
Let's fix this by allocating a chunk of completions for each message and
waiting for all of them to be completed before returning from the batch
API. Alternatively, we could wait for the last message in the batch, but
that may be a more complicated change because it looks like
tcs\_tx\_done() just iterates through the indices of the queue and
completes each message instead of tracking the last inserted message and
completing that first.

Btrfs: fix deadlock between clone/dedupe and rename
commit 4ea748e1d2c9f8a27332b949e8210dbbf392987e upstream.
Reflinking (clone/dedupe) and rename are operations that operate on two
inodes and therefore need to lock them in the same order to avoid ABBA
deadlocks. It happens that Btrfs' reflink implementation always locked
them in a different order from VFS's lock\_two\_nondirectories() helper,
which is used by the rename code in VFS, resulting in ABBA type deadlocks.
Btrfs' locking order:
static void btrfs\_double\_inode\_lock(struct inode \*inode1, struct inode \*inode2)
{
if (inode1 < inode2)
swap(inode1, inode2);
inode\_lock\_nested(inode1, I\_MUTEX\_PARENT);
inode\_lock\_nested(inode2, I\_MUTEX\_CHILD);
}
VFS's locking order:
void lock\_two\_nondirectories(struct inode \*inode1, struct inode \*inode2)
{
if (inode1 > inode2)
swap(inode1, inode2);
if (inode1 && !S\_ISDIR(inode1->i\_mode))
inode\_lock(inode1);
if (inode2 && !S\_ISDIR(inode2->i\_mode) && inode2 != inode1)
inode\_lock\_nested(inode2, I\_MUTEX\_NONDIR2);
}
Fix this by killing the btrfs helper function that does the double inode
locking and replace it with VFS's helper lock\_two\_nondirectories().

Btrfs: fix corruption reading shared and compressed extents after hole punching
commit 8e928218780e2f1cf2f5891c7575e8f0b284fcce upstream.
In the past we had data corruption when reading compressed extents that
are shared within the same file and they are consecutive, this got fixed
by commit 005efedf2c7d0 ("Btrfs: fix read corruption of compressed and
shared extents") and by commit 808f80b46790f ("Btrfs: update fix for read
corruption of compressed and shared extents"). However there was a case
that was missing in those fixes, which is when the shared and compressed
extents are referenced with a non-zero offset. The following shell script
creates a reproducer for this issue:
#!/bin/bash
mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdc &> /dev/null
mount -o compress /dev/sdc /mnt/sdc
# Create a file with 3 consecutive compressed extents, each has an
# uncompressed size of 128Kb and a compressed size of 4Kb.
for ((i = 1; i <= 3; i++)); do
head -c 4096 /dev/zero
for ((j = 1; j <= 31; j++)); do
head -c 4096 /dev/zero | tr '\0' "\377"
done
done > /mnt/sdc/foobar
sync
echo "Digest after file creation: $(md5sum /mnt/sdc/foobar)"
# Clone the first extent into offsets 128K and 256K.
xfs\_io -c "reflink /mnt/sdc/foobar 0 128K 128K" /mnt/sdc/foobar
xfs\_io -c "reflink /mnt/sdc/foobar 0 256K 128K" /mnt/sdc/foobar
sync
echo "Digest after cloning: $(md5sum /mnt/sdc/foobar)"
# Punch holes into the regions that are already full of zeroes.
xfs\_io -c "fpunch 0 4K" /mnt/sdc/foobar
xfs\_io -c "fpunch 128K 4K" /mnt/sdc/foobar
xfs\_io -c "fpunch 256K 4K" /mnt/sdc/foobar
sync
echo "Digest after hole punching: $(md5sum /mnt/sdc/foobar)"
echo "Dropping page cache..."
sysctl -q vm.drop\_caches=1
echo "Digest after hole punching: $(md5sum /mnt/sdc/foobar)"
umount /dev/sdc
When running the script we get the following output:
Digest after file creation: 5a0888d80d7ab1fd31c229f83a3bbcc8 /mnt/sdc/foobar
linked 131072/131072 bytes at offset 131072
128 KiB, 1 ops; 0.0033 sec (36.960 MiB/sec and 295.6830 ops/sec)
linked 131072/131072 bytes at offset 262144
128 KiB, 1 ops; 0.0015 sec (78.567 MiB/sec and 628.5355 ops/sec)

Dropping page cache...
Digest after hole punching: fba694ae8664ed0c2e9ff8937e7f1484 /mnt/sdc/foobar
This happens because after reading all the pages of the extent in the
range from 128K to 256K for example, we read the hole at offset 256K
and then when reading the page at offset 260K we don't submit the
existing bio, which is responsible for filling all the page in the
range 128K to 256K only, therefore adding the pages from range 260K
to 384K to the existing bio and submitting it after iterating over the
entire range. Once the bio completes, the uncompressed data fills only
the pages in the range 128K to 256K because there's no more data read
from disk, leaving the pages in the range 260K to 384K unfilled. It is
just a slightly different variant of what was solved by commit
005efedf2c7d0 ("Btrfs: fix read corruption of compressed and shared
extents").
Fix this by forcing a bio submit, during readpages(), whenever we find a
compressed extent map for a page that is different from the extent map
for the previous page or has a different starting offset (in case it's
the same compressed extent), instead of the extent map's original start
offset.
A test case for fstests follows soon.

commit e49be14b8d80e23bb7c53d78c21717a474ade76b upstream.
The scrub\_ctx csum\_list member must be initialized before scrub\_free\_ctx
is called. If the csum\_list is not initialized beforehand, the
list\_empty call in scrub\_free\_csums will result in a null deref if the
allocation fails in the for loop.

btrfs: ensure that a DUP or RAID1 block group has exactly two stripes
commit 349ae63f40638a28c6fce52e8447c2d14b84cc0c upstream.
We recently had a customer issue with a corrupted filesystem. When
trying to mount this image btrfs panicked with a division by zero in
calc\_stripe\_length().
The corrupt chunk had a 'num\_stripes' value of 1. calc\_stripe\_length()
takes this value and divides it by the number of copies the RAID profile
is expected to have to calculate the amount of data stripes. As a DUP
profile is expected to have 2 copies this division resulted in 1/2 = 0.
Later then the 'data\_stripes' variable is used as a divisor in the
stripe length calculation which results in a division by 0 and thus a
kernel panic.
When encountering a filesystem with a DUP block group and a
'num\_stripes' value unequal to 2, refuse mounting as the image is
corrupted and will lead to unexpected behaviour.
Code inspection showed a RAID1 block group has the same issues.

We should drop the lock on this error path. This has been found by a

The lock needs to be released, it's there to protect access to the
dev\_replace members and is not supposed to be left locked. The value of
state that's being switched would need to be artifically changed to an
invalid value so the default: branch is taken.

btrfs: scrub: fix circular locking dependency warning
commit 1cec3f27168d7835ff3d23ab371cd548440131bb upstream.
This fixes a longstanding lockdep warning triggered by
fstests/btrfs/011.
Circular locking dependency check reports warning[1], that's because the
btrfs\_scrub\_dev() calls the stack #0 below with, the fs\_info::scrub\_lock
held. The test case leading to this warning:
$ mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
$ mount /dev/sdb /btrfs
$ btrfs scrub start -B /btrfs
In fact we have fs\_info::scrub\_workers\_refcnt to track if the init and destroy
of the scrub workers are needed. So once we have incremented and decremented
the fs\_info::scrub\_workers\_refcnt value in the thread, its ok to drop the
scrub\_lock, and then actually do the btrfs\_destroy\_workqueue() part. So this
patch drops the scrub\_lock before calling btrfs\_destroy\_workqueue().

m68k: Add -ffreestanding to CFLAGS
commit 28713169d879b67be2ef2f84dcf54905de238294 upstream.
This patch fixes a build failure when using GCC 8.1:
/usr/bin/ld: block/partitions/ldm.o: in function `ldm\_parse\_tocblock':
block/partitions/ldm.c:153: undefined reference to `strcmp'
This is caused by a new optimization which effectively replaces a
strncmp() call with a strcmp() call. This affects a number of strncmp()
call sites in the kernel.
The entire class of optimizations is avoided with -fno-builtin, which
gets enabled by -ffreestanding. This may avoid possible future build
failures in case new optimizations appear in future compilers.
I haven't done any performance measurements with this patch but I did
count the function calls in a defconfig build. For example, there are now
23 more sprintf() calls and 39 fewer strcpy() calls. The effect on the
other libc functions is smaller.
If this harms performance we can tackle that regression by optimizing
the call sites, ideally using semantic patches. That way, clang and ICC

ovl: Do not lose security.capability xattr over metadata file copy-up
commit 993a0b2aec52754f0897b1dab4c453be8217cae5 upstream.
If a file has been copied up metadata only, and later data is copied up,
upper loses any security.capability xattr it has (underlying filesystem
clears it as upon file write).
From a user's point of view, this is just a file copy-up and that should
not result in losing security.capability xattr. Hence, before data copy
up, save security.capability xattr (if any) and restore it on upper after
data copy up is complete.

ovl: During copy up, first copy up data and then xattrs
commit 5f32879ea35523b9842bdbdc0065e13635caada2 upstream.
If a file with capability set (and hence security.capability xattr) is
written kernel clears security.capability xattr. For overlay, during file
copy up if xattrs are copied up first and then data is, copied up. This
means data copy up will result in clearing of security.capability xattr
file on lower has. And this can result into surprises. If a lower file has
CAP\_SETUID, then it should not be cleared over copy up (if nothing was
actually written to file).
This also creates problems with chown logic where it first copies up file
and then tries to clear setuid bit. But by that time security.capability
xattr is already gone (due to data copy up), and caller gets -ENODATA.
This has been reported by Giuseppe here.
https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/2015#issuecomment-447824842
Fix this by copying up data first and then metadta. This is a regression
which has been introduced by my commit as part of metadata only copy up
patches.
TODO: There will be some corner cases where a file is copied up metadata
only and later data copy up happens and that will clear security.capability
xattr. Something needs to be done about that too.

splice: don't merge into linked buffers
commit a0ce2f0aa6ad97c3d4927bf2ca54bcebdf062d55 upstream.
Before this patch, it was possible for two pipes to affect each other after
data had been transferred between them with tee():
============
$ cat tee\_test.c
int main(void) {
int pipe\_a[2];
if (pipe(pipe\_a)) err(1, "pipe");
int pipe\_b[2];
if (pipe(pipe\_b)) err(1, "pipe");
if (write(pipe\_a[1], "abcd", 4) != 4) err(1, "write");
if (tee(pipe\_a[0], pipe\_b[1], 2, 0) != 2) err(1, "tee");
if (write(pipe\_b[1], "xx", 2) != 2) err(1, "write");
char buf[5];
if (read(pipe\_a[0], buf, 4) != 4) err(1, "read");
buf[4] = 0;
printf("got back: '%s'\n", buf);
}
$ gcc -o tee\_test tee\_test.c
$ ./tee\_test
got back: 'abxx'
$
============
As suggested by Al Viro, fix it by creating a separate type for
non-mergeable pipe buffers, then changing the types of buffers in
splice\_pipe\_to\_pipe() and link\_pipe().

fs/devpts: always delete dcache dentry-s in dput()
commit 73052b0daee0b750b39af18460dfec683e4f5887 upstream.
d\_delete only unhashes an entry if it is reached with
dentry->d\_lockref.count != 1. Prior to commit 8ead9dd54716 ("devpts:
more pty driver interface cleanups"), d\_delete was called on a dentry
from devpts\_pty\_kill with two references held, which would trigger the
unhashing, and the subsequent dputs would release it.
Commit 8ead9dd54716 reworked devpts\_pty\_kill to stop acquiring the second
reference from d\_find\_alias, and the d\_delete call left the dentries
still on the hashed list without actually ever being dropped from dcache
before explicit cleanup. This causes the number of negative dentries for
devpts to pile up, and an `ls /dev/pts` invocation can take seconds to
return.
Provide always\_delete\_dentry() from simple\_dentry\_operations
as .d\_delete for devpts, to make the dentry be dropped from dcache.
Without this cleanup, the number of dentries in /dev/pts/ can be grown
arbitrarily as:
`python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(["ls", "/dev/pts"])'`
A systemtap probe on dcache\_readdir to count d\_subdirs shows this count
to increase with each pty spawn invocation above:
probe kernel.function("dcache\_readdir") {
subdirs = &@cast($file->f\_path->dentry, "dentry")->d\_subdirs;
p = subdirs;
p = @cast(p, "list\_head")->next;
i = 0
while (p != subdirs) {
p = @cast(p, "list\_head")->next;
i = i+1;
}
printf("number of dentries: %d\n", i);
}

scsi: sd: Optimal I/O size should be a multiple of physical block size
commit a83da8a4509d3ebfe03bb7fffce022e4d5d4764f upstream.
It was reported that some devices report an OPTIMAL TRANSFER LENGTH of
0xFFFF blocks. That looks bogus, especially for a device with a
4096-byte physical block size.
Ignore OPTIMAL TRANSFER LENGTH if it is not a multiple of the device's
reported physical block size.
To make the sanity checking conditionals more readable--and to
facilitate printing warnings--relocate the checking to a helper
function. No functional change aside from the printks.

scsi: virtio\_scsi: don't send sc payload with tmfs
commit 3722e6a52174d7c3a00e6f5efd006ca093f346c1 upstream.
The virtio scsi spec defines struct virtio\_scsi\_ctrl\_tmf as a set of
device-readable records and a single device-writable response entry:
struct virtio\_scsi\_ctrl\_tmf
{
// Device-readable part
le32 type;
le32 subtype;
u8 lun[8];
le64 id;
// Device-writable part
u8 response;
}
The above should be organised as two descriptor entries (or potentially
more if using VIRTIO\_F\_ANY\_LAYOUT), but without any extra data after "le64
id" or after "u8 response".
The Linux driver doesn't respect that, with virtscsi\_abort() and
virtscsi\_device\_reset() setting cmd->sc before calling virtscsi\_tmf(). It
results in the original scsi command payload (or writable buffers) added to
the tmf.
This fixes the problem by leaving cmd->sc zeroed out, which makes
virtscsi\_kick\_cmd() add the tmf to the control vq without any payload.

s390/setup: fix early warning messages
commit 8727638426b0aea59d7f904ad8ddf483f9234f88 upstream.
The setup\_lowcore() function creates a new prefix page for the boot CPU.
The PSW mask for the system\_call, external interrupt, i/o interrupt and
the program check handler have the DAT bit set in this new prefix page.
At the time setup\_lowcore is called the system still runs without virtual
address translation, the paging\_init() function creates the kernel page
table and loads the CR13 with the kernel ASCE.
Any code between setup\_lowcore() and the end of paging\_init() that has
a BUG or WARN statement will create a program check that can not be
handled correctly as there is no kernel page table yet.
To allow early WARN statements initially setup the lowcore with DAT off
and set the DAT bit only after paging\_init() has completed.

s390: vfio\_ap: link the vfio\_ap devices to the vfio\_ap bus subsystem
commit 36360658eb5a6cf04bb9f2704d1e4ce54037ec99 upstream.
Libudev relies on having a subsystem link for non-root devices. To
avoid libudev (and potentially other userspace tools) choking on the
matrix device let us introduce a matrix bus and with it the matrix
bus subsytem. Also make the matrix device reside within the matrix
bus.
Doing this we remove the forced link from the matrix device to the
vfio\_ap driver and the device\_type we do not need anymore.
Since the associated matrix driver is not the vfio\_ap driver any more,
we have to change the search for the devices on the vfio\_ap driver in
the function vfio\_ap\_verify\_queue\_reserved.

clocksource/drivers/arch\_timer: Workaround for Allwinner A64 timer instability
commit c950ca8c35eeb32224a63adc47e12f9e226da241 upstream.
The Allwinner A64 SoC is known[1] to have an unstable architectural
timer, which manifests itself most obviously in the time jumping forward
a multiple of 95 years[2][3]. This coincides with 2^56 cycles at a
timer frequency of 24 MHz, implying that the time went slightly backward
(and this was interpreted by the kernel as it jumping forward and
wrapping around past the epoch).
Investigation revealed instability in the low bits of CNTVCT at the
point a high bit rolls over. This leads to power-of-two cycle forward
and backward jumps. (Testing shows that forward jumps are about twice as
likely as backward jumps.) Since the counter value returns to normal
after an indeterminate read, each "jump" really consists of both a
forward and backward jump from the software perspective.
Unless the kernel is trapping CNTVCT reads, a userspace program is able
to read the register in a loop faster than it changes. A test program
running on all 4 CPU cores that reported jumps larger than 100 ms was
run for 13.6 hours and reported the following:
Count | Event
-------+---------------------------
9940 | jumped backward 699ms
268 | jumped backward 1398ms
1 | jumped backward 2097ms
16020 | jumped forward 175ms
6443 | jumped forward 699ms
2976 | jumped forward 1398ms
9 | jumped forward 356516ms
9 | jumped forward 357215ms
4 | jumped forward 714430ms
1 | jumped forward 3578440ms
This works out to a jump larger than 100 ms about every 5.5 seconds on
each CPU core.
The largest jump (almost an hour!) was the following sequence of reads:
0x0000007fffffffff → 0x00000093feffffff → 0x0000008000000000
Note that the middle bits don't necessarily all read as all zeroes or
all ones during the anomalous behavior; however the low 10 bits checked
by the function in this patch have never been observed with any other
value.
Also note that smaller jumps are much more common, with backward jumps
of 2048 (2^11) cycles observed over 400 times per second on each core.
(Of course, this is partially explained by lower bits rolling over more
frequently.) Any one of these could have caused the 95 year time skip.
Similar anomalies were observed while reading CNTPCT (after patching the
kernel to allow reads from userspace). However, the CNTPCT jumps are
much less frequent, and only small jumps were observed. The same program
as before (except now reading CNTPCT) observed after 72 hours:
Count | Event
-------+---------------------------
17 | jumped backward 699ms
52 | jumped forward 175ms
2831 | jumped forward 699ms
5 | jumped forward 1398ms
Further investigation showed that the instability in CNTPCT/CNTVCT also
affected the respective timer's TVAL register. The following values were
observed immediately after writing CNVT\_TVAL to 0x10000000:
CNTVCT | CNTV\_TVAL | CNTV\_CVAL | CNTV\_TVAL Error

The pattern of errors in CNTV\_TVAL seemed to depend on exactly which
value was written to it. For example, after writing 0x10101010:

0x000001ac3effffff | 0x1110100f | 0x000001ac4f10100f | +0x1000000

I was also twice able to reproduce the issue covered by Allwinner's
workaround[4], that writing to TVAL sometimes fails, and both CVAL and
TVAL are left with entirely bogus values. One was the following values:
CNTVCT | CNTV\_TVAL | CNTV\_CVAL
--------------------+------------+--------------------------------------
0x000000d4a2d6014c | 0x8fbd5721 | 0x000000d132935fff (615s in the past)

========================================================================
Because the CPU can read the CNTPCT/CNTVCT registers faster than they
change, performing two reads of the register and comparing the high bits
(like other workarounds) is not a workable solution. And because the
timer can jump both forward and backward, no pair of reads can
distinguish a good value from a bad one. The only way to guarantee a
good value from consecutive reads would be to read \_three\_ times, and
take the middle value only if the three values are 1) each unique and
2) increasing. This takes at minimum 3 counter cycles (125 ns), or more
if an anomaly is detected.
However, since there is a distinct pattern to the bad values, we can
optimize the common case (1022/1024 of the time) to a single read by
simply ignoring values that match the error pattern. This still takes no
more than 3 cycles in the worst case, and requires much less code. As an
additional safety check, we still limit the loop iteration to the number
of max-frequency (1.2 GHz) CPU cycles in three 24 MHz counter periods.
For the TVAL registers, the simple solution is to not use them. Instead,
read or write the CVAL and calculate the TVAL value in software.
Although the manufacturer is aware of at least part of the erratum[4],
there is no official name for it. For now, use the kernel-internal name
"UNKNOWN1".

clocksource/drivers/exynos\_mct: Clear timer interrupt when shutdown
commit d2f276c8d3c224d5b493c42b6cf006ae4e64fb1c upstream.
When shutting down the timer, ensure that after we have stopped the
timer any pending interrupts are cleared. This fixes a problem when
suspending, as interrupts are disabled before the timer is stopped,
so the timer interrupt may still be asserted, preventing the system
entering a low power state when the wfi is executed.

clocksource/drivers/exynos\_mct: Move one-shot check from tick clear to ISR
commit a5719a40aef956ba704f2aa1c7b977224d60fa96 upstream.
When a timer tick occurs and the clock is in one-shot mode, the timer
needs to be stopped to prevent it triggering subsequent interrupts.
Currently this code is in exynos4\_mct\_tick\_clear(), but as it is
only needed when an ISR occurs move it into exynos4\_mct\_tick\_isr(),
leaving exynos4\_mct\_tick\_clear() just doing what its name suggests it

mmc:fix a bug when max\_discard is 0
commit d4721339dcca7def04909a8e60da43c19a24d8bf upstream.
The original purpose of the code I fix is to replace max\_discard with
max\_trim if max\_trim is less than max\_discard. When max\_discard is 0
we should replace max\_discard with max\_trim as well, because
max\_discard equals 0 happens only when the max\_do\_calc\_max\_discard
process is overflowed, so if mmc\_can\_trim(card) is true, max\_discard
should be replaced by an available max\_trim.
However, in the original code, there are two lines of code interfere
the right process.
1) if (max\_discard && mmc\_can\_trim(card))
when max\_discard is 0, it skips the process checking if max\_discard
needs to be replaced with max\_trim.
2) if (max\_trim < max\_discard)
the condition is false when max\_discard is 0. it also skips the process
that replaces max\_discard with max\_trim, in fact, we should replace the
0-valued max\_discard with max\_trim.

mmc: renesas\_sdhi: Fix card initialization failure in high speed mode
commit d30ae056adb81e1d2b8b953efa74735a020b8e3b upstream.
This fixes card initialization failure in high speed mode.
If U-Boot uses SDR or HS200/400 mode before starting Linux and Linux
DT does not enable SDR/HS200/HS400 mode, card initialization fails in
high speed mode.
It is necessary to initialize SCC registers during card initialization
phase. HW reset function is registered only for a port with either of
SDR/HS200/HS400 properties in device tree. If SDR/HS200/HS400 properties
are not present in device tree, SCC registers will not be reset. In SoC
that support SCC registers, HW reset function should be registered
regardless of the configuration of device tree.
Reproduction procedure:
- Use U-Boot that support MMC HS200/400 mode.
- Delete HS200/HS400 properties in device tree.
(Delete mmc-hs200-1\_8v and mmc-hs400-1\_8v)
- MMC port works high speed mode and all commands fail.

commit de0a0decf2edfc5b0c782915f4120cf990a9bd13 upstream.
Now tuning reset will be done when the timing is MMC\_TIMING\_LEGACY/
MMC\_TIMING\_MMC\_HS/MMC\_TIMING\_SD\_HS. But for timing MMC\_TIMING\_MMC\_HS,
we can not do tuning reset, otherwise HS400 timing is not right.
Here is the process of init HS400, first finish tuning in HS200 mode,
then switch to HS mode and 8 bit DDR mode, finally switch to HS400
mode. If we do tuning reset in HS mode, this will cause HS400 mode
lost the tuning setting, which will cause CRC error.

xen: fix dom0 boot on huge systems
commit 01bd2ac2f55a1916d81dace12fa8d7ae1c79b5ea upstream.
Commit f7c90c2aa40048 ("x86/xen: don't write ptes directly in 32-bit
PV guests") introduced a regression for booting dom0 on huge systems
with lots of RAM (in the TB range).
Reason is that on those hosts the p2m list needs to be moved early in
the boot process and this requires temporary page tables to be created.
Said commit modified xen\_set\_pte\_init() to use a hypercall for writing
a PTE, but this requires the page table being in the direct mapped
area, which is not the case for the temporary page tables used in
xen\_relocate\_p2m().
As the page tables are completely written before being linked to the
actual address space instead of set\_pte() a plain write to memory can
be used in xen\_relocate\_p2m().

Commit d716ff71dd12 ("tracing: Remove taking of trace\_types\_lock in
pipe files") use the current tracer instead of the copy in
tracing\_open\_pipe(), but it forget to remove the freeing sentence in
the error path.
There's an error path that can call kfree(iter->trace) after the iter->trace
was assigned to tr->current\_trace, which would be bad to free.

tracing: Use strncpy instead of memcpy for string keys in hist triggers
commit 9f0bbf3115ca9f91f43b7c74e9ac7d79f47fc6c2 upstream.
Because there may be random garbage beyond a string's null terminator,
it's not correct to copy the the complete character array for use as a
hist trigger key. This results in multiple histogram entries for the
'same' string key.
So, in the case of a string key, use strncpy instead of memcpy to
avoid copying in the extra bytes.
Before, using the gdbus entries in the following hist trigger as an
example:
# echo 'hist:key=comm' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched\_waking/trigger
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched\_waking/hist

smb3: make default i/o size for smb3 mounts larger
commit e8506d25f740fd058791cc12a6dfa9386ada6b96 upstream.
We negotiate rsize mounts (and it can be overridden by user) to
typically 4MB, so using larger default I/O sizes from userspace
(changing to 1MB default i/o size returned by stat) the
performance is much better (and not just for long latency
network connections) in most use cases for SMB3 than the default I/O
size (which ends up being 128K for cp and can be even smaller for cp).
This can be 4x slower or worse depending on network latency.
By changing inode->blocksize from 32K (which was perhaps ok
for very old SMB1/CIFS) to a larger value, 1MB (but still less than
max size negotiated with the server which is 4MB, in order to minimize
risk) it significantly increases performance for the
noncached case, and slightly increases it for the cached case.
This can be changed by the user on mount (specifying bsize=
values from 16K to 16MB) to tune better for performance
for applications that depend on blocksize.

CIFS: Fix read after write for files with read caching
commit 6dfbd84684700cb58b34e8602c01c12f3d2595c8 upstream.
When we have a READ lease for a file and have just issued a write
operation to the server we need to purge the cache and set oplock/lease
level to NONE to avoid reading stale data. Currently we do that
only if a write operation succedeed thus not covering cases when
a request was sent to the server but a negative error code was
returned later for some other reasons (e.g. -EIOCBQUEUED or -EINTR).
Fix this by turning off caching regardless of the error code being
returned.
The patches fixes generic tests 075 and 112 from the xfs-tests.

CIFS: Do not skip SMB2 message IDs on send failures
commit c781af7e0c1fed9f1d0e0ec31b86f5b21a8dca17 upstream.
When we hit failures during constructing MIDs or sending PDUs
through the network, we end up not using message IDs assigned
to the packet. The next SMB packet will skip those message IDs
and continue with the next one. This behavior may lead to a server
not granting us credits until we use the skipped IDs. Fix this by
reverting the current ID to the original value if any errors occur
before we push the packet through the network stack.
This patch fixes the generic/310 test from the xfs-tests.

CIFS: Do not reset lease state to NONE on lease break
commit 7b9b9edb49ad377b1e06abf14354c227e9ac4b06 upstream.
Currently on lease break the client sets a caching level twice:
when oplock is detected and when oplock is processed. While the
1st attempt sets the level to the value provided by the server,
the 2nd one resets the level to None unconditionally.
This happens because the oplock/lease processing code was changed
to avoid races between page cache flushes and oplock breaks.
The commit c11f1df5003d534 ("cifs: Wait for writebacks to complete
before attempting write.") fixed the races for oplocks but didn't
apply the same changes for leases resulting in overwriting the
server granted value to None. Fix this by properly processing
lease breaks.

The NEON MAC calculation routine fails to handle the case correctly
where there is some data in the buffer, and the input fills it up
exactly. In this case, we enter the loop at the end with w8 == 0,
while a negative value is assumed, and so the loop carries on until

crypto: testmgr - skip crc32c context test for ahash algorithms
commit eb5e6730db98fcc4b51148b4a819fa4bf864ae54 upstream.
Instantiating "cryptd(crc32c)" causes a crypto self-test failure because
the crypto\_alloc\_shash() in alg\_test\_crc32c() fails. This is because
cryptd(crc32c) is an ahash algorithm, not a shash algorithm; so it can
only be accessed through the ahash API, unlike shash algorithms which
can be accessed through both the ahash and shash APIs.
As the test is testing the shash descriptor format which is only
applicable to shash algorithms, skip it for ahash algorithms.
(Note that it's still important to fix crypto self-test failures even
for weird algorithm instantiations like cryptd(crc32c) that no one
would really use; in fips\_enabled mode unprivileged users can use them
to panic the kernel, and also they prevent treating a crypto self-test
failure as a bug when fuzzing the kernel.)

crypto: skcipher - set CRYPTO\_TFM\_NEED\_KEY if ->setkey() fails
commit b1f6b4bf416b49f00f3abc49c639371cdecaaad1 upstream.
Some algorithms have a ->setkey() method that is not atomic, in the
sense that setting a key can fail after changes were already made to the
tfm context. In this case, if a key was already set the tfm can end up
in a state that corresponds to neither the old key nor the new key.
For example, in lrw.c, if gf128mul\_init\_64k\_bbe() fails due to lack of
memory, then priv::table will be left NULL. After that, encryption with
that tfm will cause a NULL pointer dereference.
It's not feasible to make all ->setkey() methods atomic, especially ones
that have to key multiple sub-tfms. Therefore, make the crypto API set
CRYPTO\_TFM\_NEED\_KEY if ->setkey() fails and the algorithm requires a
key, to prevent the tfm from being used until a new key is set.
[Cc stable mainly because when introducing the NEED\_KEY flag I changed
AF\_ALG to rely on it; and unlike in-kernel crypto API users, AF\_ALG
previously didn't have this problem. So these "incompletely keyed"
states became theoretically accessible via AF\_ALG -- though, the
opportunities for causing real mischief seem pretty limited.]

The SIMD routine ported from x86 used to have a special code path

Instead, the current glue code aligns the input pointer to 16 bytes,
which is not really necessary on this architecture (although it
could be beneficial to performance to expose aligned data to the
the NEON routine), but this could result in inputs of less than
16 bytes to be passed in. This not only fails the new extended
tests that Eric has implemented, it also results in the code
reading past the end of the input, which could potentially result
in crashes when dealing with less than 16 bytes of input at the
end of a page which is followed by an unmapped page.
So update the glue code to only invoke the NEON routine if the
input is at least 16 bytes.

For example, in gcm.c, if the kzalloc() fails due to lack of memory,
then the CTR part of GCM will have the new key but GHASH will not.
It's not feasible to make all ->setkey() methods atomic, especially ones
that have to key multiple sub-tfms. Therefore, make the crypto API set
CRYPTO\_TFM\_NEED\_KEY if ->setkey() fails, to prevent the tfm from being
used until a new key is set.
[Cc stable mainly because when introducing the NEED\_KEY flag I changed
AF\_ALG to rely on it; and unlike in-kernel crypto API users, AF\_ALG
previously didn't have this problem. So these "incompletely keyed"
states became theoretically accessible via AF\_ALG -- though, the
opportunities for causing real mischief seem pretty limited.]

fix cgroup\_do\_mount() handling of failure exits
commit 399504e21a10be16dd1408ba0147367d9d82a10c upstream.
same story as with last May fixes in sysfs (7b745a4e4051
"unfuck sysfs\_mount()"); new\_sb is left uninitialized
in case of early errors in kernfs\_mount\_ns() and papering
over it by treating any error from kernfs\_mount\_ns() as
equivalent to !new\_ns ends up conflating the cases when
objects had never been transferred to a superblock with
ones when that has happened and resulting new superblock
had been dropped. Easily fixed (same way as in sysfs
case). Additionally, there's a superblock leak on
kernfs\_node\_dentry() failure \*and\* a dentry leak inside
kernfs\_node\_dentry() itself - the latter on probably
impossible errors, but the former not impossible to trigger
(as the matter of fact, injecting allocation failures
at that point \*does\* trigger it).

libnvdimm: Fix altmap reservation size calculation
commit 07464e88365e9236febaca9ed1a2e2006d8bc952 upstream.
Libnvdimm reserves the first 8K of pfn and devicedax namespaces to
store a superblock describing the namespace. This 8K reservation
is contained within the altmap area which the kernel uses for the
vmemmap backing for the pages within the namespace. The altmap
allows for some pages at the start of the altmap area to be reserved
and that mechanism is used to protect the superblock from being
re-used as vmemmap backing.
The number of PFNs to reserve is calculated using:
PHYS\_PFN(SZ\_8K)
Which is implemented as:
#define PHYS\_PFN(x) ((unsigned long)((x) >> PAGE\_SHIFT))
So on systems where PAGE\_SIZE is greater than 8K the reservation
size is truncated to zero and the superblock area is re-used as
vmemmap backing. As a result all the namespace information stored
in the superblock (i.e. if it's a PFN or DAX namespace) is lost
and the namespace needs to be re-created to get access to the
contents.
This patch fixes this by using PFN\_UP() rather than PHYS\_PFN() to ensure
that at least one page is reserved. On systems with a 4K pages size this
patch should have no effect.

libnvdimm/label: Clear 'updating' flag after label-set update
commit 966d23a006ca7b44ac8cf4d0c96b19785e0c3da0 upstream.
The UEFI 2.7 specification sets expectations that the 'updating' flag is
eventually cleared. To date, the libnvdimm core has never adhered to
that protocol. The policy of the core matches the policy of other
multi-device info-block formats like MD-Software-RAID that expect
administrator intervention on inconsistent info-blocks, not automatic
invalidation.
However, some pre-boot environments may unfortunately attempt to "clean
up" the labels and invalidate a set when it fails to find at least one
"non-updating" label in the set. Clear the updating flag after set
updates to minimize the window of vulnerability to aggressive pre-boot
environments.
Ideally implementations would not write to the label area outside of
creating namespaces.
Note that this only minimizes the window, it does not close it as the
system can still crash while clearing the flag and the set can be
subsequently deleted / invalidated by the pre-boot environment.

nfit: Fix nfit\_intel\_shutdown\_status() command submission
commit f596c8844fe1d0022007ae6c7a377361fb653eff upstream.
The implementation is broken in all the ways the unit test did not touch:
1/ The local definition of in\_buf and in\_obj violated C99 initializer
expectations for zeroing. By only initializing 2 out of the three
struct members the compiler was free to zero-initialize the remaining
entry even though the aliased location in the union was initialized.
2/ The implementation made assumptions about the state of the 'smart'
payload after command execution that are satisfied by
acpi\_nfit\_ctl(), but not acpi\_evaluate\_dsm().
3/ populate\_shutdown\_status() is skipped on Intel NVDIMMs due to the early
return for skipping the common \_LS{I,R,W} enabling.
4/ The input length should be zero.
This breakage was missed due to the unit test implementation only
testing the case where nfit\_intel\_shutdown\_status() returns a valid
payload.
Much of this complexity would be saved if acpi\_nfit\_ctl() could be used, but
that currently requires a 'struct nvdimm \*' argument and one is not created
until later in the init process. The health result is needed before the device
is created because the payload gates whether the nmemX/nfit/dirty\_shutdown
property is visible in sysfs.

Hash algorithms with an alignmask set, e.g. "xcbc(aes-aesni)" and
"michael\_mic", fail the improved hash tests because they sometimes
produce the wrong digest. The bug is that in the case where a
scatterlist element crosses pages, not all the data is actually hashed
because the scatterlist walk terminates too early. This happens because
the 'nbytes' variable in crypto\_hash\_walk\_done() is assigned the number
of bytes remaining in the page, then later interpreted as the number of
bytes remaining in the scatterlist element. Fix it.

crypto: ofb - fix handling partial blocks and make thread-safe
commit b3e3e2db7de4a1ffe8845876c3520b866cd48de1 upstream.
Fix multiple bugs in the OFB implementation:
1. It stored the per-request state 'cnt' in the tfm context, which can be
used by multiple threads concurrently (e.g. via AF\_ALG).
2. It didn't support messages not a multiple of the block cipher size,
despite being a stream cipher.
3. It didn't set cra\_blocksize to 1 to indicate it is a stream cipher.
To fix these, set the 'chunksize' property to the cipher block size to
guarantee that when walking through the scatterlist, a partial block can
only occur at the end. Then change the implementation to XOR a block at
a time at first, then XOR the partial block at the end if needed. This
is the same way CTR and CFB are implemented. As a bonus, this also
improves performance in most cases over the current approach.

crypto: cfb - remove bogus memcpy() with src == dest
commit 6c2e322b3621dc8be72e5c86d4fdb587434ba625 upstream.
The memcpy() in crypto\_cfb\_decrypt\_inplace() uses walk->iv as both the
source and destination, which has undefined behavior. It is unneeded
because walk->iv is already used to hold the previous ciphertext block;
thus, walk->iv is already updated to its final value. So, remove it.
Also, note that in-place decryption is the only case where the previous
ciphertext block is not directly available. Therefore, as a related
cleanup I also updated crypto\_cfb\_encrypt\_segment() to directly use the
previous ciphertext block rather than save it into walk->iv. This makes
it consistent with in-place encryption and out-of-place decryption; now
only in-place decryption is different, because it has to be.

commit 394a9e044702e6a8958a5e89d2a291605a587a2a upstream.
Like some other block cipher mode implementations, the CFB
implementation assumes that while walking through the scatterlist, a
partial block does not occur until the end. But the walk is incorrectly
being done with a blocksize of 1, as 'cra\_blocksize' is set to 1 (since
CFB is a stream cipher) but no 'chunksize' is set. This bug causes
incorrect encryption/decryption for some scatterlist layouts.
Fix it by setting the 'chunksize'. Also extend the CFB test vectors to
cover this bug as well as cases where the message length is not a
multiple of the block size.

The cause is that the struct ahash\_request \*req is created as a
stack-local variable up in the stack (presumably somewhere in the IMA
implementation), then passed down into the CAAM driver, which tries to
dma\_single\_map the req->result (indirectly via map\_seq\_out\_ptr\_result)
in order to make that buffer available for the CAAM to store the result
of the following hash operation.
The calling code doesn't know how req will be used by the CAAM driver,
and there could be other such occurrences where stack memory is passed
down to the CAAM driver. Therefore we should rather fix this issue in
the CAAM driver where the requirements are known."
Fix this problem by:
-instructing the crypto engine to write the final hash in state->caam\_ctx
-subsequently memcpy-ing the final hash into req->result

stm class: Fix an endless loop in channel allocation
commit a1d75dad3a2c689e70a1c4e0214cca9de741d0aa upstream.
There is a bug in the channel allocation logic that leads to an endless
loop when looking for a contiguous range of channels in a range with a
mixture of free and occupied channels. For example, opening three
consequtive channels, closing the first two and requesting 4 channels in
a row will trigger this soft lockup. The bug is that the search loop
forgets to skip over the range once it detects that one channel in that
range is occupied.
Restore the original intent to the logic by fixing the omission.

mei: bus: move hw module get/put to probe/release
commit b5958faa34e2f99f3475ad89c52d98dfea079d33 upstream.
Fix unbalanced module reference counting during internal reset, which
prevents the drivers unloading.
Tracking mei\_me/txe modules on mei client bus via
mei\_cldev\_enable/disable is error prone due to possible internal
reset flow, where clients are disconnected underneath.
Moving reference counting to probe and release of mei bus client
driver solves this issue in simplest way, as each client provides only
a single connection to a client bus driver.

Hmm, I'm not familiar with the read/write seqcount code for 32 bit but I
don't understand how locking here helps besides slowing things down (so
if the value is constantly updated, the read thread might have a chance
to be scheduled between two updates which was harder to do before ; and
thus "solving" your soft lockup)

Instead, a better fix would be to update v9fs_stat2inode to first read
the inode size, and only call i_size_write if it changed - I'd bet this
also fixes the problem and looks better than locking to me.
(Can also probably reuse stat->length instead of the following
i_size_read for i_blocks...)

On the other hand it might make sense to also lock the inode for
stat2inode because we're dealing with partially updated inodes at time,
but if we do this I'd rather put the locking in v9fs_stat2inode and not
outside of it to catch all the places where it's used; but the readers
don't lock so I'm not sure it makes much sense.

There's also a window during which the inode's nlink is dropped down to
1 then set again appropriately if the extension is present; that's
rather ugly and we probably should only reset it to 1 if the attribute
wasn't set before... That can be another patch and/or I'll do it
eventually if you don't.

I hope what I said makes sense.

Thanks,

i_size_read() will call read_seqcount_begin() under 32-bit SMP environment,
and it may loop in __read_seqcount_begin() infinitely because two or more
invocations of write_seqcount_begin interleave and s->sequence becomes
an odd number. It's noted in comments of i_size_write():

/*

For read-only case, this fix will work. However if the inode size is changed
constantly, there will be two or more callers of i_size_write() and the soft-lockup
is still possible.

Moving lock into v9fs_stat2inode() sounds reasonable. There are callers
which don't need it (e.g. v9fs_qid_iget() uses it to fill attribute for a
newly-created inode and v9fs_mount() uses it to fill attribute for root inode),
so i will rename v9fs_stat2inode() to v9fs_stat2inode_nolock(), and wrap
v9fs_stat2inode() upon v9fs_stat2inode_nolock().

I can not follow that. Do you mean inode->i_nlink may be updated concurrently
by v9fs_stat2inode() and v9fs_remove() and that will lead to corruption of i_nlink ?

I also note a race about updating of v9inode->cache_validity. It seems that it is possible
the clear of V9FS_INO_INVALID_ATTR in v9fs_remove() may lost if there are invocations of
v9fs_vfs_getattr() in the same time. We may need to ensure V9FS_INO_INVALID_ATTR is enabled
before clearing it atomically in v9fs_vfs_getattr() and i will send another patch for it.

I see, I wasn't aware of how seqcount worked in details but it is a
simple seq++ with barrier so that does indeed need locking.
I had misunderstood the lockup reason as simply the value being updated
all the time.

You are right. We can still do this as an optimization to not take the
lock in the read-only case, but otherwise it's safe to forget about this
comment.

If it's a newly created inode there is no contention and the spinlock
has virtually no cost ; and v9fs_mount's root inode is the same.
Let's keep this simple and always lock around i_size_write.

Not corruption, but the value can be incoherent for a short while.
If another thread looks at nlink continuously it can see the value being
reset to 1 for a short time when there really is no reason to.

I think this isn't as important as the other issues you've raised, so
don't worry about this point unless you want to.

There are many places setting this flag but that appears correct this
isn't safe.

It's more complicated than what you're saying though, e.g. even if the
flag was already set at the start of v9fs_vfs_getattr, if another thread
"sets it again" while it is running we need not to unset it -- so
basically this needs to be a 3-value:
 - valid
 - invalid
 - invalid-being-refreshed

v9fs_invalidate_inode_attr would set it to invalid regardless of the
previous state.
start of v9fs_vfs_getattr would set it to invalid-being-refreshed (iff
it was invalid? always?)
end of v9fs_vfs_getattr/v9fs_stat2inode would set it back to valid iff
it is invalid-being-refreshed.

You cannot clear the flag at the start of v9fs_vfs_getattr() because
another getattr in parallel needs to know it cannot trust the cached
value; currently that parallel getattr call would issue another stat
request to the server but if we implement this we could wait until the
flag becomes valid (I'm not sure if it's appropriate to poll the value
even if we yield, so this might need a mutex or other lock that can
sleep though...); well, for now it's ok to behave like we currently do
and also proceed on to refresh the attribute in that other thread, we
can think about handling it better incrementally

Thanks,

```
