  "CVE-2019-16409": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The `secureassets` and `versionedfiles` modules can expose versions of protected files.",
    "details": "Users who migrated from a 3.x site that used the `versionedfiles` module will have its `_versions` folders left as artifacts in their public file systems, leaving all the unpublished versions of old files publicly accessible under a guessable URL. This module was superseded by the file versioning functionality provided by the core 4.x recipe, meaning these `_versions` folders have no ongoing functional utility and should be deleted or blocked from web requests.",
    "affected_versions": "^4.0",
    "fixed_versions": "4.3.5, 4.4.4",
     "root_cause": "The `versionedfiles` module in Silverstripe 3.x stored file versions in publicly accessible `_versions` folders. When migrating to Silverstripe 4.x, these folders are not removed or protected, leading to exposure of unpublished file versions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of unpublished versions of files, which may contain sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": "Direct access to the `_versions` folders via guessable URLs.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "No special capabilities are required. An attacker only needs to know the folder structure to access the files."
