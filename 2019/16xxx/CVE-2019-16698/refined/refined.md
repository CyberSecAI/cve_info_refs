Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing access check in the backend module of the "Direct Mail" extension for TYPO3 CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that a backend user, who lacks explicit access to tables containing user data (like `fe_users` or `tt_address`), can still view and export data of users subscribed to newsletters. This occurs because of the missing access control in the backend module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker (a backend user with insufficient permissions) can gain access to sensitive user data, including information about newsletter subscribers. This data could include email addresses, names, or other information stored in the user tables.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the backend module of the "Direct Mail" extension.
*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in backend user, although not having access to the underlying tables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid backend user account within the TYPO3 system.
*   The attacker is specifically required to have backend access without having permissions to the configured tables containing user data (e.g. fe_users, tt_address).

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was present in versions 5.2.2 and below of the Direct Mail extension.
*   The fix is available in version 5.2.3
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Markus Klein.
