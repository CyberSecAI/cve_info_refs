Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the netstring parser within the `STSSocketmapResponder` class in the `postfix_mta_sts_resolver` software. Specifically, the `pynetstring.Decoder` was being instantiated as an instance variable (`self._decoder`) of the `STSSocketmapResponder` class and was thus shared between multiple requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect state handling:** The netstring parser's state was not reset between requests. This could lead to unexpected behavior when handling multiple requests in rapid succession, as the parser would carry over state from the previous request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Downgrade of Effective STS Policy:** Due to incorrect parsing, the daemon could return incorrect responses, leading to a downgrade of the effective MTA-STS policy. This means that a mail server might incorrectly fallback to a less secure or insecure connection, potentially exposing email communications to eavesdropping or manipulation.
- The issue was triggered under "rare conditions"

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending multiple requests to the `mta-sts-daemon` via its socketmap interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the `mta-sts-daemon` socket. This would typically be from the same host or a trusted network segment where the Postfix mail server is running.
- The attacker would need to send crafted requests designed to trigger the state issue in the netstring parser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `postfix-mta-sts-resolver` prior to 0.5.1.
- The fix involves instantiating a new `pynetstring.Decoder` object for each request handled by the `handler` function. This ensures that parser state is not shared between requests, resolving the issue.
- Patches for older versions are available as a workaround [https://gist.github.com/Snawoot/b9da85d6b26dea5460673b29df1adc6b](https://gist.github.com/Snawoot/b9da85d6b26dea5460673b29df1adc6b)
- Patches were also applied in versions 0.3.0, 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 0.4.2, 0.4.3, 0.4.4 and 0.4.5

```

This clearly shows that the decoder was previously an instance variable and has been changed to a local variable inside the handler function.
