{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2019-16317",
    "root_cause": "The application deserializes untrusted data without proper verification, allowing an attacker to control the state or flow of execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By inserting the 'phar' wrapper with an arbitrary path in the filename parameter, an attacker can trigger automatic deserialization leading to the execution of malicious code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a file with a specific filename containing the 'phar' wrapper which causes automatic deserialization.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to upload files or control the filename parameter.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in the `pimcore/pimcore` package, specifically in versions prior to 5.7.1. The fix is to upgrade to version 5.7.1 or higher. The vulnerable code does not properly sanitize the filename before deserialization, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by using the 'phar' wrapper. This is a common issue with deserialization of untrusted data, where input is not validated sufficiently."
