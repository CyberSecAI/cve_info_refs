Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16547:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-16547

**Description:**
The Google Compute Engine Plugin for Jenkins did not verify permissions on multiple auto-complete API endpoints. This allowed users with Overall/Read permissions to view various metadata about the running cloud environment.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is missing permission checks on multiple auto-complete API endpoints within the Google Compute Engine plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate authorization: The plugin does not verify if users have the necessary permissions before allowing access to metadata through the auto-complete API endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Users with Overall/Read permissions, who should not have access to certain metadata, can view sensitive details about the running cloud environment. This could include instance names, configurations, or other potentially sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker with Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance can make requests to the vulnerable auto-complete API endpoints.
- No user interaction is needed once the attacker has obtained the overall/read permissions

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have "Overall/Read" permissions within the Jenkins instance. This implies that an attacker already has some level of access and is an authorized user of the Jenkins system, albeit with limited privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the Google Compute Engine Plugin for Jenkins.
- The plugin version affected is up to and including 4.1.1.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 4.2.0, which now requires the "Job/Configure" permission to view metadata through the auto-complete API endpoints.
