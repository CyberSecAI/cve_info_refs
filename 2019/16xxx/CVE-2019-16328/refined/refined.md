Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing protocol security check in RPyC (Remote Python Call) versions 4.1.x through 4.1.1. This allowed a remote attacker to bypass standard security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Protocol Security Check:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation in the RPyC protocol. Specifically, the attacker could dynamically modify object attributes.
*   **Insecure Object Attribute Modification:** By manipulating object attributes, the attacker could construct a malicious remote procedure call, thus bypassing the intended security mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The most critical impact is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable RPyC service. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server.
*   **Integrity Violation:** The attacker could modify the behavior of a service, potentially leading to unexpected or malicious outcomes.
*   According to the CVSS v3 score the Integrity Impact is High, while Confidentiality and Availability Impact is None.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network connection.
*   **Remote Procedure Call (RPC):** The attack involves manipulating the parameters of a remote procedure call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable RPyC service.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** RPyC versions 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in RPyC version 4.1.2 and later.
*   **Default Configuration:** The vulnerability can be exploited even with default configuration settings of RPyC.
*   **Security Recommendations:** The RPyC documentation advises not to expose RPyC services directly to the internet and recommends using secure local networks or secure connections (e.g., SSL).
*   The vulnerability was present from September 2018 to October 2019.
