Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the "exec" command in CompleteFTP server, which, prior to version 12.1.4, executed arbitrary commands with SYSTEM privileges regardless of the logged-in user's permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Command Execution:** The "exec" command did not properly check user privileges, allowing any authenticated user to execute commands with the highest system privileges.
*   **Lack of Privilege Separation:** The server did not enforce proper privilege separation between user sessions and the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the target server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Because commands are executed as SYSTEM, this allows for a full compromise of the targeted system. Attackers could install malware, modify system configurations, exfiltrate data, or take other actions typical of a complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is through the SSH protocol on the network.
*   **Authenticated Access:** An attacker must have valid credentials for a user account on the CompleteFTP server. The account could be a local Windows account or a domain account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Credentials:** An attacker needs valid login credentials for the CompleteFTP server.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the CompleteFTP server over the network via SSH.
*   **SSH client:** The attacker needs a SSH client capable of sending commands.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided information comes from a vulnerability disclosure, including a proof-of-concept exploit, that is more detailed than the typical CVE description. It identifies the affected component ("exec" command), the privilege level of execution (SYSTEM), and the specific versions affected (< 12.1.4).
*   The provided fix was to limit the "exec" command to Windows Administrator accounts, but the content shows that newer versions have completely removed the command.
*  The provided information includes a proof-of-concept exploit, using Python with the Paramiko library, showcasing the ease of exploitation.
