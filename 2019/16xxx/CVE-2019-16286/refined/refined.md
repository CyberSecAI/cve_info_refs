  "cve_id": "CVE-2019-16286",
  "description": "The HP ThinPro allows administrators to determine what applications users can run, however attackers can bypass these restrictions to spawn restricted applications and run arbitrary commands on the device.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Inadequate application filtering allows bypassing restrictions intended to limit which applications a user can execute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Application filter bypass",
      "Insufficient restrictions on application launching",
      "Insecure handling of file type associations"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can bypass application restrictions to run arbitrary commands on the device, potentially leading to privilege escalation and system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web browser access to configure file type handling",
      "Clickable links that can launch Firefox"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the device or a connection to the device over a network. The attacker needs to be able to access the web browser or a clickable link that can launch Firefox."
