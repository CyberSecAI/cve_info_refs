Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

The content describes five SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpIPAM, affecting all versions. The vulnerabilities are located in the following files:

*   `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit.php`
*   `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit-result.php`
*   `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter.php`
*   `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter-result.php`
*   `/app/admin/custom-fields/order.php`

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the listed PHP files when constructing SQL queries. The `table` parameter is directly used in SQL queries, making it vulnerable to injection.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct inclusion of user-controlled input (specifically the `table` parameter) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other potentially confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database, potentially causing data loss or corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (potentially):** While not directly demonstrated in the provided examples, SQL injection vulnerabilities can sometimes be leveraged to gain code execution on the underlying system in certain database configurations
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Using time-based SQL injection with `sleep()` can cause delays.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable via HTTP requests to the vulnerable files, using the `table` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the phpIPAM instance to send malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Authentication:** The provided examples don't specifically show a requirement for authentication for successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Specific Injection Examples:**

1.  **`edit.php` and `filter.php`**: The attacker uses `table=users\`where 1=(updatexml(1,concat(0x3a,(select user())),1))#\`` to inject an SQL query that extracts the database user via `updatexml()`.

2.  **`edit-result.php` and `order.php`**: The attacker injects `table=users`;select * from users where 1=sleep(10);#` to cause a time-based SQL injection with `sleep()`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided examples use `curl` to demonstrate the attack vectors.
*   The attacker is able to retrieve the database user information and cause delays using time-based injection.
*   The issue was reported as affecting "All phpipam Versions."
