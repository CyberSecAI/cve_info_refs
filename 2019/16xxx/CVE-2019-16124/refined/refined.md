{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application did not perform checks to prevent the regeneration of the configuration file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Remote code execution",
      "Unrestricted file generation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious code into the configuration file, leading to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/install/checkConfiguration.php` endpoint with malicious code embedded in the `salt` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server and know the application URL."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "exploit_details": "The exploit consists of sending a crafted POST request to `install/checkConfiguration.php` containing malicious PHP code in the 'salt' parameter, which is then written into the `configuration.php` file, leading to arbitrary code execution. For example, the provided exploit uses `eval($_REQUEST['zerodayslol']);`.",
    "patch_information": "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to see if the `configuration.php` file already exists. If it does, the script exits without allowing regeneration of the config file.",
    "affected_versions": "YouPHPTube versions 7.4 and earlier are affected.",
    "vendor_fix": "https://github.com/YouPHPTube/YouPHPTube/commit/b32b410c9191c3c5db888514c29d7921f124d883"
