Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16556:

**CVE-2019-16556: Rundeck Plugin stored credentials in plain text**

*   **Root Cause:** The Rundeck Plugin for Jenkins was storing credentials in plain text within its global configuration file (`org.jenkinsci.plugins.rundeck.RundeckNotifier.xml`) and job configuration files (`config.xml`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Credentials, which are sensitive information for accessing Rundeck instances, were stored without any encryption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins master's file system or have 'Extended Read' permission for job configurations can view these plain text credentials.
    *   Compromised credentials could be used to gain unauthorized access to Rundeck instances, potentially leading to further attacks on systems managed by Rundeck.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** Direct access to the Jenkins master's file system where configuration files are stored.
    *   **Jenkins UI Access:** Users with 'Extended Read' permission can view the job configuration files via the Jenkins UI.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have either:
        *   Direct access to the Jenkins master server's file system.
        *   'Extended Read' permission on Jenkins to view job configurations.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory states that Rundeck Plugin version 3.6.6 addresses this issue by storing credentials encrypted when global or job configurations are saved again.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Wadeck Follonier from CloudBees, Inc.

This information provides more detail than a simple CVE description, including the specific files where the credentials were stored, the required access permissions, and the fix.
