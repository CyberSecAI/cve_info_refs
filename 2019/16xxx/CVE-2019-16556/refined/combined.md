SECURITY-1681 / CVE-2019-16549 (XXE) & CVE-2019-16550 (CSRF)
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager
APIs. Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure
the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. While Jenkins
users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a
custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle
attacks, especially if it's not an HTTPS URL.

Additionally, a connection test form validation method does not require
POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow attackers to have Jenkins parse
crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets
from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service
attacks.

SECURITY-1527 / CVE-2019-16551 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16552 (missing permission check)
Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.30.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks
in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
access to perform connection tests, connecting to an HTTP URL or SSH server
using attacker-specified credentials, or determine whether files with an
attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1651 / CVE-2019-16553 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16554 (missing permission check)
 & CVE-2019-16555 (resource consumption)
Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.24.1 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method performing form validation. This allows users
with Overall/Read access to supply a computationally expensive regular
expression that will hang the request handling thread.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1593 / CVE-2019-16564
Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the
information shown on the view it provides, such as stage names or job
names.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by
users able to configure jobs, define pipeline stages, or otherwise affect
the information shown by Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin.

SECURITY-1636 / CVE-2019-16556
Rundeck Plugin 3.6.5 and earlier stores credentials as part of its global
configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.rundeck.RundeckNotifier.xml` and
job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These URLs could be viewed by
users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files)
or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1598 / CVE-2019-16557
Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier stores credentials
unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master as part of its
build step configuration. These credentials can be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1580 / CVE-2019-16558
Spira Importer Plugin 3.2.3 and earlier unconditionally disables SSL/TLS
certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1371 / CVE-2019-16559 (permission check) & CVE-2019-16560 (CSRF)
WebSphere Deployer Plugin 1.6.1 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, determine whether files
with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system,
and obtain limited information about the Jenkins and plugin configuration
based on the responses. The latter include the ability to set plugin
configuration options.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1581 / CVE-2019-16561
WebSphere Deployer Plugin 1.6.1 and earlier allows users with Overall/Read
access to disable SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation for the
entire Jenkins master JVM, or specify a new Java keystore from a file
stored on the Jenkins master filesystem.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1591 / CVE-2019-16562
buildgraph-view Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the description of
builds shown in its view.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users able to change the build description.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1592 / CVE-2019-16563
Mission Control Plugin 0.9.16 and earlier does not escape job display names
and build names in the view it provides.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users able to change these properties.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1605 (1) / CVE-2019-16565 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16566 (missing permission check)
Team Concert Plugin 1.3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks on
a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1605 (2) / CVE-2019-16567
Team Concert Plugin 1.3.0 and earlier provides a list of applicable
credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to
use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1521 / CVE-2019-16568
SCTMExecutor Plugin 2.2 and earlier stores Silk Central credentials in the
global Jenkins configuration and in job `config.xml` files.

While these credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted
in plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in
exposure of these credentials through browser extensions, cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1603 / CVE-2019-16569
Mantis Plugin 0.26 and earlier does not require POST requests on a
connection test method, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. This allows
attackers to have Jenkins connect to Mantis-related paths on an
attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1604 / CVE-2019-16570 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16571 (missing permission check)
RapidDeploy Plugin 4.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check on
form validation methods. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to RapidDeploy-related paths on an attacker-specified
web server.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1597 / CVE-2019-16572
Weibo Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier stores a credential unencrypted in its
global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.weibo.WeiboNotifier.xml`
on the Jenkins master. This credential can be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1600 / CVE-2019-16573 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16574 (missing permission check)
Alauda DevOps Pipeline Plugin 2.3.2 and earlier does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to Kubernetes-related paths on an
attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, capturing token credentials managed by
Alauda DevOps Pipeline Plugin.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1602 / CVE-2019-16575 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16576 (missing permission check)
Alauda Kubernetes Suport Plugin 2.3.0 and earlier does not require POST
requests on a connection test method, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
This allows attackers to have Jenkins connect to Kubernetes-related paths
on an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing 'Secret Text' credentials
stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, if no credentials ID is specified, the connection uses the
default Kubernetes token from
`/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# Rundeck

How to install

* [Documentation](/rundeck/)
* [Releases](/rundeck/releases/)
* [Issues](/rundeck/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/rundeck/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/rundeck/healthscore/)

This plugin is a Notifier that will talk to a [Rundeck](http://www.rundeck.org/) instance (via its HTTP API) to schedule a job execution on Rundeck after a successful build on Jenkins.
 It is also a Trigger that will schedule a build on Jenkins after a job execution on Rundeck (using Rundeck WebHook Notification).
 In addition, it turns Jenkins into an [Option provider](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/tutorials/option-provider.html) for Rundeck, if you want to use your Jenkins build artifacts as an option to a Rundeck job.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin@master/docs/images/logo-rundeck.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/logo-rundeck.png)

**Table of Contents**

## Use

[Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/open-source) is an open-source tool for automating tasks on multiple nodes, with both a CLI and a web-based interface. You can use it to deploy your application to multiple nodes/appserv easily. It has a concept of jobs and build similar to Jenkins.

You have 3 ways to use this plugin :

* build a "**deployment pipeline**", (the "0-click deployment process") : you commit a change, Jenkins picks it up, build, test and so on, and then triggers a job execution on Rundeck for deploying your application. This requires some configuration on Jenkins (both global configuration and job configuration), to link a Jenkins job with a Rundeck job.
* continue your pipeline after the deployment : Rundeck deploys your application, then triggers a build on Jenkins to run some integration tests (Selenium ?). This requires some configuration on Rundeck (WebHook notification) and on Jenkins (Trigger configuration, and optionally filter the notifications from Rundeck).
* use Jenkins as an [**Option provider**](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/tutorials/option-provider.html) for Rundeck : when you execute a Rundeck job, you can have an (input) option, whose values could be retrieve from an external system (here, Jenkins). So you can have a Rundeck-job that use a Jenkins-artifact (from a Jenkins-build) as an input.

Note that you can combine those use-cases.

### Deployment Pipeline

The goal is to have a **0-click deployment process** : you commit a change, Jenkins picks it up, build, test and so on, and then triggers a job execution on Rundeck for deploying your application.
 You can also have an "on-demand" process : configure a "tag" in the job configuration (see below), and the plugin will only notify Rundeck if the tag is present in the SCM changelog (= in the commit message).

#### Configuration

First, you need to configure your Rundeck instance on the main Jenkins configuration page :
 [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin@master/docs/images/jenkins-config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/jenkins-config.png)

As of Rundeck plugin version 3.0, you can specify an Authtoken instead of Login/Password.  Additionally you can set the API version if you need to use a lower number than the latest version.

You can use the "Test Connection" button to make sure that Jenkins can talk to your Rundeck instance :

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| *Error message in case of error* | *Success message when your credentials are valid* |

Then, for each Jenkins job, configure the target Rundeck job that should be executed, along with its options :

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| *The per-job configuration screen* | *If set a Job ID, it will display the job details (group, job name and project)* |

* Note that the "options" should be expressed in the java-properties format, and that Jenkins environment variables are expanded when making the Rundeck API calls (for more details, read the integrated-help in your Jenkins instance by clicking the "?" icon next to the "options" field).
* The "tag" field is used to perform "on-demand" job scheduling on Rundeck : if the value is not empty, we will check if the SCM changelog (= the commit message) contains the given tag, and only schedule a job execution if it is present. For example you can set the value to "#deploy". Note that if this value is left empty, we will ALWAYS schedule a job execution.
* You can choose to wait for the Rundeck job to finish before finishing the Jenkins build. Otherwise, the default behavior is to trigger a Rundeck job, and finish the Jenkins build (usually before the Rundeck job has ended).
* If the last checkbox is checked, then a failure to schedule the job execution on Rundeck will fail the Jenkins build. Otherwise, the Rundeck integration won't interact with the result of your Jenkins build (even if Rundeck is down).

### Post-deployment job

The goal is to continue the deployment pipeline after a successful deployment : Rundeck deploys your application, and triggers a build on Jenkins to run some integration tests (using Selenium for example).

#### Configuration

First, you need to configure the [WebHook Notification](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/manual/notifications/webhooks.html#job-notifications) in your Rundeck jobs. Set it to the url [https://JENKINS\_HOST/plugin/rundeck/webhook/](https://jenkins_host/plugin/rundeck/webhook/).

Then, configure the "Rundeck Trigger" on your Jenkins jobs : activate it, and optionally filter the notifications from Rundeck.

#### Use

If your Jenkins job is started by a Rundeck notification, you can access the data of the Rundeck notification as environment variables :

* **RDECK\_JOB\_ID** : the ID (UUID) of the job
* **RDECK\_JOB\_NAME** : the name of the job
* **RDECK\_JOB\_GROUP** : the group of the job
* **RDECK\_JOB\_DESCRIPTION** : the description of the job
* **RDECK\_PROJECT** : the name of the project
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_ID** : the ID of the execution
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_STATUS** : the status of the execution (one of SUCCEEDED, FAILED or ABORTED)
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_STARTED\_BY** : the user who started the execution
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_STARTED\_AT** : the date at which the execution started
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_ENDED\_AT** : the date at which the execution ended
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_ABORTED\_BY** : the user who aborted the execution (if the status is ABORTED)
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_DURATION\_MILLIS** : the duration of the execution, in milli-seconds
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_DURATION\_SECONDS** : the duration of the execution, in seconds
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_DURATION** : the duration of the execution, as a human-readable string ("3 minutes 34 seconds")
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_SHORT\_DURATION** : the duration of the execution, as a short human-readable string ("0:03:34.187")
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_URL** : the url of the execution (on the Rundeck Web GUI)
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_DESCRIPTION** : the description of the execution
* **RDECK\_EXEC\_ARG\_[NAME]** : the value of a Job option passed to the execution *(plugin version 3.0 or later)*

### Option Provider

Using Jenkins as an [Option provider](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/tutorials/option-provider.html) for Rundeck is very easy, because you don't need to configure anything on the Jenkins side. You just need to point your Rundeck option "remote url" to one of the following url :

#### Option Provider for artifacts

List all artifacts for a given project / build, with a reference to the absolute url of the artifact. Useful if you have multiple artifacts to deploy (one per architecture for example).
 Example (Rundeck screen when executing a job with an "artifact" option, taking its values from Jenkins) :
 [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin@master/docs/images/option-provider-artifact.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/option-provider-artifact.png)

The url : [https://JENKINS\_HOST/plugin/rundeck/options/artifact](https://jenkins_host/plugin/rundeck/options/artifact)

* The parameter **project** is mandatory (name of the job)
* The parameter **build** is optional (default value is 'last'). It could be either a build number, or "last", "lastStable" or "lastSuccessful".
* The parameter **artifactRegex** is optional. It is a java-regex used to filter the artifacts to return (if empty, all artifacts will be returned).

Example : https://JENKINS\_HOST/plugin/rundeck/options/artifact?project=my-job&build=lastSuccessful&artifactRegex=.\*\.war

#### Option Provider for builds

List all builds (versions) for a given project / artifact, with a reference to the absolute url of the artifact. Useful if you have only 1 main artifact, but want to easily re-deploy an older version of the artifact.
 Example (Rundeck screen when executing a job with a "build" option, taking its values from Jenkins) :
 [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin@master/docs/images/option-provider-build.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/rundeck-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/option-provider-build.png)

The url : [https://JENKINS\_HOST/plugin/rundeck/options/build](https://jenkins_host/plugin/rundeck/options/build)

* The parameter **project** is mandatory (name of the job)
* Either the parameter **artifact** (exact filename of the artifact) or **artifactRegex** (java-regex matching the filename of the artifact) is mandatory
* The parameter **limit** is optional. It should be an integer, and is used to limit the number of builds (versions) to return.
* The parameters **includeLastStableBuild**, **includeLastSuccessfulBuild** and **includeLastBuild** are optional booleans. If it is equals to "true", then we will add an entry for the last / last stable / last successful build.

Example : [https://JENKINS\_HOST/plugin/rundeck/options/build?project=my-job&artifact=my-webapp.war&limit=5&includeLastSuccessfulBuild=true&includeLastStableBuild=true](https://jenkins_host/plugin/rundeck/options/build?project=my-job&artifact=my-webapp.war&limit=5&includeLastSuccessfulBuild=true&includeLastStableBuild=true)

#### Option Provider Access

**Note**: Rundeck will call the url anonymously which means the Jenkins job should provide access to Discover and Read the job. See Matrix based security documentation: [https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Matrix-based+security#Matrix-basedsecurity-Job](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Matrix-based%2Bsecurity#Matrix-basedsecurity-Job)

## Compatibility Matrix

This plugin is not compatible with all versions of Rundeck

If you are using Plugin version 3.x and need to access an older Rundeck server, you can set the API version in the plugin settings.

You can find older versions of the plugin here : <https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/rundeck/>

## FAQ

#### Known Issues

* If you have invalid links to Rundeck executions, check your Rundeck configuration : fix the property "grails.serverURL" in the file $RDECK\_HOME/server/config/rundeck-config.properties.
* With the versions 1.x of the plugin, you can't have Rundeck jobs with the same groupPath/jobName on multiple projects.
* Remote options getting 400 server error from Jenkins probably mean you need to grant anonymous access to Discover and Read the Jenkins project

[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager APIs.
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if it’s not an HTTPS URL.

Additionally, a connection test form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow attackers to have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.2 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
It also now requires that requests to the connection test form validation method are done via POST, which protects from cross-site request forgery attacks.
