### @hornersa **[hornersa](/hornersa)** commented [May 29, 2019](#issue-449951489)

For this fix to be applied to 12.x, I needed to add some runtime libraries and upgrade taglibs from 1.0.4. I chose 1.1.2 because this is the version already used by the site/admin-prefs tool in 12.x.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I am not familiar with this templating language, but it seems to me this should be written as follows:

```
<span class='chatNameDate'><span class='chatName'><c:out value="${message.owner}"></span>

```
