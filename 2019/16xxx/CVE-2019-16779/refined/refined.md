{
  "CVE-2019-16779": {
    "description": "There was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.",
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the handling of persistent connections. When a connection is interrupted (e.g., due to a timeout), data might remain in the socket buffer. Subsequent requests on the same connection could then inadvertently read this leftover data intended for a previous response.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition",
      "Data leakage"
    ],
    "impact": "Subsequent requests might receive data from a previous response, potentially leading to information disclosure or unexpected behavior.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could trigger a timeout or connection interruption to leave data on the socket, and then send a subsequent request on the same connection to read the leaked data. The race condition window appears short, making intentional exploitation difficult.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to induce an interruption or timeout of a persistent connection and then make a subsequent request on the same connection. The exploitation is made more complex by the short race condition window.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in versions of rubygem-excon before 0.71.0. The fix involves resetting the connection if it is not reusable due to an interruption. The patch is available at https://github.com/excon/excon/commit/ccb57d7a422f020dc74f1de4e8fb505ab46d8a29."
