  "CVE-2019-16943": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the p6spy (3.8.6) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can find an RMI service endpoint to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload. This issue exists because of com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6DataSource mishandling.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "weakness": "Polymorphic Typing issue",
        "impact": "Remote code execution, arbitrary code execution.",
        "attack_vector": "By providing maliciously crafted input to an externally exposed JSON endpoint.",
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send crafted JSON to the application and have an RMI service endpoint available to exploit.",
          "details":"The vulnerability occurs when `jackson-databind` is configured to use polymorphic type handling for `java.lang.Object` properties, particularly with `enableDefaultTyping()` or using `@JsonTypeInfo` with `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS`. If the application's classpath contains vulnerable classes like `com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6DataSource`, an attacker can supply JSON payloads that cause Jackson to instantiate these classes and invoke their methods, potentially leading to remote code execution."
