The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication responses from an external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based management interface of the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco FMC Software if it is configured to authenticate users of the web-based management interface through an external LDAP server.  For information about which Cisco FMC Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether External Authentication Through LDAP Is Enabled To determine whether external authentication using an LDAP server is configured on the device, administrators can navigate to **System > Users > External Authentication** and look for an External Authentication Object that uses LDAP as the authentication method. The External Authentication Object must be enabled for the FMC to be affected. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software or Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, customers who cannot immediately apply a software fix may evaluate the possibility of disabling LDAP authentication for FMC access and using other authentication methods until a software fix can be applied.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table, the left column lists releases of Cisco FMC Software. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a hotfix patch is available for an affected release.       | Cisco FMC Software Release | First Fixed Release | Hotfix Patch |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 6.1.01 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Not available. |   | 6.1.0 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Sourcefire\_3D\_Defense\_Center\_S3\_Hotfix\_ES-6.1.0.8-2.sh |   | 6.2.02 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Not available. |   | 6.2.12 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Not available. |   | 6.2.22 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Not available. |   | 6.2.3 | 6.2.3.16 (February 2020) | Sourcefire\_3D\_Defense\_Center\_S3\_Hotfix\_DO-6.2.3.16-3.sh.REL.tar |   | 6.3.0 | 6.3.0.6 (May 2020) | Cisco\_Firepower\_Mgmt\_Center\_Hotfix\_AI-6.3.0.6-2.sh.REL.tar |   | 6.4.0 | 6.4.0.7 | Cisco\_Firepower\_Mgmt\_Center\_Hotfix\_U-6.4.0.7-2.sh.REL.tar (for releases 6.4.0.5 and later) Cisco\_Firepower\_Mgmt\_Center\_Hotfix\_T-6.4.0.5-1.sh.REL.tar (for releases 6.4.0.4 and earlier) |   | 6.5.0 | 6.5.0.23 | Not available. |      1.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator: ¬† Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:¬†Local AV:¬†Adjacent AV:¬†Network AV:¬†Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC:¬†Low AC:¬†High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR:¬†None PR:¬†Low PR:¬†High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI:¬†Required UI:¬†None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S:¬†Unchanged S:¬†Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C:¬†None C:¬†Low C:¬†High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I:¬†None I:¬†Low I:¬†High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A:¬†None A:¬†Low A:¬†High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:¬†Unproven  E:¬†Proof-of-Concept  E:¬†Functional  E:¬†High  E:¬†Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:¬†Official-Fix  RL:¬†Temporary-Fix  RL:¬†Workaround  RL:¬†Unavailable  RL:¬†Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:¬†Unknown  RC:¬†Reasonable  RC:¬†Confirmed  RC:¬†Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
