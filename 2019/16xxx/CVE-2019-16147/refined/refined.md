Based on the provided commit diff, this commit addresses a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Liferay Portal.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the title of a journal article was not being properly escaped before being displayed on a web page. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious script into the title of the article, which would then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of output sanitization for user-controlled input (journal article title).
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially:
- Steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate other users.
- Redirect users to malicious websites.
- Deface the web page.
- Perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to create or modify a journal article to include malicious JavaScript within the article's title.
- Users would be vulnerable when viewing the journal article.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit journal articles. This could include being a content creator or exploiting a vulnerability to gain these privileges.
