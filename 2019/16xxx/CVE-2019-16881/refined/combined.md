## Description

Affected versions of this crate is not panic safe within callback functions stream\_callback and stream\_finished\_callback. The call to user-provided closure might panic before a mem::forget call, which then causes a use after free that grants attacker to control the callback function pointer. This allows an attacker to construct an arbitrary code execution .

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Stream callback procedure is not unwind safe #20

## Description

![@Phosphorus15](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15113098?u=86aa724b1519f8cba8d3dedd410c48d4811a4139&v=4&size=48)[Phosphorus15](https://github.com/Phosphorus15)opened [on Sep 13, 2019](https://github.com/mvdnes/portaudio-rs/issues/20#issue-493424396)

It is observed that the `stream_callback` and `stream_finished_callback` functions are not unwind safe, as their definitions shown below.

```
let mut stream_data: Box<StreamUserData<I, O>> = unsafe { mem::transmute(user_data) };
...
let result = match stream_data.callback
    {
        Some(ref mut f) => (*f)(input_buffer, output_buffer, timeinfo, flags),
        None => StreamCallbackResult::Abort,
    };

    mem::forget(stream_data);
```

If the user-provided closure could possibly panic, the `mem::forget` of boxed `StreamUserData` would not be reachable, which causes its memory to be deallocated, thus resulting in an `use after free`.

Since the `StreamUserData` contains two function pointers which might be executed later-on, it is obvious that an *arbitrary code execution* can be constructed maliciously by this way. Therefore, this is highly-vulnerable and should be fixed.
