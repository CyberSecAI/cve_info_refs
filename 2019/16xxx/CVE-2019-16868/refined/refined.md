RELATED: CVE-2019-16868
  
- Vulnerability: Arbitrary file deletion
- Root cause: In admin/data.php line 139, the script iterates through the 'bak' POST parameter and unlinks each value without proper validation.
- Weakness: Lack of validation on the 'bak' POST parameter allows arbitrary file paths to be passed to the unlink() function.
- Attack vector: Attacker can send a POST request to /admin/data.php?action=dell_all_bak with the 'bak' parameter containing the path to the file they want to delete.
- Required capabilities: The attacker needs to be logged into the management background to access /admin/data.php.
- Impact: An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to a denial of service or other malicious outcomes.
