    "CVE-2019-16378": {
      "description": "OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1 is prone to a signature-bypass vulnerability with multiple From: addresses, which might affect applications that consider a domain name to be relevant to the origin of an e-mail message.",
      "extracted_data": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how OpenDMARC handles multiple From: addresses in an email header. It incorrectly processes or validates DMARC records when multiple From: addresses are present.",
        "weaknesses": "The primary weakness is the incorrect parsing and validation of the From header field when it contains multiple email addresses. The DMARC check is performed only on one of the addresses, allowing a bypass of the intended authentication mechanism.",
        "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass spam and abuse filters. By crafting emails with multiple From: addresses, an attacker can make it appear as if the email originated from a legitimate domain (that passes the DMARC check) while actually being sent from a different, potentially malicious, domain.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through sending specially crafted emails with multiple From: addresses where at least one address is DKIM or SPF compliant with DMARC policy while other address is not. This could involve using a legitimate domain along with an attacker-controlled domain.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send emails and craft headers, including the 'From:' and Authentication-Results headers. The attacker can operate remotely."
