## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 30 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC 2.29](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC229 "Changes/GLIBC229")
* [Fully remove deprecated and unsafe functions from libcrypt](/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt "Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt")
* [Boost 1.69](/wiki/Changes/F30Boost169 "Changes/F30Boost169")
* [golang 1.12](/wiki/Changes/golang1.12 "Changes/golang1.12")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Thursday, January 31st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f30
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f30. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f30 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f30
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a gcc build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-01-31 10:10:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f30-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f30 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

### @panpilkarz **[panpilkarz](/panpilkarz)** commented [Jul 30, 2019](#issue-474394119)

This PR fixes vulnerability that allows opendmarc to pass as `example.com` since spf and dkim were not `example.com` in the following example:

Input:

```
From: Support <support@example.com>, Support <support@thedomain.com>
Authentication-Results: mail.example.com; spf=pass smtp.mailfrom=notify@seconddomain.com
Authentication-Results: mail.example.com; dkim=pass (1024-bit key) header.d=thedomain.com header.i=@thedomain.com header.b=\"xxxx\""

```

Output:

```
Authentication-Results: mail.example.com; dmarc=pass (p=quarantine dis=none) header.from=example.com

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

| In light of <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489#section-6.6.1> this looks way too simple. From a quick look I'd say that the proposed fix only parses the first domain and it does not parse/verify each domain as specified in the RFC. |

| I would recommend distros and others apply this (I'm about to do it in Debian).  I tested this by creating a DKIM signed multi-from message. The message was signed by the second body From. An unpatched opendmarc will produce a DMARC pass result (due to DKIM passed and aligned with a body From value), but will show the unsigned domain from the other body From as the passed domain.  After patching, the result is DMARC fail for the first domain listed (same one that showed pass before). This is not the full RFC7489 processing, but it is enough to avoid the related security issue.  I did a code inspection and there is existing code to error out when more than one body From is detected. I think this patch is sufficient for that to get triggered. |

| For the record I am applying this to the Fedora / EPEL package too; it will be in opendmarc-1.3.2-1 on Fedora / EPEL.  I *think* this is the same as <https://sourceforge.net/p/opendmarc/tickets/235/> in the sourceforge tracker. I am unsure what status this github repo has and whether any maintainer is watching it. |

| It's related, but the problem is bigger than that. When I was trying to replicate the attack, I used DKIM only. I used multiple From values to get an incorrect result. Something like: mail from: good.example.whatever ... DKIM signature with d=example.bad ... From: example.com, example.bad The result was DMARC pass for example.com. I believe, but haven't tested, that the referenced issue on sourceforge is another instance about being confused about what the authenticated identity is. It would be useful for someone to test with this patch and see if they can still replicate the issue that's reported there. Scott K |

| Background:  When OpenDMARC was written, the posture of the DMARC community was that this case is so rare that such messages should simply be rejected because, as the RFC says, the kinds of email DMARC aims to deal with never encounter this use case. Accordingly, the filter and library were written on the assumption that they would never see this use case.  Discussion:  As far as I can tell, this patch is really a no-op. The current value passed to this function contains the whole header field value, which is then parsed to find the domain. The patch proposes to pass just the domain, but it's the same domain, so nothing really changes.  Proposal:  If upstream MTAs are not rejecting multi-valued From fields as expected, we'll have to teach this filter to parse and process them. |

| When this was posted, I tested opendmarc both with and without this patch and the behavior is different (see above: [#48 (comment)](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/48#issuecomment-531933226)), so for whatever reason it's not a no-op.  I tested passing mail through postfix and libmilter, so it was representative of what can happen on a live system, not an artificial test architecture.  I don't think 'fix all the MTAs' is a good solution, so I do think it needs addressing here. You already have code to error out in the multi-From case, I think it's enough to apply this change to get it triggered. |

| It may be obvious, but since there seems to be some confusion about why the patch works (and it confused me as well), I just wanted to point out: The reason that it works (looking at opendmarc/opendmarc.c) is that at all places in the code where the From header value is used the `dfc->mctx_fromdomain` is used, which in turn is parsed by local code (`dmarcf_mail_parse_multi`) in opendamrc/parse.c. The only exception to that was passing the whole From header to libopendmarc in `opendmarc_policy_store_from_domain`, which is passed the whole header value which may or may not be parsed to the same domain (using a different parse function within libopendmarc).  Thus, when a DKIM PASS result is stored later and it matches with whatever was identified by libopendmarc as From domain but that does not agree with what was parsed by the local code, we get the wrong result.  In addition to patching any multi-From problems, I think it would be a good idea to use the actual From domain used by libopendmarc when reporting results, e.g., writing the AR-header (I added a function to do just this: [#63](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/63).) |

| I made a different fix for this in commit [bdcda9b](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/commit/bdcda9beceb38fe5dacba09fb41fb4f866249326).  We're already parsing the From field and extracting possibly multiple values, but currently we would quietly take the first one and continue. With the patch, messages with multi-valued From fields are ignored completely by the filter, though there is a new option to reject them instead if that's preferred. The latter provides strict compliance with the advice of RFC 7489 Section 6.6.1; the former is the less-disruptive alternative that also avoids making an inconsistent determination. |

| I know this has been "hanging around" for a while and I believe it is superceded by Murray's recent patch for the multi-from problem. I'm going to mark this wont patch as I think we have an effective solution now.  IF THIS IS IN ERROR -- we can always create a new PR against 1.4.x main branch and I'll have [@thegushi](https://github.com/thegushi) review it.  -Martin ( patch guru ) |

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

Summary : A Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) milter and library
Description :
OpenDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
provides an open source library that implements the DMARC verification
service plus a milter-based filter application that can plug in to any
milter-aware MTA, including sendmail, Postfix, or any other MTA that supports
the milter protocol.

The DMARC sender authentication system is still a draft standard, working
towards RFC status.

The database schema required for some functions is provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/db. The rddmarc tools are provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/contrib/rddmarc.

(resolving [#1415753](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415753>)) and
rddmarc tools, and backports proposed fixes for a [crasher
bug](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1673293>) and [security issue

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 30 on 2020-05-26. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '30'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 30 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1753081#c13)  Ben Cotton    2020-05-26 18:16:42 UTC  ``` Fedora 30 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2020-05-26. Fedora 30 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ``` |  |

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them â but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

I'm skeptical of the patch, but haven't had a chance to look at it in detail.  Unfortunately upstream tends to be slow to react, so it's not clear we'll get a clear resolution quickly.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Headers and development libraries for the OpenDMARC library

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC),

Â builds on the successes of technologies such as DomainKeys Identified Mail

Â (DKIM) and the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to create an infrastructure that

Â enforces policy on domain names that are visible to end users, and creates a

Â feedback framework for identifying and tracking fraudulent use of domain

Â names in email.

Â .

Â This package provides the required header files and development libraries for

Â developing against the OpenDMARC library.

[libopendmarc2](/ubuntu/bionic/%2Bpackage/libopendmarc2):
Library for DMARC validation and reporting

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC),

Â builds on the successes of technologies such as DomainKeys Identified Mail

Â (DKIM) and the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to create an infrastructure that

Â enforces policy on domain names that are visible to end users, and creates a

Â feedback framework for identifying and tracking fraudulent use of domain

Â names in email.

Â .

Â This package provides library for implementing mail validation and reporting

Â for the experimental DMARC standard.

Milter implementation of DMARC

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC),

Â builds on the successes of technologies such as DomainKeys Identified Mail

Â (DKIM) and the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to create an infrastructure that

Â feedback framework for identifying and tracking fraudulent use of domain

Â names in email. It uses OpenDBX as an interface layer to various SQL back

Â ends.

Â .

Â It provides the following new capabilities:

Â .

Â A binding between the domain name seen in the From: field of a message and

Â one or both of the domain names verified by DKIM and SPF;

Â .

Â The capability to request that receivers enforce strict message

Â authentication policy published by the author; and Comprehensive reporting,

Â both forensic and aggregate, regarding suspect messages.

Â .

Â This package contains the OpenDMARC mail filter (Milter) for plugging into

Â Milter-aware MTAs. It implements support for both message reject and DMARC

Â failure reporting.

### @panpilkarz **[panpilkarz](/panpilkarz)** commented [Jul 30, 2019](#issue-474394119)

This PR fixes vulnerability that allows opendmarc to pass as `example.com` since spf and dkim were not `example.com` in the following example:

Input:

```

| In light of <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489#section-6.6.1> this looks way too simple. From a quick look I'd say that the proposed fix only parses the first domain and it does not parse/verify each domain as specified in the RFC. |

| I would recommend distros and others apply this (I'm about to do it in Debian).  I tested this by creating a DKIM signed multi-from message. The message was signed by the second body From. An unpatched opendmarc will produce a DMARC pass result (due to DKIM passed and aligned with a body From value), but will show the unsigned domain from the other body From as the passed domain.  After patching, the result is DMARC fail for the first domain listed (same one that showed pass before). This is not the full RFC7489 processing, but it is enough to avoid the related security issue.  I did a code inspection and there is existing code to error out when more than one body From is detected. I think this patch is sufficient for that to get triggered. |

| For the record I am applying this to the Fedora / EPEL package too; it will be in opendmarc-1.3.2-1 on Fedora / EPEL.

| It's related, but the problem is bigger than that. When I was trying to replicate the attack, I used DKIM only. I used multiple From values to get an incorrect result. Something like: mail from: good.example.whatever ... DKIM signature with d=example.bad ... From: example.com, example.bad The result was DMARC pass for example.com. I believe, but haven't tested, that the referenced issue on sourceforge is another instance about being confused about what the authenticated identity is. It would be useful for someone to test with this patch and see if they can still replicate the issue that's reported there. Scott K |

### **[mskucherawy](/mskucherawy)** commented [Jun 5, 2020](#issuecomment-639687572)

| Background:  When OpenDMARC was written, the posture of the DMARC community was that this case is so rare that such messages should simply be rejected because, as the RFC says, the kinds of email DMARC aims to deal with never encounter this use case. Accordingly, the filter and library were written on the assumption that they would never see this use case.  Discussion:  As far as I can tell, this patch is really a no-op. The current value passed to this function contains the whole header field value, which is then parsed to find the domain. The patch proposes to pass just the domain, but it's the same domain, so nothing really changes.  Proposal:  If upstream MTAs are not rejecting multi-valued From fields as expected, we'll have to teach this filter to parse and process them. |

| When this was posted, I tested opendmarc both with and without this patch and the behavior is different (see above: [#48 (comment)](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/48#issuecomment-531933226)), so for whatever reason it's not a no-op.  I tested passing mail through postfix and libmilter, so it was representative of what can happen on a live system, not an artificial test architecture.  I don't think 'fix all the MTAs' is a good solution, so I do think it needs addressing here. You already have code to error out in the multi-From case, I think it's enough to apply this change to get it triggered. |

| It may be obvious, but since there seems to be some confusion about why the patch works (and it confused me as well), I just wanted to point out: The reason that it works (looking at opendmarc/opendmarc.c) is that at all places in the code where the From header value is used the `dfc->mctx_fromdomain` is used, which in turn is parsed by local code (`dmarcf_mail_parse_multi`) in opendamrc/parse.c. The only exception to that was passing the whole From header to libopendmarc in `opendmarc_policy_store_from_domain`, which is passed the whole header value which may or may not be parsed to the same domain (using a different parse function within libopendmarc).  Thus, when a DKIM PASS result is stored later and it matches with whatever was identified by libopendmarc as From domain but that does not agree with what was parsed by the local code, we get the wrong result.  In addition to patching any multi-From problems, I think it would be a good idea to use the actual From domain used by libopendmarc when reporting results, e.g., writing the AR-header (I added a function to do just this: [#63](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/63).) |

| I made a different fix for this in commit [bdcda9b](https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/commit/bdcda9beceb38fe5dacba09fb41fb4f866249326).  We're already parsing the From field and extracting possibly multiple values, but currently we would quietly take the first one and continue. With the patch, messages with multi-valued From fields are ignored completely by the filter, though there is a new option to reject them instead if that's preferred. The latter provides strict compliance with the advice of RFC 7489 Section 6.6.1; the former is the less-disruptive alternative that also avoids making an inconsistent determination. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1415753#c0)  Andrew J. Schorr    2017-01-23 16:11:11 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Why isn't db/schema.mysql included in the package? It seems suboptimal to have to grab the source in order to extract schema.mysql for setting up the database.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): opendmarc-1.3.2-0.12.el7.x86_64   How reproducible: rpm -ql opendmarc | grep -i schema   Steps to Reproduce: 1. rpm -ql opendmarc | grep -i schema 2. 3.  Actual results: No output.   Expected results: schema.mysql should be in there somewhere, perhaps in doc, where it used to be.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1415753#c1)  Simone Marchioni    2017-03-07 09:08:05 UTC  ``` Same problem here.  +1   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1415753#c2)  Richard Siddall    2018-04-24 15:42:09 UTC  ``` Might be related to <https://sourceforge.net/p/opendmarc/tickets/197/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1415753#c3)  Simone Marchioni    2018-04-24 17:23:06 UTC  ``` Maybe. But in the actual package installed from EPEL there's no SQL file to create the database.

Message-ID: <20190911124319.23022e80@computer>

Subject: OpenDMARC signature bypass with multiple From addresses

Hi,

Protonmail reported about a phishing incident in July:
<https://protonmail.com/blog/bellingcat-cyberattack-phishing/>

This had this somewhat mysterious chapter:
"Furthermore, the attackers attempted to exploit an unpatched
vulnerability in an open source software that is widely used by email
providers in an effort to bypass spam and abuse filters. We were
previously aware of this vulnerability and have already been watching
it for some time, but we will not disclose it here because the software
in question is not developed by ProtonMail, and it has not yet been
patched by the software maintainers. This vulnerability, however, is
not widely known and indicates a higher level of sophistication on the
part of the attackers."

After asking protonmail multiple times for a statement they answered
and I learned that it's about this issue in OpenDMARC:
<https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/48>

It's an issue where by specifying multiple From addresses only one of
them gets DMARC-checked.

There's no reaction from the OpenDMARC developers and it's unclear
whether it's still actively developed. Given this is already actively
exploited I think people should be aware of it and distros should
probably apply the patch from the PR.

Name : opendmarc
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.3.2
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.trusteddomain.org/opendmarc.html>
Summary : A Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) milter and library
Description :
OpenDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
provides an open source library that implements the DMARC verification
service plus a milter-based filter application that can plug in to any
milter-aware MTA, including sendmail, Postfix, or any other MTA that supports
the milter protocol.

The DMARC sender authentication system is still a draft standard, working
towards RFC status.

The database schema required for some functions is provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/db. The rddmarc tools are provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/contrib/rddmarc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update provides the final 1.3.2 release (previously the package was 1.3.2
beta). It also includes the previously-omitted database schema directory
(resolving [#1415753](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1415753>)) and
rddmarc tools, and backports proposed fixes for a [crasher
bug](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1673293>) and [security issue
CVE-2019-16378](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1753081>) from

Name : opendmarc
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.3.2
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://www.trusteddomain.org/opendmarc.html>
Summary : A Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) milter and library
Description :
OpenDMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)
provides an open source library that implements the DMARC verification
service plus a milter-based filter application that can plug in to any
milter-aware MTA, including sendmail, Postfix, or any other MTA that supports
the milter protocol.

The DMARC sender authentication system is still a draft standard, working
towards RFC status.

The database schema required for some functions is provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/db. The rddmarc tools are provided in
/usr/share/opendmarc/contrib/rddmarc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

rddmarc tools, and backports proposed fixes for a [crasher
bug](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1673293>) and [security issue

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1673293#c0)  Tomasz PotÄga    2019-02-07 09:38:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1527782](attachment.cgi?id=1527782&action=diff "Patch fixing the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1527782&action=edit "Patch fixing the issue") Patch fixing the issue  Description of problem:  Malformed DMARC record triggers a bug in libopendmarc, making application crash.  $ host -t txt _dmarc.bbsv2.net _dmarc.bbsv2.net descriptive text "v=DMARC1\; p=reject\; rua=dmarc_agg.net\; ruf=dmarc_fr.net\; rf=afrfruf=dmarc_fr.net\; fo=1\; pct=100\; rf=afrf"  No space before "ruf" tag makes the string longer than expected, returning NULL from a sanitizing function. A wrong operator is being used in the condition, causing a strlen() to be executed on the returned value.  There is a merge request pending upstream, but there seems to be no activity after a year's time:  <https://sourceforge.net/p/opendmarc/code/merge-requests/7/>  (I'm not the author of the MR or the sourceforge ticket, the patch attached is the result of debugging an in-house application).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 1.3.2.0.18.fc29  How reproducible: Parsing a record causing the utility function to return NULL while processing some of the tags (see above).  Additional info: Please see a gdb session attached, a patch is also included for reference.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1673293#c1)  Tomasz PotÄga    2019-02-07 09:39:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1527784](attachment.cgi?id=1527784 "gdb session on a dumped core") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1527784&action=edit "gdb session on a dumped core") gdb session on a dumped core   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1673293#c2)  Steve Siirila    2019-02-28 20:50:08 UTC  ``` Note that the following command can be used to determine whether this bug has been fixed or not:  $ opendmarc-check bbsv2.net Segmentation fault (core dumped) $   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1673293#c3)  Steve Siirila    2019-03-21 13:44:33 UTC  ``` Can anyone provide an update on this patch?

The test I mentioned earlier in this thread, in particular:  $ opendmarc-check bbsv2.net Segmentation fault (core dumped) $  does not cause a core dump after patching a RHEL 7 host with opendmarc-1.3.2-1.el7  As such, it is presumed that opendmarc will not crash for us once we put it into use on our production RHEL 7 MTA servers in the future and receive email from @bbsv2.net addresses.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1673293#c17)  Tomasz PotÄga    2019-10-17 06:25:44 UTC  ``` Yep, the update solves the problem for us, too.

The Fedora updates are now stable and the EPEL updates will go stable in two days (or sooner if they get +3 karma, but that's probably unlikely for a fairly niche package on EPEL).   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1673293#c19)  Fedora Update System    2019-10-19 16:52:08 UTC  ``` opendmarc-1.3.2-1.el6 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.
