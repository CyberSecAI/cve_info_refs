  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2019-16650",
      "description": "The provided information describes vulnerabilities in the virtual media implementation of Supermicro Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). These vulnerabilities, collectively called USBAnywhere, affect Supermicro X9, X10, and X11 platforms.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause lies in multiple design and implementation flaws in the BMC's virtual media functionality.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Plaintext Authentication: The virtual media service allows authentication using plaintext usernames and passwords.",
        "Unencrypted Network Traffic: While encryption is available, it is not enforced, and much of the traffic is sent unencrypted after initial authentication.",
        "Weak Encryption: When encryption is used, it relies on RC4 with a fixed key, which is shared across all Supermicro BMCs and is cryptographically weak.",
         "Authentication Bypass: On X10 and X11 platforms, after a client disconnects, some internal state is not cleared, allowing a new client assigned the same socket file descriptor to inherit the previous client's authorization."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to remotely mount any USB device to a vulnerable server, enabling them to perform various malicious activities such as: booting from a malicious USB image, data exfiltration, and direct manipulation of the system.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote network access to the BMC's virtual media service (TCP port 623).",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities by capturing authentication packets, using default credentials, or even without credentials (using the authentication bypass vulnerability). The attacker does not need to have physical access or previous access to the operating system to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "additional_details": "The advisory lists specific vulnerable Supermicro motherboard models, BIOS versions, and BMC versions. There are also tools available that can be used to decode the virtual media protocol and perform attacks."
