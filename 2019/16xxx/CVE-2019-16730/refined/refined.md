The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16730.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `processCommandUpgrade()` function in the `udpServerSys` service of Skymee Petalk AI and Petwant PF-103 pet feeders is vulnerable to command injection. This is due to the function constructing a shell command string using user-supplied arguments for `/usr/sbin/upgrade.sh` and then executing it via `system_cmd()`, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability in the `processCommandUpgrade()` function.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization of user-supplied arguments used in the shell command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the pet feeder.
- Attackers can gain a root shell on the device without authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted UDP packet to the `udpServerSys` service on port 9003 with a malicious command embedded in the arguments for the "Upgrade" command.
- The attacker must be able to reach the pet feeder's port 9003, which means the pet feeder needs to be connected to a network, and the port should be accessible to the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the pet feeder.
- Ability to send UDP packets to the pet feeder on port 9003.
- Knowledge of the custom binary protocol used by the `udpServerSys` service.

**Technical details:**
- The `processCommandUpgrade()` handler takes string arguments for the upgrade type (“SYS” or “UI”) and the filename of a firmware archive.
- It starts a thread to perform the upgrade, passing these user-controlled strings to the thread.
- Inside the thread, a shell command is constructed using `/usr/sbin/upgrade.sh` and the user-controlled strings, then executed with `system_cmd()`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting shell commands within the filename parameter, which is not sanitized.
- The payload is limited to 24 characters due to a memcpy operation with a size of 0x18 in `processCommandUpgrade()`.
- The provided proof of concept uses netcat to create a bind shell on port 1339 as a way to exploit the vulnerability.
