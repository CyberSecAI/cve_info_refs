Hello,

We find a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in XS 9.0.0, which is reported by Address Sanitizer. We compile and run the xs in linux 64.

The simplified js code:

```
function opt(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) {
    var sb = [arg2];
    var test_bitor = function() {
        return 0;
    };

    var arr = [];
}
obj = {};
count = 0;

(function TestFunc() {
    var a;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1; i++) {
        opt(1.1, {}, {}, 2, {});
    }
    (function outer() {
        count++;
        if (count > 390)
            return;

        (function inner() {
            opt(-5, obj, obj, 10, obj);
            a;
        })();

        with(obj) {
            outer();
        }
    })();
})();

let identifier_array = {};

for (let key in identifier_array) {
    let val = identifier_array[key];
}

```

Output of executing './xst -s crash.js'

```

```

According to the report, fxBeginHost() access memory which should not be allowed. You can get the report too, if you compile XS with -fsanitize option, then just run the xst with the js.

Modify xs/makefiles/lin/xst.mk, add " -fsanitize=address" into C\_OPTIONS (line 61) and LINK\_OPTIONS (line 68), then make it, you will get the xst in /lin/debug which has been instrumented with AddressSanitizer.
