Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper encoding of user-supplied input within the `services_captiveportal_mac.php` file of pfSense. Specifically, the script directly echoes user-provided data (`$_POST['username']` and `$_POST['delmac']`) into the output without using `htmlspecialchars()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS issue. This occurs when user-supplied data is reflected back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization/encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter (`username` or `delmac`). When a victim user visits the crafted URL, the injected JavaScript would execute in the user's browser within the context of the pfSense web interface.
*   This could allow an attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, deface the web interface, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs or POST requests to the `services_captiveportal_mac.php` page.
*   An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a link or loading a web page that sends the malicious crafted input to the vulnerable script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL or POST request.
*   The attacker needs to convince a pfSense user to interact with the malicious URL/request. This usually requires some form of social engineering or phishing.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the pfSense system; the attack is performed via the user's browser.

**Additional details from the github commit:**

*   The commit [d31362b](https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/commit/d31362b69d5d52dc196dc72f66e830cd1e6e9a4f) shows the fix. The fix involves using `htmlspecialchars()` to encode the user-supplied data before it's echoed back to the user. This effectively prevents the XSS vulnerability.
*   The specific lines of code changed include:
    *   `echo gettext("No entry exists for this username:") . " " . $_POST['username'] . "\n";` changed to  `echo gettext("No entry exists for this username:") . " " . htmlspecialchars($_POST['username']) . "\n";`
    *    `echo gettext("No entry exists for this mac address:") . " " . $_POST['delmac'] . "\n";` changed to `echo gettext("No entry exists for this mac address:") . " " . htmlspecialchars($_POST['delmac']) . "\n";`

In summary, the vulnerability is a reflected XSS in pfSense, caused by a lack of output encoding. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through crafted URLs. The vulnerability is fixed by using `htmlspecialchars()` to encode user input before outputting it.
