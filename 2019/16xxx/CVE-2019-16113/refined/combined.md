### A Code Execution Vulnerability in Bludit v3.9.2

Hi,

For CVE ID,so I open a new issue,sorry about that.And I think you haven't completely fixed the bug.

There is a new Code Execution Vulnerability which allow to get server permissions,the path is /bl-kernel/admin/ajax/upload-images.php

#### 2.upload the evil jpg

We can specify the location of the uploaded file by changing the value of the uuid,then upload the evil picture to tmp folder

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35037256/64474313-25c5b100-d1a6-11e9-8e29-bc9f2efc62fa.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35037256/64474313-25c5b100-d1a6-11e9-8e29-bc9f2efc62fa.png)

Successfully reverted to the target file

#### 4. Access the evil file that are written through jpg

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35037256/64474346-76d5a500-d1a6-11e9-8b3d-d1bbef90aab5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35037256/64474346-76d5a500-d1a6-11e9-8b3d-d1bbef90aab5.png)

So I recommend checking the file before uploading it to temporary directory
