Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-16884 from the provided texts:

**Description of Vulnerability:**
*   CVE-2019-16884 is an AppArmor/SELinux bypass vulnerability in runc. It is present in runc versions up to 1.0.0-rc8.
*   The vulnerability is due to `libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go` in runc incorrectly checking mount targets. A malicious Docker image can exploit this to mount over a /proc directory.

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause is an incorrect check of mount targets in `libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go`. The `checkMountDestination` function, intended to prevent mounting over `/proc`, doesn't work as expected because the `dest` argument is resolved to an absolute path before `pivot_root`, while the blacklist is relative to the rootfs.

**Weakness:**
*   Improper validation of mount destinations which leads to AppArmor/SELinux bypass.
*   Incomplete patch for LSM bypass via malicious Docker images that mount over a /proc directory.

**Impact:**
*   AppArmor/SELinux restrictions can be bypassed.
*   Potential for privilege escalation. Malicious Docker images can gain unauthorized access or modify data.
*   Containers can potentially run with more privileged SELinux labels than the default, allowing tasks confined inside the container instance to execute non-expected actions.
*   An attacker can run a malicious Docker image to escape the container and compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A malicious Docker image specifies a volume at /proc

**Affected Software and Versions:**
*   runc versions through 1.0.0-rc8
*   Docker versions through 19.03.2-ce (and other products using runc)
*   Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 and 4.2
*   SUSE CaaS Platform 3.0
*   Multiple NetApp products incorporating Docker.

**Mitigation/Solutions:**
*   Upgrade runc to version 1.0.0\_rc10 or later.
*   Apply the patches provided in Red Hat RHSA-2019:4269, RHSA-2019:3940 and RHSA-2019:4074
*   Apply the patches in SUSE Security Advisory SUSE-SU-2019:2787-1

**Specific Attack Details:**

*   A malicious Docker image can mount over a /proc directory, bypassing AppArmor/SELinux restrictions.
*   An attacker can create a crafted container image with malicious values set on security attributes entry for processes, and mounted on top of container's `/proc`.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
*   Ability to create a malicious Docker image or OCI bundle.
*   (For CVE-2019-19921) Ability to spawn two containers with custom volume-mount configurations.

**Affected Platforms:**
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
*   Fedora
*   openSUSE Leap 15.1
*   SUSE Linux Enterprise Module for Containers
*   NetApp products

**Severity:**
*   Red Hat: Moderate
*   SUSE: Moderate
*   NetApp: High
*   Gentoo: High
