  "CVE-2019-16892": {
    "description": "In Rubyzip before 1.3.0, a crafted ZIP file can bypass application checks on ZIP entry sizes because data about the uncompressed size can be spoofed. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (disk consumption).",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the fact that the uncompressed size of a ZIP entry, as stated in the ZIP file's metadata, can be falsified. The rubyzip library, prior to version 1.3.0, does not validate the reported uncompressed size against the actual data being extracted, allowing attackers to provide a very small uncompressed size in the metadata, while actually sending a significantly larger amount of data, leading to a denial of service by consuming excessive disk space.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the uncompressed size of a zip entry."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by creating a crafted zip file that has a small declared size and a larger actual size when uncompressed, leading to disk exhaustion when extracted.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker crafts a malicious zip file, which has a small uncompressed size in its metadata but contains a much larger amount of data.",
       "The victim attempts to extract the files within the zip archive using vulnerable version of `rubyzip` library."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create zip files with modified metadata and must be able to get a user or application using the vulnerable rubyzip library to open the crafted file.",
