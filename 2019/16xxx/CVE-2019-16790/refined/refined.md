Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file extensions when uploading files via URL and when creating or renaming files within the `tinyfilemanager.php` application. This lack of validation allowed an attacker to upload or create files with malicious extensions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inadequate File Extension Validation:** The application did not properly check file extensions to prevent the upload or creation of executable files (e.g., `.php`, etc).
*   **Missing Input Sanitization:** When renaming files, the application used user-provided filenames directly with the stat command without proper sanitization (using `escapeshellarg()`), making it vulnerable to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a file with a malicious extension (such as `.php`), an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **File system manipulation:** An attacker could use the rename function to achieve command execution, as the file name was not sanitized before being used in the stat function.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Upload from URL:** An attacker could upload a file with a malicious extension by providing a URL to the `tinyfilemanager.php` application.
*   **Edit/Rename Files:** An attacker could rename a file to include malicious code or use special characters in the file name, which were not sanitized before being passed to the `stat` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the `tinyfilemanager.php` application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to understand how the file upload and rename functionalities are vulnerable to exploit this.

**Additional Information from the Commit:**
*   A new function `fm_is_file_allowed()` was created to validate file extensions, and this validation occurs before proceeding with the upload. This function checks if the lowercase extension of the uploaded filename is present in the list of allowed extensions defined in `FM_EXTENSION` constant.
*  The fix included sanitization of the filename argument for the stat command using `escapeshellarg()`.
*   The commit notes that files must have an extension to be uploaded under the current fix.
*   The fix was implemented in version 2.3.9.
