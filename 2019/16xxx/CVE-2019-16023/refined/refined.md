    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-16023",
    "vulnerability_details": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect processing of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes.",
    "affected_components": "Cisco IOS XR Software running a vulnerable release later than 6.6.1 and configured for BGP on a device with the L2VPN EVPN address family. Some device EVPN configurations, such as the load-balancing-mode port-active configuration, can also cause devices to be vulnerable without specific L2VPN configurations.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed by an affected system.",
    "impact_of_exploitation": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "To exploit these vulnerabilities, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.",
    "remediation": "Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.",
    "fixed_releases": [
      "6.6.3",
      "7.0.2",
