### Description

Affected versions of this crate would call `Vec::set_len` on an uninitialized
vector with user-provided type parameter, in an interface of the HDR image
format decoder. They would then also call other code that could panic before
initializing all instances.

This could run Drop implementations on uninitialized types, equivalent to
use-after-free, and allow an attacker arbitrary code execution.

Two different fixes were applied. It is possible to conserve the interface by
ensuring proper initialization before calling `Vec::set_len`. Drop is no longer
called in case of panic, though.

Starting from version `0.22`, a breaking change to the interface requires
callers to pre-allocate the output buffer and pass a mutable slice instead,
avoiding all unsafe code.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Third part of the effort of removing `unsafe` from the library, the hdr

decoder actually required an interface change. Several other instances

had been removed in earlier commits. The method would use `Vec::set_len`

even though it did not have full control over the type parameter, as it

was a public interface.

Now simply requires the memory into which to emplace the result to be

provided and allocated externally. This makes the callers responsible

for correct optimization.

Removes the optimization for the library internal structures; it is

expected that the compiler picks up on the pattern well enough for it to

not be the main bottleneck.

Leaves the instances that are deprecated methods, they should enjoy some

deprecation period afterall and are not inherently bad as they are

correctly marked with `unsafe` themselves.

| I fear so, but I didn't realize until a few days ago that it was actually that severe in the old interface, was always under the impression that our own type (non-`Drop`) would be dropped, not the type parameter. Hence the backport.  [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel) Thanks for the reminder, should probably get an advisory for this. |
