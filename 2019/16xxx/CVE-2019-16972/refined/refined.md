Based on the information provided, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16972:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** FusionPBX v4.5.7 and earlier

**Location:** `app/contacts/contact_addresses.php`

**Root Cause:** The `contact_addresses.php` file uses an unsanitized `id` variable from the URL. This variable is reflected in the HTML output without proper sanitization, leading to XSS.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `id` parameter. If an authenticated user clicks on this URL, the JavaScript code will be executed in their browser within the context of the FusionPBX application.

**Impact:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the web page
*   Redirection to malicious websites
*   Other client-side attacks

**Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and entice an authenticated user to click on it. This could be achieved through social engineering or other means.

**Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in FusionPBX by properly sanitizing the `id` variable before reflecting it in the HTML output.

**Additional details from the provided Github diff:**
The fix appears to involve URL encoding the `contact_uuid` parameter when constructing the link to `contact_address_edit.php`. This likely prevents the injection of malicious code through this parameter.
