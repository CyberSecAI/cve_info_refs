# CVE-2019-16929: Security Vulnerability in auth0.net

**Published**: 10/03/2019

**CVE number**: CVE-2019-16929

**Credit**: Dennis Detering (Spike Reply GmbH)

## Overview

Versions of [auth0.net](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net) and associated NuGet Package [Auth0.AuthenticationAPI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.AuthenticationApi/) from `5.8.0` to `6.5.3` inclusive include a class named `IdentityTokenValidator` with a public `ValidateAsync` method, that performs limited validation suitable only for auth0 issued tokens.

## Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

* You are using the `IdentityTokenValidator` to validate untrusted ID tokens
* You are using a version of Auth0.AuthenticationAPI between `5.8.0` and `6.5.3` inclusive

## How to fix that?

Developers should not use the `IdentityTokenValidator` class to validate untrusted ID tokens. See [Validate ID Tokens](/docs/secure/tokens/id-tokens/validate-id-tokens) for our recommendations for validating ID tokens. <https://jwt.io/> is a good resource on open source JWT validation libraries and their capabilities. Note that additional logic may be required based upon your use case.

Developers using the [auth0.net](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net) and associated NuGet Package [Auth0.AuthenticationAPI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Auth0.AuthenticationApi/) between `5.8.0` and `6.5.3` inclusive should upgrade to the latest version `6.5.4` to prevent accidental usage of the `IdentityTokenValidator` class.

### Will this update impact my users?

No. This fix patches the client library that your application runs, but will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

### 7x fastervulnerability fixes with GitHub2

2This 7X times factor is based on data from the industry’s longest running analysis of fix rates Veracode State of Software Security 2023, which cites the average time to fix 50% of flaws as 198 days vs. GitHub’s fix rates of 72% of flaws with in 28 days which is at a minimum of 7X faster when compared.

### 90% coverage[of alert types in all supported languages with Copilot Autofix](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/codeql-query-suites)

## Work together, achieve more

Collaborate with your teams, use management tools that sync with your projects, and code from anywhere—all on a single, integrated platform.

## Documentation

* [Docs site](https://www.auth0.com/docs) - explore our docs site and learn more about Auth0.

## Getting started

### Requirements

This library supports .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.2 as well as later versions of both.

### Management API

#### Installation

```
Install-Package Auth0.ManagementApi
```

#### Usage

Generate a token for the API calls you wish to make (see [Access Tokens for the Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tokens)). Create an instance of the `ManagementApiClient` class with the token and the API URL of your Auth0 instance:

```
var client = new ManagementApiClient("your token", new Uri("https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/api/v2"));
```

The API calls are divided into groups which correlate to the [Management API documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2). For example all Connection related methods can be found under the `ManagementApiClient.Connections` property. So to get a list of all database (Auth0) connections, you can make the following API call:

```
await client.Connections.GetAllAsync("auth0");
```

### Authentication API

#### Installation

```
Install-Package Auth0.AuthenticationApi
```

#### Usage

To use the Authentication API, create a new instance of the `AuthenticationApiClient` class, passing in the URL of your Auth0 instance, e.g.:

```
var client = new AuthenticationApiClient(new Uri("https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN"));
```

#### Authentication

This library contains [URL Builders](https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/#using-url-builders) which will assist you with constructing an authentication URL, but does not actually handle the authentication/authorization flow for you. It is suggested that you refer to the [Quickstart tutorials](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstarts) for guidance on how to implement authentication for your specific platform.

**Important note on state validation**: If you choose to use the [AuthorizationUrlBuilder](https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/api/Auth0.AuthenticationApi.Builders.AuthorizationUrlBuilder.html) to construct the authorization URL and implement a login flow callback yourself, it is important to generate and store a state value (using [WithState](https://auth0.github.io/auth0.net/api/Auth0.AuthenticationApi.Builders.AuthorizationUrlBuilder.html#Auth0_AuthenticationApi_Builders_AuthorizationUrlBuilder_WithState_System_String_)) and validate it in your callback URL before exchanging the authorization code for the tokens.
