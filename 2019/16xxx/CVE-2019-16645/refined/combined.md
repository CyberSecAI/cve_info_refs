## User Comments

### Here are some comments from GoAhead users.

"I've looked at the source code and love it. Very crisp and to the point, no fluff. Well structured, great data structures, very portable, clearly the product of an expert programmer."

— Dwight Vandenberghe, Pentasoft Corporation

"We have carefully evaluated several existing open source Web servers suitable for development. The GoAhead embedded web server was by far the best solution. We managed to port it in a few hours. That's the proof of a good design and careful coding. Wish your company all the best. Thanks for opening the code."

— Eric Valette Canon

"I've compiled GoAhead embedded web server on a number of platforms and been highly impressed by the simplicity and speed of installation. The small footprint and straightforward scripting capabilities are ideal for such applications."

— Tim Nichols, Real Time Systems Group

# Frequently Asked Questions

## If you canât find what youâre looking for, email us at support@embedthis.com .

### Where did GoAhead come from?

The GoAhead embedded HTTP server was originally written by Embedthis staff when working at GoAhead Software in 1998. Since then, GoAhead has been deployed in hundreds of products and hundreds of millions of devices. It remains very popular to this day. With the acquisition of GoAhead Software Inc. by Oracle, Oracle asked Embedthis to support existing GoAhead customers and to provide ongoing development and commercial licenses for the GoAhead embedded web server.

## How does GoAhead compare with Ioto?

GoAhead is a simple, compact web server that is useful for small devices without much memory. It is easily ported and has been ported to many embedded operating systems. [Ioto](/ioto/index.html) is our latest generation web server. It embodies over 20 years of experience with embedded web servers. It is simpler and faster, yet offers more extensive capabilities. We recommend using Ioto for all new products. For more detail, read the [Web Server Comparison](/ioto/comparison.html).

## Is Embedthis enhancing the GoAhead Embedded Web Server?

Embedthis is continuing to provide security and maintenance updates for GoAhead, but the majority of our development energies are now behind the Ioto web server. We recommend that new device projects use Ioto for their embedded web server needs.

## I have products based on GoAhead 2.1. How can I upgrade?

We have released a special security update version GoAhead 2.2. This is designed to provide an easy upgrade path. It provides fixes for all known security issues and bugs while maintaining 100% API compatibility with GoAhead 2.1.8. Read more at [GoAhead 2 Security Update](/blog/2021/goahead-2.html) or contact sales@embedthis.com.

# Exploit Title: GoAhead Web server HTTP Header Injection.# Shodan Query: Server: Goahead# Discovered Date: 05/07/2019# Exploit Author: Ramikan# Vendor Homepage: https://www.embedthis.com/goahead/# Affected Version: 2.5.0 may be others.# Tested On Version: 2.5.0 in Cisco Switches and Net Gear routers.# Vendor Fix: Update to latest Version# CVE : CVE-2019-16645# CVSS v3.1: 8.6 ( AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N)# Category: Hardware, Web Apps# Reference : www.fact-in-hack.blogspot.com
Vulnerability: Host Header Injection
A Host Header Injection vulnerability may allow an attacker to spoof a particular Host header, allowing the attacker to render arbitrary links that point to a malicious website with poisoned Host header webpages.
An issue was discovered in GoAhead web server version 2.5.0 (may be affected on other versions too). The values of the 'Host' headers are implicitly set as trusted while this should be forbidden, leading to potential host header injection attack and also the affected hosts can be used for domain fronting. This means affected hosts can be used by attackers to hide behind during various other attack
PS: Affected on most of embedded webservers on hardware such as switches, routers, IOT and IP cameras.
