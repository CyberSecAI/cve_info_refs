## About the plugin

This plugin integrates with Jenkins the [Atlassian Jira Software](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/) (both Cloud and Server versions). For bug reports, see [bugs](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?filter=14761) or [all open issues](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?filter=14956). For documentation, see [official plugin site](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira).

## Compatibility

For plugin compatibility with [Pipeline plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin), see [COMPATIBILITY](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Configuring the plugin

### Configuration for Jira Cloud

With Atlassian Jira Cloud, it's not possible to create a user without an email, so you need to create API token that will be used as a *service user* by Jenkins to execute API calls to Jira Cloud - follow [Atlassian API tokens documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html)

Then create a global Jenkins credential:

* put *Atlassian ID email* as username
* *API token* as password.

You can check if your API token works correctly by getting a correct JSON issue response with this command (where TEST-1 is an example issue in your project):

```
curl -X GET -u <email>:<API token> -H "Content-Type: application/json"  https://<YourCloudInstanceName>.atlassian.net/rest/api/latest/issue/TEST-1
```

Also make sure that CAPTCHA is not triggered for your user as this will prevent the API token to work - see [CAPTCHA section in Atlassian REST API documentation.](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-basic-authentication/)

### System properties

* *-Dhudson.plugins.jira.JiraMailAddressResolver.disabled=true*

  Use to disable resolving user email from Jira usernames. Currently there is no option for this in UI.

### Using Jira REST API

This plugin has an optional feature to update Jira issues with a back pointer to Jenkins build pages. This allows the submitter and watchers to quickly find out which build they need to pick up to get the fix.

[![plugin-configuration](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/Plugin_Configuration.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/Plugin_Configuration.png)

### Jira Issue links in build Changelog

When you configure your Jira site in Jenkins, the plugin will automatically hyperlink all matching issue names to Jira.

If you have additionally provided username/password to Jira, the hyperlinks will also contain tooltips with the issue summary.

[![example-annotated-changelog](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/example_annotated_changelog.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/example_annotated_changelog.png)

### Updating Jira issues with back pointers

If you also want to use this feature, you need to supply a valid user id/password. If you need the comment only to be visible to a certain Jira group, e.g. *Software Development*, enter the groupname.

Now you also need to configure jobs. I figured you might not always have write access to the Jira (say you have a Jenkins build for one of the Apache commons project that you depend on), so that's why this is optional.

The following screen shows how a Jira issue is updated:

[![jira-comments](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/Jira_Comments.jpg)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/Jira_Comments.jpg)

By taking advantages of Jenkins' [fingerprint](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Fingerprint) feature, when your other projects that depend on this project pick up a build with a fix, those build numbers can also be recorded in Jira.

This is quite handy when a bug is fixed in one of the libraries, yet the submitter wants a fix in a different project. This happens often in my work, where a bug is reported against JAX-WS but the fix is in JAXB.

For curious mind, see [this thread for how this works behind the scene](http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/How-can-does-Hudson-Jira-integration-works-td374680.html).

### Referencing Jira Release version

To reference Jira Release versions in your build, you can pull these releases directly from Jira by adding the Jira Release Version Parameter.

This can be useful for generating release notes, trigerring parameterized build, etc.
 [![version-parameters](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/version_parameters.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/version_parameters.png)

### Generating Release Notes

You can also generate release notes to be used during your build. These notes can be retrieved from an environment variable. See the [Maven Project Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Maven%2BProject%2BPlugin) for the environment variables found within the POM.
 [![release-notes](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/release_notes.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/release_notes.png)

After your build has run, you can also have the plugin mark a release as resolved. This typically will be a release you specified in your Build Parameters.
 [![marking-as-resolved](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/mark_as_resolved.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/mark_as_resolved.png)

The plugin can also move certain issues matching a JQL query to a new release version.
 [![moving-issues](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/move_issues.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/move_issues.png)

Sample usage of generated Release Notes: [![release-notes-config](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/jira-plugin@master/docs/images/release_notes_config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/release_notes_config.png)

### Jira Authentication & Permissions required

**Note:** As a rule of thumb, **you should be always using a service account** (instead of a personal account) to integrate Jenkins with Jira.

Make sure that the Jira user used by Jenkins has enough permissions to execute its actions. You can do that via Jira Permission Helper tool.

* For creating Jira issues, the user has to be able to Create Issues in the specified project
* If you additionally enter assignee or component field values, make sure that: - both of the fields are assigned to the corresponding Jira Screen - the Jira user is Assignable in the project - the Jenkins Jira user can Assign issues

### Related Resources

* Check also the Marvelution [Jenkins Integration for Jira](https://www.marvelution.com/products/jenkins-integration-for-jira/) which provides a two-way solution (Jenkins->Jira and Jira->Jenkins)
* For Jira Workflow (Pipeline) plugin compatibility see [COMPATIBILITY.md](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jira-plugin/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md)

#### Common issues

##### Jenkins<>Jira SSL connectivity problems

If you encounter stacktrace like this:

```
Caused by: javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target

```

make sure the JRE/JDK that Jenkins master is running (or the Jenkins slaves are running) contain the valid CA chain certificates that Jira is running with. You can test it using this [SSLPoke.java class](https://gist.github.com/warden/e4ef13ea60f24d458405613be4ddbc51):

```
$ wget -O SSLPoke.java https://gist.githubusercontent.com/warden/e4ef13ea60f24d458405613be4ddbc51/raw/7f258a30be4ddea7b67239b40ae305f6a2e98e0a/SSLPoke.java

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1658
/
CVE-2019-16538**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through closure default parameter expressions.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Support Core Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to delete arbitrary files

**SECURITY-1634
/
CVE-2019-16539 (permission check), CVE-2019-16540 (path traversal)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`support-core`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/support-core)**

**Description:**

Support Core Plugin did not validate the paths submitted for the "Delete Support Bundles" feature.
This allowed users to delete arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system accessible to the OS user account running Jenkins.

Additionally, this endpoint did not perform a permission check, allowing users with Overall/Read permission to delete support bundles, and any arbitrary other file, with a known name/path.

Support Core Plugin now only allows the deletion of support bundles and related files listed on the UI through this feature.
It also ensures that only users with "Download Bundle" permission are able to delete support bundles.

### Folder-scoped Jira sites in Jira Plugin were able to access System-scoped credentials

**SECURITY-1106
/
CVE-2019-16541**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jira`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira)**

**Description:**

Jira Plugin allows the definition of per-folder Jira sites.

The credentials lookup for this feature did not set the appropriate context, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for use in the global configuration.
This allowed users with Item/Configure permission on the folder to access credentials they’re not entitled to, and potentially capture them.

Jira Plugin now defines the appropriate folder context for credential lookup.
As a side effect, existing per-folder Jira sites may lose access to already configured System-scoped credentials, as if no credential was specified in the first place.

### Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1539
/
CVE-2019-16542**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`anchore-container-scanner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/anchore-container-scanner)**

**Description:**

Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored an Anchore.io service password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As the affected functionality has been deprecated, and the affected Anchore.io service has been shut down in late 2018, the affected feature has been removed.
The password will be removed from the job configuration once it is saved again.

### Spira Importer Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1554
/
CVE-2019-16543**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`inflectra-spira-integration`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/inflectra-spira-integration)**

**Description:**

Spira Importer Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.inflectra.spiratest.plugins.SpiraBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
This credential could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Spira Importer Plugin now stores this credential encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

### Google Compute Engine Plugin did not verify SSH host keys

**SECURITY-1584
/
CVE-2019-16546**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin did not use SSH host key verification when connecting to VMs launched by the plugin.
This lack of verification could be abused by a MitM attacker to intercept these connections to attacker-specified build agents without warning.

Google Compute Engine Plugin now verifies SSH host keys before executing any commands on agents.

### Google Compute Engine Plugin disclosed environment information to users with Overall/Read permission

**SECURITY-1585
/
CVE-2019-16547**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin did not verify permissions on multiple auto-complete API endpoints.
This allowed users with Overall/Read permissions to view various metadata about the running cloud environment.

Google Compute Engine Plugin now requires the appropriate Job/Configure permission to view these metadata.

### CSRF vulnerability in Google Compute Engine Plugin allowed provisioning agents

**SECURITY-1586
/
CVE-2019-16548**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin did not require POST requests on an API endpoint.
This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to provision new agents.

Google Compute Engine Plugin now requires POST requests for this API endpoint.

### QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-727 (1)
/
CVE-2019-16544**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`qmetry-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/qmetry-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its post-build step configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted once the job configuration is saved again.

### QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin shows plain text password in configuration form

**SECURITY-727 (2)
/
CVE-2019-16545**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`qmetry-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/qmetry-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stores a credential as part of its post-build step configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin 1.13, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1658 / CVE-2019-16538
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
closure default parameter expressions.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1634 / CVE-2019-16539 (permission check), CVE-2019-16540 (path traversal)
Support Core Plugin did not validate the paths submitted for the "Delete
Support Bundles" feature. This allowed users to delete arbitrary files on
the Jenkins master file system accessible to the OS user account running
Jenkins.

Additionally, this endpoint did not perform a permission check, allowing
users with Overall/Read permission to delete support bundles, and any
arbitrary other file, with a known name/path.

SECURITY-1106 / CVE-2019-16541
JIRA Plugin allows the definition of per-folder Jira sites.

The credentials lookup for this feature did not set the appropriate
context, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved
for use in the global configuration. This allowed users with Item/Configure
permission on the folder to access credentials they’re not entitled to,
and potentially capture them.

SECURITY-1539 / CVE-2019-16542
Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored an Anchore.io service
password unencrypted in job config.xml files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1554 / CVE-2019-16543
Spira Importer Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global
configuration file com.inflectra.spiratest.plugins.SpiraBuilder.xml on the
Jenkins master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to
the master file system.

SECURITY-1584 / CVE-2019-16546
Google Compute Engine Plugin did not use SSH host key verification when
connecting to VMs launched by the plugin. This lack of verification could
be abused by a MitM attacker to intercept these connections to
attacker-specified build agents without warning.

SECURITY-1585 / CVE-2019-16547
Google Compute Engine Plugin did not verify permissions on multiple
auto-complete API endpoints. This allowed users with Overall/Read
permissions to view various metadata about the running cloud environment.

SECURITY-1586 / CVE-2019-16548
Google Compute Engine Plugin did not require POST requests on an API
endpoint. This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to provision new
agents.

SECURITY-727 (1) / CVE-2019-16544
QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in
job config.xml files on the Jenkins master as part of its post-build step
configuration. This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read
permission or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-727 (2) / CVE-2019-16545
QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stores a credential as part of
its post-build step configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since QMetry for JIRA -
Test Management Plugin 1.13, it is transmitted in plain text as part of
the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the password
through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and
similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
