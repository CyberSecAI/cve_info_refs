Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16541:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Jira plugin allowed the definition of per-folder Jira sites.
*   The credentials lookup for this feature did not set the appropriate context, leading to the use of System-scoped credentials, which are meant for the global configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Context for Credentials Lookup:** The plugin failed to properly set the folder context when looking up credentials for per-folder Jira sites.
*   **Access to System-Scoped Credentials:** Because of the incorrect context, folder-scoped configurations could access and utilize credentials that were intended to be used only for global configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Credential Access:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission on a folder could access system-scoped credentials they were not authorized to use.
*   **Potential Credential Capture:**  The accessed credentials could potentially be captured or extracted by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to have at least `Item/Configure` permissions on a folder within Jenkins.
*   The attacker exploits the lack of proper context during credential lookup in the Jira plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have legitimate access to Jenkins with `Item/Configure` permission on at least one folder.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be an administrator.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory notes that as a side effect of the fix, existing per-folder Jira sites might lose access to system-scoped credentials, as if no credential was specified in the first place.
*   The fix involves defining the appropriate folder context for credential lookup within the Jira plugin.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
