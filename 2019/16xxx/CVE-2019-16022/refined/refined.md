The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect processing of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The system is vulnerable to malformed BGP EVPN update messages.
- Incorrect handling of crafted EVPN attributes in BGP update messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed by the affected system.
- The malicious BGP update message must come from a configured, valid BGP peer or be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a valid BGP peer or have the ability to inject the crafted message into a valid TCP connection to a BGP peer of the affected system.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
