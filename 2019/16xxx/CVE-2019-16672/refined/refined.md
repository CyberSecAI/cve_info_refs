Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of encryption for sensitive credentials data during transmission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive credentials (usernames, passwords)
- Potential for unauthorized access, modification or complete compromise of affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks where an attacker intercepts network traffic.
- No user interaction is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path to capture the transmitted data.
- No prior authentication to the device is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory specifies that the web interface can be accessed through cleartext (unencrypted) HTTP, thereby exposing credentials.
- The solution involves configuring the web interface to use HTTPS, forcing encrypted communication for web interface access.
- The vulnerability is found in Weidmueller Industrial Ethernet managed switches of the IE-SW-VL05M, IE-SW-VL08MT, IE-SW-PL08M, IE-SW-PL10M, IE-SW-PL16M, IE-SW-PL18M, IE-SW-PL09M series with specific firmware versions.
- Patched firmware is required for the IE-SW-VL05M and IE-SW-VL08MT series to fully resolve the vulnerability, while the other series can be addressed by configuring "HTTPS only" mode in the web interface.
