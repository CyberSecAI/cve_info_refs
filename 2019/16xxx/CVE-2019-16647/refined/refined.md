The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16647.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an unquoted search path in Maxthon Browser for Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The presence of an unquoted search path allows an attacker to introduce a malicious executable in a directory within the search path, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The specific vulnerable executable appears to be `mxservice.exe`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to place a malicious executable with the same name as one of the Maxthon Browser executables into a directory earlier in the system's search path. When Maxthon Browser attempts to launch the intended executable, the attacker's malicious executable would be launched instead.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have write access to a directory in the system's search path before the directory where the intended Maxthon Browser executable is located.

The forum discussion also mentions that the portable version of Maxthon Browser does not have the vulnerable `mxservice.exe`, and the issue was fixed in version 5.3.8.2000.
