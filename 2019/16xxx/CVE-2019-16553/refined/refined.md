The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16553.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Build Failure Analyzer Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method performing form validation, and this method does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Missing permission check: Users with Overall/Read access can access the vulnerable method.
*   CSRF vulnerability: The form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   ReDoS vulnerability:  The lack of proper input validation allows users to submit a computationally expensive regular expression.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Users with Overall/Read access can hang the request handling thread, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker with Overall/Read permissions sends a crafted request with a computationally expensive regular expression to the form validation method.
*   The lack of CSRF protection allows an attacker to trick a user into sending the crafted request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
*   Ability to send crafted HTTP requests or trick a user into sending one.
