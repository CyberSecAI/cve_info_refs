## Affected versions

## Patched versions

0.8.1

## Description

An issue was discovered in the blake2 crate before 0.8.1 for Rust. The BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s algorithms, when used with HMAC, produce incorrect results because the block sizes are half of the required sizes.

Patched

* `>=0.8.1`

### Description

When used in conjunction with the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC),
the BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s implementations in `blake2` crate versions prior to
v0.8.1 used an incorrect block size (32-bytes instead of 64-bytes for BLAKE2s,
and 64-bytes instead of 128-bytes for BLAKE2b), causing them to miscompute the
`MacResult`.

The v0.8.1 release of the `blake2` crate uses the correct block sizes.

Note that this advisory only impacts usage of BLAKE2 with HMAC, and does not
impact `Digest` functionality.

## Description

![@rot256](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7559534?u=fab6d8f2bd7186e35aeb0f9f5367f8a2c51ff3b5&v=4&size=48)[rot256](https://github.com/rot256)opened [on Aug 25, 2019](https://github.com/RustCrypto/MACs/issues/19#issue-484978241)

I seem to be getting incorrect results when using the [hmac](https://docs.rs/hmac/0.7.1/hmac/) crate with [blake2s](https://docs.rs/blake2/0.8.0/blake2/). I have verified that the implementation of the hash functions themselves behave identically.

## HMAC-Blake2s : mismatching output

MACing the empty message with the empty key, using Go `/x/crypto` for reference:

```
package main

import (
	"crypto/hmac"
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"golang.org/x/crypto/blake2s"
	"hash"
)

func main() {
	var sum [blake2s.Size]byte
	mac := hmac.New(func() hash.Hash {
		h, _ := blake2s.New256(nil)
		return h
	}, []byte{})
	mac.Sum(sum[:0])
	fmt.Println(hex.EncodeToString(sum[:]))
}
```

[Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/SZx3Qy6-TPA)

Outputs `eaf4bb25938f4d20e72656bbbc7a9bf63c0c18537333c35bdb67db1402661acd`

```
use blake2::Blake2s;
use hex;
use hmac::Hmac;
use hmac::Mac;

fn main() {
    let mac = Hmac::<Blake2s>::new_varkey(&[]).unwrap();
    println!("{}", hex::encode(mac.result().code()));
}
```

Outputs `972c8a67004c0a295f6aa879b2130cada52849501e36bd1791b588a356ea852f`

## HMAC-SHA256 : identical output

The same behaviour does not occur when instantiating HMAC with SHA256:

```
package main

import (
	"crypto/hmac"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var sum [sha256.Size]byte
	mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte{})
	mac.Sum(sum[:0])
	fmt.Println(hex.EncodeToString(sum[:]))
}
```

[Go Playgound](https://play.golang.org/p/Z_oo_66-91d)

Outputs `b613679a0814d9ec772f95d778c35fc5ff1697c493715653c6c712144292c5ad`

```
use hex;
use hmac::Hmac;
use hmac::Mac;
use sha2::Sha256;

fn main() {
    let mac = Hmac::<Sha256>::new_varkey(&[]).unwrap();
    println!("{}", hex::encode(mac.result().code()));
}
```

Outputs `b613679a0814d9ec772f95d778c35fc5ff1697c493715653c6c712144292c5ad`

I have reason to believe the Rust implementation is at fault: the Go code is used in `wireguard-go` and successfully performs cryptographic handshakes with other compatible clients.
