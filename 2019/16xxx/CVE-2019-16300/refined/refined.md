  "cve": "CVE-2019-16300",
  "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
  "relevant_content": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing event handler in the vtn application, where it does not handle the HOST MOVED event type. This leads to potential issues with flow rule management.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing event handler for HOST MOVED event type in vtn application.",
          "Inconsistent handling of different event types related to host changes."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can cause denial of service due to flow rules not being reinstalled when a host moves. A malicious host can exploit this by causing inconsistencies in flow rule management, leading to potential disruptions in network operations.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious host can exploit the missing event handler by moving its network connection point.",
        "The attack is a cross-plane attack, utilizing crafted data plane input to influence control plane behavior."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a data plane host to send packets that can trigger a host movement event.",
        "additional_info": "The paper details how the event flow graph helps to identify these vulnerabilities, and how cross-plane attacks can be used to trigger such vulnerabilities that ultimately lead to data plane consequences. The vtn app installs flow rules for added hosts (HOST ADDED), removes flow rules for removed hosts (HOST REMOVED), and installs/removes flow rules for changed hosts (HOST UPDATED), but does not react to HOST MOVED event.
