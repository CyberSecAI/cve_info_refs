      "description": "Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to a symlink reference outside of node_modules. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of the node_modules folder through the bin field upon installation. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user’s system when the package is installed. Only files accessible by the user running the npm install are affected.",
      "root_cause": "A package's package.json file, when processed by the npm CLI, can create symlinks to files outside of the node_modules folder through the bin field.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The npm CLI does not properly sanitize the bin field in package.json.",
        "Allows for the creation of symlinks to arbitrary files."

        "A malicious actor publishes a package to a public or private registry, containing a crafted package.json file with a malicious bin field.",

      "description": "Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Write. It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to arbitrary files on a user’s system when the package is installed.  This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.",
       "root_cause": "The npm CLI does not properly validate entries in the package.json's 'bin' field, allowing access to locations outside the node_modules folder.",

      ],
      "impact": "A malicious actor can use a crafted package.json file to create or modify arbitrary files during package installation, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or disruption of service. This is limited to files the user performing the npm command has permission to create/write to.",

      "description": "Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a serve binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a serve binary would overwrite the previous serve binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.",
