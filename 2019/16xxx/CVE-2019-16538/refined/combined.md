## Introduction

The plugin provides the basic infrastructure for generating "bundles" of support information within Jenkins.

There are three ways of generating bundles:

* Automatic bundles, these get saved in $JENKINS\_HOME/support once per hour starting 3 minutes after Jenkins starts the plugin (i.e. this may still be generated even if Jenkins will not fully start). The automatic bundles are retained using an exponential aging strategy, so you should have a bunch of them over the entire lifetime once the plugin has been installed.
* On demand bundles:
  + You can generate them from the root "Support" action, using the User Interface ; or
  + By using the CLI Command. For the association documentation, please refer to `<yourJenkinsInstanceUrl>/cli/command/support` embedded documentation.

## Global Configuration

Features and functionalities of the Support Core plugin can be configured globally under **Manage Jenkins > Support Core**.

### Automated Support Bundle Generation

Configure the automated generation of the Support Bundle. By default, Support Core configures a periodic task that generates a support bundle every hour. This can tremendously help troubleshoot issues in Jenkins, in cases where data could not be collected at the time an issue happened or started to happen.

The following option apply:

* **Enable**: Whether to enable the automatic generation of the support bundle or not (default to true)
* **Period**: The recurrence period (in hours) to generate support bundle (default to 1h). Values between 1 and 24 are accepted.
* **Components**: The list of components to include in the automatic bundle (default to all components)

The system property `com.cloudbees.jenkins.support.SupportPlugin.AUTO_BUNDLE_PERIOD_HOURS` can be used to enforce the value of the period. Values between 0 and 24 are accepted. A value of `0` enforce the disablement of the automated support bundle generation.

## Docker File

As part of the support bundle if the About Jenkins option is checked then you will receive a docker file in the bundle also. The docker file contains the current version of Jenkins, along with a wget operation to download all of the plugins on the Jenkins controller. This creates a similar environment for testing or reproducing bugs.

First build the image:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile

```

then run the docker image

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80

```

This should create a new Jenkins controller with the same version, and the same plugins and versions all bundled.

## Frequent issues

### Support bundles corrupt through the UI

The most common situation for this to happen is when the **About Jenkins** option is enabled.

Meanwhile, the support bundle is getting generated it looks like the generation process is stuck as the downloaded size stays at the same point for a long time. To diagnosis this issue the best is to take a threadDump when in the moment where it is stuck and check the Jenkins logs.

If a stacktrace like the one below appears

```
"Handling POST /support/download from XX.XX.XX.XX : RequestHandlerThread[#126]" Id=123772 Group=main RUNNABLE
    at java.io.UnixFileSystem.getBooleanAttributes0(Native Method)
    at java.io.UnixFileSystem.getBooleanAttributes(UnixFileSystem.java:242)
    at java.io.File.isDirectory(File.java:849)

    at com.cloudbees.jenkins.support.api.PrintedContent.writeTo(PrintedContent.java:47)
    at com.cloudbees.jenkins.support.SupportPlugin.writeBundle(SupportPlugin.java:359)
    at com.cloudbees.jenkins.support.SupportAction.doDownload(SupportAction.java:154)

```

and the Jenkins logs are populated with

```
2018-01-04 04:52:17.633+0000 [id=123769] WARNING c.c.j.support.SupportPlugin#writeBundle: Could not attach 'nodes/slave/agent1/checksums.md5' to support bundle

    at com.cloudbees.jenkins.support.SupportPlugin.writeBundle(SupportPlugin.java:358)
    at com.cloudbees.jenkins.support.SupportAction.doDownload(SupportAction.java:154)

```

Then, surely the problem is that you are hitting the **Idle timeout** in the load balancer and this makes the connection betweek the ELB and your broweser to drop. To workaround this problem you can:

* Increase the Idle timeout in the load balancer
* Not include About Jenkins section
* Reduce the number of builds in the system

## Support Bundle Anonymization

[Beginning in version 2.48](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-21670), this plugin now allows for automated `ContentFilter` extensions to enable anonymizing of various data. By enabling this feature, the default set of filters will anonymize agent names, agent computer names, agent labels, view names (aka folders), job names, usernames, and IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). These data are mapped to randomly generated fake names which are saved to Jenkins controller. A Jenkins administrator can view these mappings by going to **Manage Jenkins** **â€º> Support Bundle Anonymization**. All files written to the support bundle by this and all extensions of this plugin will replace all instances of the original values with their anonymized counterpart. Note that the Stop Words list on that page shows which terms are ignored when filtering names (case-insensitive full match).

### Additional Stop Words

Additional Stop Words can be provided in a text file located at `$JENKINS_HOME/support/additional-stop-words.txt`. Each non-blank line of the file is treated as a stop word. The following contains 3 stop words `abc`, `john doe` and `https://test.example.com`

```
abc
john doe
https://test.example.com

```

The system property `com.cloudbees.jenkins.support.filter.ContentMappings.additionalStopWordsFile` can be used to override the file location.

### Limitations

Anonymization filters only apply to text files. It cannot handle non-Jenkins URLs, custom proprietary Jenkins plugin names, and exceptions quoting invalid Groovy code in a Jenkins pipeline. The active plugins, disabled plugins, failed plugins, and `Dockerfile` reports are not anonymized due to several Jenkins plugins and other Java libraries using version numbers that are indistinguishable from IP addresses. These reports are in the files `plugins/active.txt`, `plugins/disabled.txt`, `plugins/failed.txt`, and `docker/Dockerfile`. These files should all be manually reviewed if you do not wish to disclose the names of custom proprietary plugins.

## Configuration as Code

As of 2.68 version, support-core is compatible with [Jenkins Configuration as Code](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin) (CasC).

The configuration looks like:

```
security:
  anonymizeSupportBundle:
    enabled: true

```

It enables (*true*) or disables (*false*) the anonymization of the bundle.

Previous versions of this plugin could be configured by CasC as well, but the configuration was so:

```
unclassified:
  contentFilters:
    enabled: false

```

This version changes the configuration fields to be more intuitive. Please update your yaml file if you update support-core to version 2.68 or later.

## Support Bundle - Sensitive data auto redaction

Starting from version 2.72.2, Support Core plugin could automatically redact any passwords stored in the following files:

* `nodes.md`
* `about.md`
* `nodes/master/system.properties` for controllers and agents
* `nodes/master/environment.txt`
* `nodes/slave/name/proc/self/environ` and `nodes/slave/name/proc/self/cmdline` for Linux based instances
* `nodes/slave/name/config.xml` for each agent
* launch log files per each agent located in `nodes/slave/name/launchLogs`

To support this feature, a text file named `security-stop-words.txt` has been added to the `$JENKINS_HOME/support` folder. It contains security stop words that are used to detect passwords or secrets. When the bundle is generated, the word "REDACTED" replaces any values associated with these stop words.

For example, if one of the security stop words is "passwd", the following string:

```
-username.net.passwd=mySecret

```

will be changed to:

```
-username.net.passwd=REDACTED

```

To disable this feature, delete all of the security stop words from the security-stop-words.txt file (but not the file itself, because it will be automatically regenerated with a default values). Any changes made to the security-stop-words.txt file are applied after a Jenkins instance restart.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you havenâ€™t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

SECURITY-1658 / CVE-2019-16538
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
closure default parameter expressions.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1634 / CVE-2019-16539 (permission check), CVE-2019-16540 (path traversal)
Support Core Plugin did not validate the paths submitted for the "Delete
Support Bundles" feature. This allowed users to delete arbitrary files on
the Jenkins master file system accessible to the OS user account running
Jenkins.

Additionally, this endpoint did not perform a permission check, allowing
users with Overall/Read permission to delete support bundles, and any
arbitrary other file, with a known name/path.

SECURITY-1106 / CVE-2019-16541
JIRA Plugin allows the definition of per-folder Jira sites.

The credentials lookup for this feature did not set the appropriate
context, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved
for use in the global configuration. This allowed users with Item/Configure
permission on the folder to access credentials theyâ€™re not entitled to,
and potentially capture them.

SECURITY-1539 / CVE-2019-16542
Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored an Anchore.io service
password unencrypted in job config.xml files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1554 / CVE-2019-16543
Spira Importer Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global
configuration file com.inflectra.spiratest.plugins.SpiraBuilder.xml on the
Jenkins master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to
the master file system.

SECURITY-1584 / CVE-2019-16546
Google Compute Engine Plugin did not use SSH host key verification when
connecting to VMs launched by the plugin. This lack of verification could
be abused by a MitM attacker to intercept these connections to
attacker-specified build agents without warning.

SECURITY-1585 / CVE-2019-16547
Google Compute Engine Plugin did not verify permissions on multiple
auto-complete API endpoints. This allowed users with Overall/Read
permissions to view various metadata about the running cloud environment.

SECURITY-1586 / CVE-2019-16548
Google Compute Engine Plugin did not require POST requests on an API
endpoint. This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to provision new
agents.

SECURITY-727 (1) / CVE-2019-16544
QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in
job config.xml files on the Jenkins master as part of its post-build step
configuration. This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read
permission or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-727 (2) / CVE-2019-16545
QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stores a credential as part of
its post-build step configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since QMetry for JIRA -
Test Management Plugin 1.13, it is transmitted in plain text as part of
the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the password
through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and
similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1658
/
CVE-2019-16538**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through closure default parameter expressions.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Support Core Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to delete arbitrary files

**SECURITY-1634
/
CVE-2019-16539 (permission check), CVE-2019-16540 (path traversal)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`support-core`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/support-core)**

**Description:**

Support Core Plugin did not validate the paths submitted for the "Delete Support Bundles" feature.
This allowed users to delete arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system accessible to the OS user account running Jenkins.

Additionally, this endpoint did not perform a permission check, allowing users with Overall/Read permission to delete support bundles, and any arbitrary other file, with a known name/path.

Support Core Plugin now only allows the deletion of support bundles and related files listed on the UI through this feature.
It also ensures that only users with "Download Bundle" permission are able to delete support bundles.

### Folder-scoped Jira sites in Jira Plugin were able to access System-scoped credentials

**SECURITY-1106
/
CVE-2019-16541**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jira`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira)**

**Description:**

Jira Plugin allows the definition of per-folder Jira sites.

The credentials lookup for this feature did not set the appropriate context, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for use in the global configuration.
This allowed users with Item/Configure permission on the folder to access credentials theyâ€™re not entitled to, and potentially capture them.

Jira Plugin now defines the appropriate folder context for credential lookup.
As a side effect, existing per-folder Jira sites may lose access to already configured System-scoped credentials, as if no credential was specified in the first place.

### Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1539
/
CVE-2019-16542**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`anchore-container-scanner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/anchore-container-scanner)**

**Description:**

Anchore Container Image Scanner Plugin stored an Anchore.io service password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As the affected functionality has been deprecated, and the affected Anchore.io service has been shut down in late 2018, the affected feature has been removed.
The password will be removed from the job configuration once it is saved again.

### Spira Importer Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1554
/
CVE-2019-16543**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`inflectra-spira-integration`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/inflectra-spira-integration)**

**Description:**

Spira Importer Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.inflectra.spiratest.plugins.SpiraBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
This credential could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Spira Importer Plugin now stores this credential encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

### Google Compute Engine Plugin did not verify SSH host keys

**SECURITY-1584
/
CVE-2019-16546**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin did not use SSH host key verification when connecting to VMs launched by the plugin.
This lack of verification could be abused by a MitM attacker to intercept these connections to attacker-specified build agents without warning.

Google Compute Engine Plugin now verifies SSH host keys before executing any commands on agents.

### Google Compute Engine Plugin disclosed environment information to users with Overall/Read permission

**SECURITY-1585
/
CVE-2019-16547**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin did not verify permissions on multiple auto-complete API endpoints.
This allowed users with Overall/Read permissions to view various metadata about the running cloud environment.

Google Compute Engine Plugin now requires the appropriate Job/Configure permission to view these metadata.

### CSRF vulnerability in Google Compute Engine Plugin allowed provisioning agents

**SECURITY-1586
/
CVE-2019-16548**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin did not require POST requests on an API endpoint.
This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to provision new agents.

Google Compute Engine Plugin now requires POST requests for this API endpoint.

### QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-727 (1)
/
CVE-2019-16544**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`qmetry-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/qmetry-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its post-build step configuration.
This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted once the job configuration is saved again.

### QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin shows plain text password in configuration form

**SECURITY-727 (2)
/
CVE-2019-16545**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`qmetry-for-jira-test-management`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/qmetry-for-jira-test-management)**

**Description:**

QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin stores a credential as part of its post-build step configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk since QMetry for JIRA - Test Management Plugin 1.13, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
