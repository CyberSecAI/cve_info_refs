### Summary:
The Support Core Plugin in Jenkins versions 2.63 and earlier is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to a missing path validation and permission check in the "Delete Support Bundles" feature. This allows users with Overall/Read permissions to delete arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller's file system, accessible to the OS user account running Jenkins.

### Details:
- **Vulnerability:** Missing path validation and permission check.
- **Root cause:** The Support Core Plugin does not validate the paths submitted for the "Delete Support Bundles" feature and lacks a permission check.
- **Attack vector:** A user with Overall/Read permission can access the "Delete Support Bundles" feature and specify a path to an arbitrary file on the Jenkins controller.
- **Affected versions:** Support Core Plugin up to and including 2.63.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary file deletion on the Jenkins controller, potentially leading to denial of service or other security impacts.
- **Required capabilities:** Overall/Read permission.
- **Mitigation:** Update Support Core Plugin to version 2.64 or later. This version includes fixes to validate paths and ensure that only users with "Download Bundle" permission are able to delete support bundles.
