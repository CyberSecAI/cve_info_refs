```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `RwLock` implementation used `Ordering::Relaxed` in the `Drop` implementation of `RwLockWriteGuard`, allowing the compiler or CPU to reorder a mutable access on the locked data after the lock has been yielded.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory ordering in the `Drop` implementation of `RwLockWriteGuard`, leading to potential data races.",
      "Buggy lock acquisition failure in `RwLock::try_read` where a different thread could increment the readers count, making the CAS check incorrect."
    ],
    "impact": "The incorrect memory ordering could lead to two writers acquiring the lock simultaneously, resulting in memory corruption and undefined behavior. On weakly ordered architectures like ARM, this is more likely to result in memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by using the flawed `RwLock` implementation in a multi-threaded environment.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute code that utilizes the vulnerable `RwLock` implementation in a multi-threaded application."
