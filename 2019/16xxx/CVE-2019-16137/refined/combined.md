## Description

Wrong memory orderings inside the RwLock implementation allow for two writers to acquire the lock at the same time. The drop implementation used Ordering::Relaxed, which allows the compiler or CPU to reorder a mutable access on the locked data after the lock has been yielded.

Only users of the RwLock implementation are affected. Users of Once (including users of lazy\_static with the spin\_no\_std feature enabled) are NOT affected.

On strongly ordered CPU architectures like x86, the only real way that this would lead to a memory corruption is if the compiler reorders an access after the lock is yielded, which is possible but in practice unlikely. It is a more serious issue on weakly ordered architectures such as ARM which, except in the presence of certain instructions, allow the hardware to decide which accesses are seen at what times. Therefore on an ARM system it is likely that using the wrong memory ordering would result in a memory corruption, even if the compiler itself doesn't reorder the memory accesses in a buggy way.

More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

# Wrong atomic ordering in `Drop` impl for `RwLockWriteGuard` and buggy lock acquisition failure in `RwLock::try_read` #65

## Description

![@64](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154626?u=c4752cfd286ba9702aca5c0fc08d8c2170c5cf5f&v=4&size=48)[64](https://github.com/64)opened [on Jun 27, 2019](https://github.com/mvdnes/spin-rs/issues/65#issue-461668060)

Multiple issues in the `RwLock` implementation.

The first (and the worst) one is here:

```
impl<'rwlock, T: ?Sized> Drop for RwLockWriteGuard<'rwlock, T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.lock.store(0, Ordering::Relaxed);
    }
}
```

Use of `Ordering::Relaxed` is incorrect. The compiler is free to reorder a write behind this, which could lead to two mutable refs being used at the same time (UB). It should be `Ordering::Release` instead (maybe this was just a typo?). Other parts of this code use the needlessly strict `SeqCst` ordering, but that's not a soundness issue.

The second that I've found is a bug in the `try_read` function:

```
    pub fn try_read(&self) -> Option<RwLockReadGuard<T>>
    {
        let old = (!USIZE_MSB) & self.lock.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
		// readers variable could be incremented here
        let new = old + 1;
        if self.lock.compare_and_swap(old,
                                      new,
                                      Ordering::SeqCst) == old
        {
            Some(RwLockReadGuard {
                lock: &self.lock,
                data: unsafe { & *self.data.get() },
            })
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
```

The problem is that a different thread could increment the readers count on the indicated line, making the value that the CAS checks for incorrect - it might fail even if there are no writers at all. For example:

```
    let lock = Arc::new(spin::RwLock::new(0));

    {
        let lock = lock.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            loop {
                lock.try_read().unwrap();
            }
        });
    }

    thread::spawn(move || {
        loop {
            // Increment and decrement readers count in a loop
            lock.read();
        }
    }).join();
```

This code panics for me, even though it there are no writers so `try_read` should always succeed.

To be frank, I think it would be better to simply rewrite this whole implementation. The original blog that this was implemented from uses the writers bit to allow for recursive write locking (which this crate doesn't) - I see no reason not to just use some sentinel value like -1 to indicate a writer is holding the lock.
