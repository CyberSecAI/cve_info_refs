Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16989:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The file `app/conferences_active/conference_interactive.php` in FusionPBX up to version 4.5.7 uses an unsanitized "c" variable from the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The unsanitized "c" variable is reflected in the HTML output, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated user's session by tricking them into clicking a malicious link. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Phishing attacks by injecting fake forms or popups
    - Stealing of sensitive user data

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the "c" parameter, which is then reflected in the HTML of the `conference_interactive.php` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to click a specially crafted URL. This typically involves social engineering techniques such as sending the malicious link via email or chat. The attacker does not need prior access to the application other than the ability to send links to logged in users of the FusionPBX instance.
