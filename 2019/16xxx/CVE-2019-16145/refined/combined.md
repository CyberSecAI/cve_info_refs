### **[rschultheis](/rschultheis)** commented [Sep 13, 2019](#issuecomment-531262846)

| 👋 I've noticed this issue was assigned <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16145>  It also looks to me at this time no release has been made to rubygems? [The latest release on rubygems is 0.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/padrino-contrib).  Are there are any plans to release this fix to rubygems in a new version?  And thanks for your work on Padrino-contrib! |
