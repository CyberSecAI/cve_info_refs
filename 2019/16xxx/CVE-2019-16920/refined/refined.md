Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-16920

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ping_ipaddr` parameter within the `/apply_sec.cgi` script, which is accessible without authentication. Specifically, the application fails to properly handle newline characters within this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Unauthenticated Access:** The `/apply_sec.cgi` script is accessible without any authentication, allowing unauthenticated users to interact with it.
2.  **Command Injection:**  The `ping_test` action, reachable through `/apply_sec.cgi`, takes the `ping_ipaddr` parameter and uses it in a system call to ping.  By injecting newline characters (%0a) into the `ping_ipaddr` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the ping command executed on the system.
3.  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `ping_ipaddr` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of newline characters and subsequent command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected D-Link router. This can lead to:
*   Complete compromise of the device.
*   Installation of backdoors.
*   Retrieval of sensitive information, like admin passwords.
*   Denial of service through malicious command execution

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/apply_sec.cgi` endpoint with the `action=ping_test` and a malicious payload within the `ping_ipaddr` parameter. The payload contains a newline character (%0a) followed by the desired system command to be executed.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by simply viewing a specially-crafted web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable D-Link router. No prior authentication is required.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.

**Affected Devices:**
The vulnerability affects several D-Link router models including:
*   DIR-655
*   DIR-866L
*   DIR-652
*   DHP-1565
*   DIR-855L
*   DAP-1533
*   DIR-862L
*   DIR-615
*   DIR-835
*   DIR-825

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs.
*   The affected D-Link products are at their End of Life (EOL), meaning D-Link will not provide updates to fix the issue.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is available which can disable network connectivity on vulnerable devices.
*   The `apply_sec.cgi` script executes actions based on an array called `SSC_SEC_OBJS`. The `ping_test` action within this array is vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on October 3, 2019.

This vulnerability is critical due to the ease of exploitation and the high level of access gained.
