Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-16255:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of untrusted data passed to the first argument (command argument) of the `Shell#[]` and `Shell#test` methods within the Ruby standard library (lib/shell.rb).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Code Injection:** The core weakness is the possibility of injecting arbitrary code. By providing specially crafted input to `Shell#[]` and `Shell#test`, an attacker can force the execution of arbitrary Ruby methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Ruby code.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `Shell#[]` and `Shell#test` methods. These methods, which are intended for file testing, can be abused when provided with untrusted command inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Untrusted Data Injection:** Attackers need to be able to supply untrusted data to the affected methods, which are `Shell#[]` and `Shell#test`, as their first argument. 
*  **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability exists because the Ruby `Shell#[]` and `Shell#test` methods, meant for file testing, don't properly sanitize the command input. An attacker can inject code within this input and execute it by exploiting how these methods process and evaluate command strings.

**Affected Versions:**
* All releases of Ruby 2.3 and earlier.
* Ruby 2.4 series: Ruby 2.4.7 and earlier.
* Ruby 2.5 series: Ruby 2.5.6 and earlier.
* Ruby 2.6 series: Ruby 2.6.4 and earlier.
* Ruby 2.7.0-preview1.

**Additional Information:**
*   Some documents mention that this is a code injection vulnerability in the standard library (lib/shell.rb).
*   The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary ruby method execution.
*   The maintainers highlight the danger of passing untrusted data to Shell methods and, although it's generally dangerous to do so, this case is treated as a vulnerability due to the assumed purpose of these specific methods.
* The fix is to upgrade to a version of ruby that has the flaw corrected, such as 2.4.8, 2.5.7 or 2.6.5.
