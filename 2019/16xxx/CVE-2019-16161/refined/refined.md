Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2019-16161.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `onig_error_code_to_str()` function, which attempts to use members of the `einfo.enc` structure after a failure in `onig_new()`. When `onig_new()` fails, specifically with the error code `-215` (ONIGERR_INVALID_GROUP_NAME), the `einfo.enc` pointer becomes invalid, leading to a memory corruption when `onig_error_code_to_str()` tries to access members of this structure. Specifically, the `mbc_to_code` member is accessed, which is a null pointer, resulting in a crash due to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free or invalid pointer dereference: The `einfo.enc` pointer becomes invalid when `onig_new()` fails and `onig_error_code_to_str()` attempts to access its members, leading to a crash.
- Lack of proper error handling: The error handling in `onig_error_code_to_str()` does not check for the validity of `einfo.enc` before accessing its members.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: The primary impact is a segmentation fault due to a null pointer dereference within the `to_ascii` function, which is called by `onig_error_code_to_str`.
- Denial of service: The crash can lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting a specific regular expression that causes `onig_new()` to fail with error code `-215` (ONIGERR_INVALID_GROUP_NAME). Specifically, a regex like `(?0d` triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the regular expression string passed to the `onig_new()` function.
