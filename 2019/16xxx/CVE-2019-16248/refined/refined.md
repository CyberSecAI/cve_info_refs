Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the Telegram app's failure to delete media files from the recipient's local storage when using the "Also delete for [recipient]" feature or "delete for all members" in groups.  The feature only removes the media from the chat window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Privacy Violation:** The primary vulnerability is a privacy issue. Users believe that deleting a message also removes the media file from the recipient's device, but this is not the case.
-   **Data Persistence:**  Deleted media files remain in the recipient's internal storage at `/Telegram/Telegram Images/` even after the deletion action is performed.
-  **Inconsistent Behavior:** Telegram’s delete functionality does not match the behavior of other similar apps, such as WhatsApp, which deletes the media files from the recipient's storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Data Exposure:** Confidential photos or media shared by a user can still be accessed by the recipient, even after the sender deletes them using the provided functionality.
-   **Privacy Breach:** This can lead to unintentional privacy breaches if sensitive media is shared and believed to be deleted.
-   **Loss of Trust:** Users' trust in Telegram's privacy measures is undermined.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The vulnerability is triggered by sending media content (specifically images) and then using the "delete for [recipient]" feature within the Telegram app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The "attacker" is essentially any Telegram user who sends media files and then deletes them with the expectation that the media will also be removed from the recipient's device.
-   The sender needs to have a media file to share and have the desire to delete it later using the intended feature of Telegram.
- The recipient has the capability of accessing the local storage of their device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects the Telegram app for Android, version 5.10.0 (1684). It's speculated that the issue also exists in Telegram for iOS and Windows.
-   A fix was implemented in Telegram version 5.11.
- The vulnerability was also compared to WhatsApp's implementation of the same delete functionality, which correctly removes media files from the recipient's storage.
- The issue was reported to the Telegram security team via `security[at]telegram[dot]org`.
- The reporter was awarded €2,500 by Telegram.
