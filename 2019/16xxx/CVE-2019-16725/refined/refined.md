- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate escaping of the logo parameter in the default templates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts through the logo parameter, potentially leading to various impacts such as stealing user session cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the logo parameter of default templates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to modify the logo parameter of the affected Joomla! templates, likely through the administrator interface, depending on the specific access control and implementation of template settings.
