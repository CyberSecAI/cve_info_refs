Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16118:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes code changesets for the "Photo Gallery by 10Web" WordPress plugin, specifically focusing on `bwg.js` and `Options.php`. These changesets address a vulnerability related to improper sanitization of user input used in watermark text. This aligns with the nature of vulnerabilities mentioned in the CVE. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied text used in the watermark functionality of the Photo Gallery plugin. Specifically, the plugin was not escaping the watermark text before using it in the `preview_built_in_watermark` function within `bwg.js`. Additionally, the input from the `built_in_watermark_text` field was not being sanitized on the server-side before being used in the application.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within the watermark text field. Because this input wasn't being sanitized, the injected script would be executed when a user previewed the watermark.
    *   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The plugin was missing proper sanitization and escaping of the user-supplied watermark text on both the client-side (within `bwg.js`) and server-side (within `Options.php`). This allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities:
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
        *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        *   **Defacement:** Modifying website content.
        *   **Malware Distribution:** Injecting scripts to distribute malware.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript into the `built_in_watermark_text` input field.
    *   The malicious code is executed when a user previews the watermark within the Photo Gallery settings.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to have access to the WordPress admin panel with the ability to modify the Photo Gallery plugin settings.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to modify the built-in watermark text field.

**3. Technical Details from the provided diffs:**

*   **`photo-gallery/trunk/js/bwg.js`:**
    *   The original code directly used the value from the `built_in_watermark_text` field without any escaping:
       ```javascript
          watermark_text = ~~document.getElementById('built\_in\_watermark\_text').value~~;
       ```
    *   The fix implements a new `tw_escape()` function to properly escape the user-supplied watermark text:
       ```javascript
          function tw_escape(string) {
            var htmlEscapes = {
              '&': '&amp;',
              '<': '&lt;',
              '>': '&gt;',
              '"': '&quot;',
              "'": '&#x27;',
              '/': '&#x2F;'
            };
            var htmlEscaper = /[&<>"'\/]/g;
          
            return ('' + string).replace(htmlEscaper, function(match) {
              return htmlEscapes[match];
            });
          };

         watermark_text = tw_escape(document.getElementById('built_in_watermark_text').value);
       ```
*   **`photo-gallery/trunk/admin/controllers/Options.php`:**
    *   The original code directly used the value from the `built_in_watermark_text` field:
       ```php
          $update_options['built_in_watermark_text'] = WDWLibrary::get('built_in_watermark_text');
       ```
    *   The fix sanitizes the input value from the `built_in_watermark_text` field using `sanitize_text_field`:
       ```php
          $update_options['built_in_watermark_text'] = WDWLibrary::get('built_in_watermark_text', '', 'sanitize_text_field');
       ```
    *   The code was also updated to exclude files containing "twbb" from the list of watermark fonts.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The changelog for the plugin indicates multiple security fixes in versions prior to 1.8.31, highlighting an ongoing effort to address vulnerabilities.
*   The plugin has a large user base (200,000+ active installations), making this type of vulnerability a significant risk.

In summary, CVE-2019-16118 is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Photo Gallery plugin caused by improper sanitization of the watermark text. This could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts and compromise WordPress sites. The fix involves both client-side escaping and server-side sanitization of user-supplied input.
