Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16571:

**CVE-2019-16571:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** RapidDeploy Plugin for Jenkins, versions 4.1 and earlier.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not perform a permission check on form validation methods.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission check:**  Form validation methods lack proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to trigger them.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** These form validation methods do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read access can cause Jenkins to connect to arbitrary URLs on an attacker-specified server. This can be used for server-side request forgery attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can leverage the lack of permission checks on form validation methods.
    *   CSRF can be exploited to trigger these methods on behalf of a victim.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious requests to the Jenkins server, potentially via a victim's browser.

**Summary**

The RapidDeploy Plugin allows users with Overall/Read permissions to connect to attacker-controlled servers due to a lack of permission checks and CSRF protection in its form validation methods. This vulnerability enables server-side request forgery attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory states that as of the publication date, no fix is available for this vulnerability.
*   The advisory provides a CVSS score of Medium, indicating moderate severity.
