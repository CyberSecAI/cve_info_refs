    "summary": "The provided content describes CVE-2019-16202, a vulnerability in MISP (versions <= 2.4.114) related to improper access control on the REST API, allowing pivoting to other MISP instances. It also details the fix in version 2.4.115.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability was caused by a flawed decision to allow sync users and org admins to access the server index, along with inconsistent handling of the query in the API and UI, and the inclusion of API keys in the output.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Inconsistent handling of queries in API and UI",
        "Exposure of API keys to non-admin users"
      ],
      "impact": "Authenticated sync and org admin users can access all configured synchronisation servers, including API keys, allowing them to pivot to other MISP instances and authenticate using the acquired keys.",
       "attack_vectors": "By requesting the `/servers/index` endpoint via the API, authenticated sync and org admin users gain access to sensitive information and the potential to move to other instances",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated sync or org admin user of a vulnerable MISP instance."
    },
     "additional_information": "The content provides details on the vulnerability's timeline, mitigation, fix, and the process of resetting potentially exposed keys. It also includes a breakdown of the code changes made to address the vulnerability, specifically in `ACLComponent.php`, `ServersController.php`, and `UsersController.php`, which were modified to restrict access to the `/servers/index` endpoint to site administrators and to log unauthorized attempts."
