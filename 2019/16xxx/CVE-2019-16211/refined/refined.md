- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Database credentials are stored in plaintext in a configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Plaintext Password Storage
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated malicious user with access to the configuration file may obtain the exposed password to gain access to the application database. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulation of the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Access to the configuration file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the configuration file where the database credentials are stored. This could be achieved through local file access or via a compromised server.
