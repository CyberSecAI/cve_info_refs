  "CVE-2019-16327": {
    "Description": "The D-Link DIR 601 router with firmware version 2.00NA is vulnerable to an authentication bypass. The router relies on client-side protection for authentication and does not validate on the server side, allowing users to perform any operation without authentication.",
    "Root cause": "The router does not validate authentication on the server side, relying solely on client-side checks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing server-side authentication enforcement"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can perform any router operation without authentication.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to the router's web interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have a way to access the router's web interface, no authentication is required"
  }
