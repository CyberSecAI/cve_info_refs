Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-16551:

**CVE-2019-16551: CSRF vulnerability in Gerrit Trigger Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Gerrit Trigger Plugin's form validation methods lack both proper permission checks and CSRF protection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin does not verify if the user performing form validation has the necessary permissions, allowing users with `Overall/Read` access to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation methods do not require POST requests, making them susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with `Overall/Read` permissions can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
        *   Perform connection tests to arbitrary HTTP or SSH servers using attacker-specified credentials.
        *   Determine if files with attacker-specified paths exist on the Jenkins master file system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious web page or link that, when accessed by an authenticated Jenkins user, will trigger the vulnerable form validation methods.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to entice a Jenkins user with at least Overall/Read access to click a link or visit a malicious page and must know the structure of the vulnerable form validation method.

**Additional Details:**

*   The identified vulnerabilities affect Gerrit Trigger Plugin versions 2.30.1 and earlier.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.30.2, which now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.
