- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference occurs in the `huffman_decode_step` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code doesn't properly handle cases where the `phc` pointer is null, leading to a null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV), causing the program to crash. This can result in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted JPEG file (`POC` file in the description) as input to the `ffjpeg` program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable application (i.e., a malicious crafted JPEG file).
