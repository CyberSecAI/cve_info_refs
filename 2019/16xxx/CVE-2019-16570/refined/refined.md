Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16570:

**CVE-2019-16570**

*   **Root Cause:** The RapidDeploy Plugin does not perform permission checks on form validation methods and does not require POST requests for these methods.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Form validation methods lack proper authorization, allowing users with Overall/Read access to perform actions they shouldn't.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** Form validation methods do not require POST requests, leading to a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can leverage the CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check to make Jenkins connect to RapidDeploy-related paths on an attacker-specified server. This results in Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted requests to the Jenkins server.
    *   **User Interaction:** The CSRF vulnerability relies on a victim's browser sending a crafted request, possibly through social engineering or a malicious webpage.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
    *   The attacker can be an authenticated user on the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious request that exploits the form validation methods within the RapidDeploy plugin, often embedded in a malicious web page.
