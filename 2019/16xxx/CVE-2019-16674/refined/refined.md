**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable from Observable State (CWE-341):** The authentication mechanism relies on a cookie with predictable data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of the administrator password.
*   Gaining unauthorized access to the device.
*   Potential impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker must be able to capture network traffic to intercept the vulnerable cookie.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path to intercept traffic.
*   No specific user interaction or privileges are required to intercept and exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Weidmueller Industrial Ethernet managed switches, specifically within the  IE-SW-VL05M, IE-SW-VL08MT, and IE-SW-PL series.
*   The vendor has released patched firmware to address this and other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-16670, CVE-2019-16671, CVE-2019-16672, CVE-2019-16673).
*   The unencrypted search service should be disabled after the patch to avoid the vulnerabilities.
