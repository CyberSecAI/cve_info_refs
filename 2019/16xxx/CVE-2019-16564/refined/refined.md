Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16564:

**CVE-2019-16564: Stored XSS vulnerability in Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin does not properly escape user-controlled information, specifically stage names or job names, before displaying it in its view.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper output escaping, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected and stored within the displayed information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through job configurations or pipeline stage definitions. When other users view the aggregated pipeline information, this injected script would execute in their browsers. This could allow the attacker to:
    *   Steal session cookies.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Potentially escalate privileges depending on the user's permissions.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  Malicious users with the ability to configure jobs, define pipeline stages, or influence the information displayed by the plugin can inject malicious code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to configure jobs, define pipeline stages, or have some way of influencing the information that is displayed by the Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin. This generally means a user with at least some level of access to configure Jenkins jobs.
*   **Affected Plugin:** Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin versions 1.8 and earlier are affected.
*   **Fix:** Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin version 1.9 addresses the issue by properly escaping user-controlled information.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious script is stored and then executed when another user accesses the view. The attacker needs the capability to configure jobs or influence what is displayed by the plugin. The impact is that when a victim views the page, the malicious code is executed and can perform several actions based on the attacker's malicious code.
