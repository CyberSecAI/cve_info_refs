The provided content relates to CVE-2019-16348.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the `gain_file()` function at `wav_gain.c:33`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code attempts to dereference a pointer that is NULL, leading to a segmentation fault (SEGV). This indicates a lack of proper null-pointer checks before accessing the memory location the pointer is supposed to point to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The application crashes due to the segmentation fault, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `wav_gain` utility is executed with a crafted input file (`$POC`) and a dummy output file (`/dev/null`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `wav_gain` utility and provide a specially crafted input file. The attacker needs to have access to the binary and the ability to execute it.
