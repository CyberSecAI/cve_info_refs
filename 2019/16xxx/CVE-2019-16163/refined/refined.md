Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-16163:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack exhaustion
*   **Root Cause:** Excessive recursion in `regparse.c` during regular expression compilation (`regcomp.c`). Specifically, parsing functions like `optimize_nodes()` and `tree_min_len()` make recursive calls.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted regular expression with deeply nested nodes.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). A specially crafted regular expression can cause a stack buffer overflow due to deep recursive calls, leading to a segmentation fault and program termination.
*   **Affected component:** Oniguruma regular expressions library. This library is notably used in PHP mbstring.
*   **Affected Systems:** Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu.
*   **Mitigation:** Apply patches provided by Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu. The patch involves limiting the parse depth to prevent excessive recursion.

The Github issue #147 provides a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability. The PoC constructs a large regular expression "X+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ .... " that triggers the stack exhaustion.
The fix is to limit recursion depth by incrementing a parse depth counter in `regparse.c` and checking if it exceeds a defined limit (`ParseDepthLimit`).
The Fedora update notification confirms that the fix for CVE-2019-16163 has been applied and backported to older versions.
