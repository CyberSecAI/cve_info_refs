- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of CSRF protection in Sentrifugo 3.2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick an administrator into executing arbitrary code by submitting a crafted HTML page.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted HTML page that includes a malicious form is used to trigger unintended actions on the application when an authenticated user (e.g., administrator) visits the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious HTML page, and the victim (administrator) needs to be authenticated to the Sentrifugo application and tricked into visiting that page.
