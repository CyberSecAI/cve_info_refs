Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `Special:Redirect` functionality in MediaWiki did not properly check the suppressed status of a target user ID before redirecting. This allowed a user to potentially access the user page of a suppressed user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The vulnerability allowed an attacker to discover usernames of suppressed users by using the `Special:Redirect` feature with numerical user IDs. The attacker can potentially reveal a suppressed user's existence by incrementally testing user IDs.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The `Special:Redirect` functionality lacked a check to prevent redirection to suppressed user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of suppressed usernames:** Attackers could bypass the suppression of usernames, which is intended to hide the user's identity from the public. This information could potentially be used to target or harass those users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could access the `Special:Redirect` page and increment user IDs until they find a suppressed user, thereby revealing the username.
- An attacker can craft a direct link to a suppressed user's page using the user ID through `[[Special:Redirect/user/SUPPRESSED_USER_ID]]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or knowledge of the username.
- The attacker only needs a basic understanding of MediaWiki's `Special:Redirect` functionality.
- The attacker only needs access to the affected MediaWiki instance.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding a permission check to `Special:Redirect` to ensure that redirects to suppressed user accounts are blocked.
- The fix is implemented by backporting a security fix rather than upgrading to a new version of MediaWiki.
- The vulnerability exists in older versions of MediaWiki.
- The provided content shows that patches have been made available for versions 1.27.7, 1.31.4, and also mentioned that it has been deployed to the master branch.
- The fix was deployed and made public after it was addressed and included in a security release.
- The "hideuser" permission is required to suppress a user.
