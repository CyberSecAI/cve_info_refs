## Description

Zulip server before 2.0.5 incompletely validated the MIME types of uploaded files. A user who is logged into the server could upload files of certain types to mount a stored cross-site scripting attack on other logged-in users. On a Zulip server using the default local uploads backend, the attack is only effective against browsers lacking support for Content-Security-Policy such as Internet Explorer 11. On a Zulip server using the S3 uploads backend, the attack is confined to the origin of the configured S3 uploads hostname and cannot reach the Zulip server itself.

# Zulip Server 2.0.5 security release

  [![](/_astro/tabbott.Y0j5haym_Z1qaMxj.webp)](author/tabbott/)  [Tim Abbott](author/tabbott/)   Sep 11, 2019 • 2 min read

We released Zulip Server 2.0.5 today. This is a security release, containing a
handful of cherry-picked changes since Zulip 2.0.4.

## What’s new

This releases fixes a few important bugs in previous versions of Zulip. It
contains fixes for the following security issues:

* CVE-2019-16215: Fix DoS vulnerability in Markdown LINK\_RE.
* CVE-2019-16216: Fix MIME type validation bug allowing XSS.

CVE-2019-16215 affects all past version of Zulip. CVE-2019-16216 affects common
configurations of Zulip 1.8.0 and newer.

This release also contains some bug fixes for new installations:

* Fixed email gateway postfix configuration for Ubuntu Bionic.
* Fixed support for hidden\_by\_limit messages in Slack import.
* Fixed confusing output from the `knight` management command.

We expect Zulip 2.1 to be released in the coming weeks, with hundreds of new
features and other changes.

## Upgrading

All users should upgrade promptly to secure their installations. See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html#upgrading)
in the Zulip documentation.

If you’re upgrading from 2.0.x, then the code changes are small and there are no
migrations or dependency changes, so the risk of unexpected disruption is low.
If you’re upgrading from an older version, we recommend upgrading directly to
2.0.5.

If you’re running a fork of master, you will need to
[rebase your fork](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/modifying-zulip.html#upgrading-to-future-releases)
to get these fixes.

If you need help, best-effort support is available on
[chat.zulip.org, the Zulip community chat server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html).

[CVE-2019-16216](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j2r8-2vxg-pxvh "CVE-2019-16216"): Fix MIME type validation.

```
* Whitelist a small number of image/ types to be served as
  non-attachments.
* Serve the file using the type that we validated rather than relying
  on an independent guess to match.

This issue can lead to a stored XSS security vulnerability for older
browsers that don't support Content-Security-Policy.

It primarily affects servers using Zulip's local file uploads backend
for servers running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial or newer; the legacy local
file upload backend for (now EOL) Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty was not affected
and it has limited impact for the S3 upload backend (which uses an
unprivileged S3 bucket domain to serve files).

This was fixed in master via [780ecb6](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/780ecb672b9324ba879056240089e14539cda6e4).
