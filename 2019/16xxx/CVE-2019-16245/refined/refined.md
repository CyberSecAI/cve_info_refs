- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OMERO server makes the details of each user (Experimenter instance fields) available to all other users. This is inconsistent with the principles of good data privacy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User information disclosure due to lack of proper access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of user details to other users within the OMERO system. This is considered a medium severity vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the OMERO server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Any user authenticated to the OMERO system can access the information of other users.
