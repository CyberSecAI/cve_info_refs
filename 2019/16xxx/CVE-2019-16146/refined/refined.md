- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The user name field in the User Management page was vulnerable to XSS because it was not properly sanitized before being rendered in the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, specifically a stored XSS. The user name field was not properly escaped.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could embed malicious JavaScript code in a user's name. When an admin views the User Management page, this code would execute in the admin's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to create a user with a malicious payload in the user name field, which will be executed when an admin visits the User Management page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an admin in order to create new users.
