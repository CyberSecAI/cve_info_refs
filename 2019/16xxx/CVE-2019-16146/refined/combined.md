If the user name is embedding some JS code, it will be executed on the client side. Note: gophish/static/js/dist/app/users.min.js will need to be regenerated too.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| LGTM - thanks! I don't know why I presumed that template literals would escape the variable contents. Great catch!  Just to make sure I'm not missing anything here, this seems like a self-stored XSS, in that only admins can create users, and only admins can view this user management page, right? |

| From my test I would say 'yes' only the user management page is affected. When authenticated as a malicious user name, the Account Settings page is not triggering the XSS. |
