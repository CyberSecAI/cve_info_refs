[CVE-2019-16215](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mmx6-xv2h-w7x8 "CVE-2019-16215"): Fix DoS vulnerability in Markdown LINK\_RE.

```
Any regex including a match-everything subpattern (.*, .*?, .+, or
.+?) is almost automatically wrong because it fails to disambiguate
when one subpattern should end and another should begin.  Among other
bugs, these kind of regexes tend to be especially prone to denial of
service vulnerabilities through catastrophic backtracking on strings
that fail to match in a large (in this case, exponential) number of
ways.

Lacking a specification to say what characters should actually be
allowed in these subpatterns (this syntax is too different from
CommonMark to be able to precisely apply those rules), I’ve tried to
make reasonable guesses and avoid changing much else.

Because Zulip doesn't store messages until they have successfully been
processed by the Markdown processor, this is not a stored DoS issue.

In general, Zulip protects against the broad category of DoS issues in
Markdown rendering via a timeout managed by another thread.  However,
details of Python's regular expression implementation mean that this
particular issue could prevent the timeout thread from being
scheduled, resulting in this being a DoS issue.

This was fixed in master a few months ago as a side effect of
[abe2dab](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/abe2dab88ca96786bb32dea6caab873819b8c482) ([#12979](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/12979)).

## Description

The Markdown parser in Zulip server before 2.0.5 used a regular expression vulnerable to exponential backtracking. A user who is logged into the server could send a crafted message causing the server to spend an effectively arbitrary amount of CPU time and stall the processing of future messages.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Zulip Server 2.0.5 security release

  [![](/_astro/tabbott.Y0j5haym_Z1qaMxj.webp)](author/tabbott/)  [Tim Abbott](author/tabbott/)   Sep 11, 2019 • 2 min read

We released Zulip Server 2.0.5 today. This is a security release, containing a
handful of cherry-picked changes since Zulip 2.0.4.

## What’s new

This releases fixes a few important bugs in previous versions of Zulip. It
contains fixes for the following security issues:

* CVE-2019-16215: Fix DoS vulnerability in Markdown LINK\_RE.
* CVE-2019-16216: Fix MIME type validation bug allowing XSS.

CVE-2019-16215 affects all past version of Zulip. CVE-2019-16216 affects common
configurations of Zulip 1.8.0 and newer.

This release also contains some bug fixes for new installations:

* Fixed email gateway postfix configuration for Ubuntu Bionic.
* Fixed support for hidden\_by\_limit messages in Slack import.
* Fixed confusing output from the `knight` management command.

We expect Zulip 2.1 to be released in the coming weeks, with hundreds of new
features and other changes.

## Upgrading

All users should upgrade promptly to secure their installations. See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html#upgrading)
in the Zulip documentation.

If you’re upgrading from 2.0.x, then the code changes are small and there are no
migrations or dependency changes, so the risk of unexpected disruption is low.
If you’re upgrading from an older version, we recommend upgrading directly to
2.0.5.

If you’re running a fork of master, you will need to
[rebase your fork](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/modifying-zulip.html#upgrading-to-future-releases)
to get these fixes.

If you need help, best-effort support is available on
[chat.zulip.org, the Zulip community chat server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html).
