Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `String.to_atom/1` in the `PowAssent` library. This function converts a string to an atom, which are not garbage-collected in Erlang. The vulnerable code fetched a value from user-provided parameters (specifically the "provider" parameter) and directly converted it to an atom.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Atom Creation:** Using `String.to_atom/1` with user-provided data allows an attacker to create an arbitrary number of atoms.
*   **Atom Table Exhaustion:**  Erlang has a limit on the number of atoms that can exist (~1 million by default). By sending requests with varying provider names, an attacker can force the server to create new atoms until the atom table is exhausted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exhausting the atom table causes the Erlang VM to crash, leading to a denial of service. The application using this library becomes unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests that include unique or randomly generated strings in the `provider` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application using the `PowAssent` library.
*   No authentication is required. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability without any special privileges or prior access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in `PowAssent.Phoenix.AuthorizationController` and the fix was implemented by using `String.to_existing_atom/1` instead, as well as checking the value for binary provider in `PowAssent.Config.get_provider_config/2` and removing `String.to_atom/1` calls from `PowAssent.Plug.authorize_url/3` and `PowAssent.Plug.callback/4` in the vulnerable code.
*   The fix was introduced in version 0.4.4 of `pow_assent`.
*   The vulnerability is explicitly called out as a security issue in the changelog, and a related GitHub Security Advisory is available.
* The erlang.org document highlights the danger of `list_to_atom/1` (the erlang equivalent of `String.to_atom/1`) and suggests the use of `list_to_existing_atom/1` or `binary_to_existing_atom/1` as a safer alternative.
* There are no CWEs assigned to the vulnerability.

In summary, this CVE describes a denial-of-service vulnerability due to the unsafe use of `String.to_atom/1` with user-provided input. Attackers can exploit this to crash the application by exhausting the Erlang VM's atom table. The fix involved switching to `String.to_existing_atom/1`, which is safer.
