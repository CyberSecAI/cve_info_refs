Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16984:

**Root Cause:**
*   The file `app\recordings\recording_play.php` in FusionPBX versions up to 4.5.7 uses an unsanitized "filename" variable obtained from the URL. This variable is then reflected in the HTML, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS because it reflects user-supplied input (the "filename" parameter) in the HTML output without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the "filename" parameter. If a logged-in user clicks on this URL, the JavaScript code will be executed in their browser.
*   This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing the user's session cookie, defacing the web page, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vector:**
*   The attacker needs to entice an authenticated user to click on a specially crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code in the "filename" parameter.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and convince an authenticated user to click on it. This could be achieved through social engineering or by injecting the URL into a website or email.

**Mitigation:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in FusionPBX by sanitizing the "filename" variable before reflecting it in the HTML output.

**Additional details:**
* The reported identified the vulnerability on 14/08/2019 and it was fixed on 07/09/2019.
