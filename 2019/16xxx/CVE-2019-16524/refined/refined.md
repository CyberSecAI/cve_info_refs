Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16524:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Easy FancyBox WordPress plugin (versions 1.8.17 and earlier) is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the improper encoding of user-supplied settings parameters. Specifically, parameters such as `fancybox_titleColor` and `fancybox_paddingColor` from the plugin settings are embedded into CSS without sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin stores user-controlled data in the database and then outputs this data unsanitized as CSS.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize or escape user-provided input in the `fancybox_titleColor` and `fancybox_paddingColor` parameters before including them in the CSS.
- **CSS injection:**  The user-controlled parameters are directly included in CSS style blocks sent to the client's browser, which are included in every publicly accessible page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the CSS styles. When a user visits a page on the website, their browser will execute the injected JavaScript code.
- **Account Takeover:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers can potentially hijack administrative sessions, leading to a full website takeover.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** The attacker can execute arbitrary actions on behalf of the user, such as redirecting them to malicious websites, stealing cookies, or performing actions on the target website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the WordPress admin panel.
- The attacker navigates to the `Settings > Media` page of the WordPress admin.
- The attacker modifies the vulnerable plugin settings parameters such as `fancybox_titleColor` or `fancybox_paddingColor` with malicious JavaScript code.
- The injected code is then stored in the database. The injected JavaScript will be executed whenever a user visits a page of the website as the styles are loaded on every page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to have a high-privileged account (e.g. administrator or editor) on the target WordPress website in order to access the settings page.
