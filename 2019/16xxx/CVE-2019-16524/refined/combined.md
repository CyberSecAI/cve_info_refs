## Installation

Install like any other plugin. Search for ‘lightbox’ or ‘firelight’ or ‘easy fancybox’ from your WordPress admin plugin page. Or download the zip from this page, and upload the zip via your admin plugins page.

#### WordPress Multiste

The plugin is compatible with multisite. You can enable the plugin network wide, or allow individual sites to activate it.

When activating the plugin per site, each site will have the Images media type activated and Firelight Lightbox will immediately try opening image links in the light box.

When activated network wide with **Network Activate**, each sub-site will *not* have any media type activated. The options will be there for individual site admins, ready to either activate or leave deactivated.

# Easy FancyBox Wordpress Plugin Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

## Vulnerability Overview

The Easy FancyBox WordPress Plugin Version 1.8.17 is susceptible to Stored
Cross-site Scripting in the Settings > Media admin page `/wp-admin/options-media.php`
due to improper encoding of arbitrarily submitted setting parameters. The vulnerability
affects every publicly accessible page of the WordPress site.

* **Identifier** : SBA-ADV-20190911-01
* **Type of Vulnerability** : Cross-site Scripting
* **Software/Product Name** : [Easy FancyBox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/)
* **Vendor** : [RavanH](https://status301.net/)
* **Affected Versions** : <= 1.8.17
* **Fixed in Version** : 1.8.18
* **CVE ID** : CVE-2019-16524
* **CVSS Vector** : CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
* **CVSS Base Score** : 3.5 (Low)

## Vendor Description

> Easy FancyBox plugin for WordPress websites gives you a flexible and
> aesthetic light box solution for just about all media links on your website.
> Easy FancyBox uses an updated version of the traditional FancyBox jQuery
> extension and is WP 3+ Multi-Site compatible. After activation you can find
> a new section FancyBox on your Settings > Media admin page where you can
> manage the media light box options.

Source: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/>

## Impact

By exploiting the documented vulnerability, an attacker can execute
JavaScript code in a victim's browser within the origin of the target
site. This can be misused, for example, by taking over future administrative
web management sessions.

## Vulnerability Description

Several parameters of the file `/inc/class-easyfancybox.php` are affected by
stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The file is a part of the
Settings > Media admin page of the WordPress instance.

These setting parameters are embedded in CSS blocks without encoding or
sanitization, that are sent to the client's browser. The style sheet is sent
along with every publicly accessible page, no matter if the plugin is needed
on some pages or not.

For example, the following parameters are vulnerable:

* `/inc/class-easyfancybox.php`
  + fancybox\_titleColor
  + fancybox\_paddingColor

There are many more vulnerable parameters, the above listed are given only as
an example.

The vulnerabilities are located in `/inc/class-easyfancybox.php`:

```
[...]
		if ( !empty($paddingColor) )
			$content_style .= 'border-color:'.$paddingColor.';';
[...]
		if ( !empty($titleColor) )
			$styles .= '#fancybox-title,#fancybox-title-float-main{color:'.$titleColor.'}';
[...]
```

As the above code snippet shows, the parameters `$paddingColor` and
`$titleColor` contains user input and is concatenated into `$content_style`
or respectively `$styles` without performing any sanitization or escaping.

## Proof of Concept

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by, firstly having access to the
`Settings > Media page` within the administrative portal and secondly setting
as `$titleColor` the following string:

```
#44}</style><img src="" onerror="alert(1)">

```

This leads to the following HTML response (shortened for readability):

```
<style id='fancybox-inline-css' type='text/css'>
#fancybox-title,#fancybox-title-float-main{color:#44}</style><img src="" onerror="alert(1)">}
</style>
```

## Recommended Countermeasures

We recommend strictly whitelisting the user input before it is being used. The only
allowed characters should be alphanumeric characters and the hash sign.

## Timeline

* `2019-09-11` Identified the vulnerability in version 1.8.17
* `2019-09-11` Contacted the vendor via support
* `2019-09-16` Vendor closed the vulnerability in version 1.8.18
* `2019-09-25` Publication of CVE-2019-16524

## Installation

Install like any other plugin. Search for ‘lightbox’ or ‘firelight’ or ‘easy fancybox’ from your WordPress admin plugin page. Or download the zip from this page, and upload the zip via your admin plugins page.

#### WordPress Multiste

The plugin is compatible with multisite. You can enable the plugin network wide, or allow individual sites to activate it.

When activating the plugin per site, each site will have the Images media type activated and Firelight Lightbox will immediately try opening image links in the light box.

When activated network wide with **Network Activate**, each sub-site will *not* have any media type activated. The options will be there for individual site admins, ready to either activate or leave deactivated.

Hi, I just wanted to let you know, that I like using this lightbox feature on my wordpress site for its simplicity and reliable performance for many years. I am using an older theme now and will transition soon to a FSE Theme.
