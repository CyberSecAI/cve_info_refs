Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `xml_cdr_delete.php` file of FusionPBX. It uses an unsanitized "rec" variable from the URL. This variable, which is supposed to contain the path to recording files, is base64 decoded and directly used in a file deletion function (`unlink`), allowing for path traversal and arbitrary file deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the 'rec' parameter.  An attacker can manipulate this parameter to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to reach and delete any file on the server's filesystem accessible to the webserver process.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The use of `unlink()` on the decoded path, without proper validation or sanitization, enables the deletion of files outside of the intended recording directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to delete any file on the server's file system that is accessible by the webserver user. This can lead to:
    -  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Deleting critical system files or application data.
    -  **Data Loss:** Deleting recordings or other user data.
    -  **System Compromise:** Deleting configuration files, leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET/POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request to the `xml_cdr_delete.php` script. Specifically, the `rec` parameter within the URL or POST data would be modified to include a base64 encoded path to a file that the attacker wants to delete.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the FusionPBX application.
- **Knowledge of target system paths:** While path traversal can assist, knowing the path of the files to be deleted is needed for effective exploitation.
