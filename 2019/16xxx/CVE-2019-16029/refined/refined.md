**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the application programming interface (API) of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation in the API.
- This allows for the manipulation of user account information through crafted HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can prevent legitimate users from logging into the web interface by changing or corrupting user account information.
- **Potential for Administrator Access:** An attacker might gain administrator privileges by manipulating user account data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can send crafted HTTP requests to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system.
- No authentication is required.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability in Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to modify user account information via a crafted HTTP request due to a lack of input validation in the API. This can lead to a denial of service, preventing legitimate user access, and potentially granting the attacker administrative privileges.
