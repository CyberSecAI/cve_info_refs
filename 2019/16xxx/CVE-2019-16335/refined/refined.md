{
  "CVE-2019-16335": {
    "Description": "A polymorphic typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.9.10. It is related to com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform remote code execution using crafted JSON messages.  ",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a polymorphic typing issue in the FasterXML jackson-databind library. This library does not properly validate user input before attempting deserialization. Specifically, crafted JSON messages can be used to trigger the instantiation of malicious objects through the polymorphic type handling mechanisms, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Polymorphic typing vulnerability",
      "Unsafe deserialization of untrusted data",
      "Use of default typing feature"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could enable an attacker to gain full control of the affected system, allowing them to execute any command, steal data, or cause denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote, via network protocols like HTTP or others that can process JSON messages",
      "Injected malicious JSON input"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted JSON payloads to a vulnerable application that utilizes jackson-databind's unsafe polymorphic typing features and where the com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource class is present in the classpath.",
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.9.10 of FasterXML jackson-databind.",
      "The root cause is that the library attempts to instantiate objects based on type information included in the JSON input, without sufficient validation.",
      "The vulnerability can be exploited through a web service or any application accepting JSON input that relies on jackson-databind.",
         "The vulnerability is triggered with the 'enableDefaultTyping()' function or with @JsonTypeInfo using Id.CLASS or Id.MINIMAL_CLASS. "
