  "CVE-2019-16297": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The p4tutorial app's host event listener only handles the HOST_ADDED event type and does not handle HOST_MOVED, HOST_REMOVED, or HOST_UPDATED event types.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing event handling: The application does not handle host-related events such as host movement, removal, and updates."
      ],
      "impact": "A host's information can change without the application being notified, potentially leading to denial-of-service or stale flow rules not being removed.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "An attacker can manipulate host events (e.g., through ARP spoofing) to trigger a HOST_MOVED, HOST_REMOVED, or HOST_UPDATED event."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to inject data plane packets into the network, and can potentially be an already compromised host. No direct access to controller or app is needed."
    },
    "additional_details": "The provided content describes the EVENTSCOPE tool which identifies cross-plane, event-based vulnerabilities, and it discovers 14 vulnerabilities in ONOS, one of which is CVE-2019-16297. The vulnerability is a result of the p4tutorial app not handling several host event types. This lack of handling can lead to stale flow rules and possible denial of service."
