Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-16301:

**CVE-2019-16301** appears in Table I as one of the 14 vulnerabilities discovered by the tool EVENTSCOPE. This vulnerability is in the `vtn` app and relates to the `HOST MOVED` event type not being handled.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `vtn` (virtual tenant network) app in ONOS does not handle the `HOST MOVED` event type. This means that when a host's location changes within the network, the `vtn` app does not take any action to update its internal state or network configurations related to that host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Event Handler:** The core weakness is the absence of a specific event handler for `HOST MOVED` events within the `vtn` app. This leads to a discrepancy between the actual state of the network (a host has moved) and the `vtn` app's awareness of that state.
*  **Incomplete Update Semantics**:  The `vtn` app handles other host-related events, like `HOST_ADDED`, `HOST_REMOVED`, and `HOST_UPDATED`, but not `HOST_MOVED`.  This inconsistency in handling different types of host changes leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** As the `vtn` app does not react to `HOST MOVED` events, flow rules related to the moved host are not reinstalled, which can cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Data Plane Manipulation:** Attackers can use data plane packets (e.g., ARP replies) to spoof host locations and trigger the `HOST MOVED` event.
*   **Host Migration:** Legitimate host migration events could also trigger this vulnerability, disrupting services dependent on the `vtn` app's correct functioning.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control of a Data Plane Host:** Attackers need to have control over at least one host within the network to send crafted data plane packets.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have the ability to interact with the network to send packets that trigger host movement events.
*   **Understanding of SDN Events:** A basic knowledge of how SDN events and host tracking work would be beneficial for the attacker to craft the attack.

**Additional Details from the Document:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using the EVENTSCOPE tool, which uses static analysis and event flow graphs to analyze SDN control plane interactions.
*  The provided event flow graph shows that the  `hostDetected()` API call, triggered by data plane input, eventually leads to a call to  `vtn.InternalHostListener` API, but this listener does not have code to react to `HOST_MOVED` events.
*   The document also highlights the broader issue of apps that rely on helper apps for functionality but don't fully consider the effects of these apps' actions, which contributes to the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2019-16301 arises from a missing event handler in the `vtn` app, allowing attackers (or natural host migration) to cause the app to lose track of host movement and leading to denial of service due to stale or missing flow rules. The attack vector involves the data plane by spoofing host locations to trigger a `HOST MOVED` event, and knowledge of SDN events and host tracking would help to leverage the vulnerability.
