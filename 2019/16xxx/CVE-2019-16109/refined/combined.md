### Commits on Sep 4, 2019

1. [Always return an error when](/heartcombo/devise/commit/fee43f3c11e176c53c5c3bfda7fd2e97c4c912be) `[confirmation_token](/heartcombo/devise/commit/fee43f3c11e176c53c5c3bfda7fd2e97c4c912be)` [is blank (](/heartcombo/devise/commit/fee43f3c11e176c53c5c3bfda7fd2e97c4c912be)[#5132](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/5132)[)](/heartcombo/devise/commit/fee43f3c11e176c53c5c3bfda7fd2e97c4c912be)
    …

   ```
   As reported in [#5071](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5071), if
   for some reason, a user in the database had the `confirmation_token`
   column as a blank string, Devise would confirm that user after receiving
   a request with a blank `confirmation_token` parameter.
   After this commit, a request sending a blank `confirmation_token`
   parameter will receive a validation error.
   For applications that have users with a blank `confirmation_token` in
   the database, it's recommended to manually regenerate or to nullify
   them.

### @tegon **[tegon](/tegon)** commented [Sep 2, 2019](#issue-488286987)

As reported in [#5071](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5071), if for some reason, a user in the database had the `confirmation_token`

column as a blank string, Devise would confirm that user after receiving a request with a blank `confirmation_token` parameter.

After this commit, a request sending a blank `confirmation_token` parameter will always receive a validation error, even if there are users with a blank `confirmation_token` in the database.

For applications that have users with a blank `confirmation_token` in the database, it's recommended to manually regenerate or to nullify them.

Closes [#5071](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5071)

As written, this code may leak information about the internal state of the database (that some records have blank tokens). Could we check for presence of confirmation\_token before the call to `find_first_by_auth_conditions`?

I'm not sure about that. It's the same response as when there are no records with blank tokens. Do you think this is still leaking information?

If that's the case then I guess it's probably ok for now, but if the `find_or_initialize_with_error_by` or `token_generator` methods change, it could unintentionally create an information leakage issue here. I think it'd be safer to just return early (without making any queries) if we detect that the token is blank.

```
if confirmation_token.blank?
  confirmable = new
  confirmable.errors.add(:confirmation_token, :blank)
  return confirmable
end
```

Do you have examples of which kind of changes could cause leaks?

Any change that would result in a different response being returned when the token is blank and there is no record in the database.

Examples:

* `TokenGenerator#digest` changes to return a digest even when `value` is blank. This may result in a record being initialized and returned with error set to `:invalid` instead of `:blank`.
* `find_or_initialize_with_error_by` changes to always use the provided `error` argument instead of special-casing blank errors.

Ok, get it. Both of these cases would be caught by our integration tests, so I guess this implementation is fine.

But since we already know there's no need to perform the query I guess it's better to return early as you mentioned. It also shows better the intention behind the code, which is to validate whether the parameter is present or not.

I think it's better to keep since that's the behavior we're trying to ensure it doesn't happen anymore.

I know that since the current code validates the parameter before doing anything else, it's unlikely for this to happen, but this test ensures we don't add regressions in the future.

```
[…#5132](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/5132))

As reported in [heartcombo#5071](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5071), if
for some reason, a user in the database had the `confirmation_token`
column as a blank string, Devise would confirm that user after receiving
a request with a blank `confirmation_token` parameter.
After this commit, a request sending a blank `confirmation_token`
parameter will receive a validation error.
For applications that have users with a blank `confirmation_token` in
the database, it's recommended to manually regenerate or to nullify
them.

## Description

![@ajsharp](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12774?u=546f0ae6e751b05cd51add6ace714478428292ea&v=4&size=48)[ajsharp](https://github.com/ajsharp)opened [on May 4, 2019](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/5071#issue-440263672)
## Environment

* Ruby 2.5.5p157
* Rails 5.2.3
* Devise 4.6.1

## Current behavior

Currently, when using the confirmable module, devise only checks if the `confirmation_token` field not nil. If it's nil, it will generate a confirmation token for you; if it's not, it won't. However, it can be set to an empty string, which should not be allowed, as it presents a security issue, allowing someone passing an empty string as the confirmation token to sign in as the person with the blank string confirmation token.

This is the offending code: <https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/e91b8ee0bac0503af119bf7333499d7729166a4d/lib/devise/models/confirmable.rb#L249>

## Expected behavior

Devise should do something like `if self.confirmation_token.present?`, which checks for nil and blank.
