# [WiX v3.11.2 released](/blog/2019/9/18/wix-v3.11.2-released/)

Wednesday, September 18, 2019
 by Rob Mensching

WiX v3.11.2 is a minor security release of WiX. If your application directly references Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.Cab.dll or Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.Zip.dll to decompress cabinet or zip files to a folder, you should upgrade to this release. Otherwise, feel free to stay with WiX v3.11.1.

This security release addresses a [*"Zip Slip"* vulnerability](https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/issues/6075) in the decompression code provided by DTF, specifically: Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.Cab.dll and Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.Zip.dll. "Zip Slip" occurs when a malicious archive (cabinet or zip) file contains a filename with traversal paths (`..\`) such that vulnerable decompression code could overwrite files unexpectedly. See the [WIP](https://wixtoolset.org/development/wips/6075-dtf-zip-slip/) for more details.

We developed a targeted fix in the shared functionality for cabinet and zip file compression and decompression. Again, if your project references Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.Cab.dll or Microsoft.Deployment.Compression.Zip.dll then you will want to upgrade to WiX v3.11.2. There are no other changes in WiX v3.11.2.

The vulnerability was first reported to us by Devin Casadey of Secureworks. We appreciate the professionalism and completeness of his security report.

Please provide answers to the following questions to help us narrow down, reproduce, and fix the problem. Fill out one section and delete the others.

* Which version of WiX are you building with?

> WiX v3.11.1

* Which version of Visual Studio are you building with (if any)?

> N/A

* Which version of the WiX Toolset Visual Studio Extension are you building with (if any)?

> N/A

* Which version of .NET are you building with?

> Any

* If the problem occurs when installing your packages built with WiX, what is the version of Windows the package is running on?

> N/A

* Describe the problem and the steps to reproduce it.

> A maliciously crafted cabinet or zip file can be created with traversal paths in the archived file names. For example, `..\..\hackedu.dll`. DTF's `ArchiveFileStreamContext` will concatenate the archived file path with a provided base directory, such that the traversal path can place the file outside the provided base directory and possibly overwriting the user's files. This is known as [Zip Slip](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability).

* Describe the behavior you expected and how it differed from the actual behavior.

> DTF should not write files outside the extraction folder.

> This issue was originally reported by Devin Casadey.
