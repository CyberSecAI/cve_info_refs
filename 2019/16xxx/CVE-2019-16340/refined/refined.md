Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-16340

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the API of `/sysinfo_json.cgi`. Requesting this URL leaks sensitive information, specifically the WPS PIN and device recovery key, due to the lack of proper access control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The `/sysinfo_json.cgi` API endpoint exposes sensitive information without authentication.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The leaked WPS PIN and Device Recovery Key can be used to bypass authentication.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is a type of IDOR, where the system directly exposes internal system details, rather than restricting their accessibility.
- **Missing Access Control:** There is no access control to ensure the sensitive information is not exposed to unauthenticated users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Router Control:** An unauthenticated attacker can obtain the device's WPS PIN and Recovery Key.
- **Unauthorized Network Access:** The WPS PIN allows unauthorized connection to the WiFi network even when the password is changed.
- **Admin Password Reset:** The recovery key can be used to reset the administrator password to a value chosen by the attacker, granting full administrative control over the device.
- **Complete Device Compromise:** This can lead to the attacker having the ability to configure the device, intercept traffic, or use the device in other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Linksys Velop device.
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specific HTTP GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint `/sysinfo_json.cgi`.
- **JNAP request:** The attacker crafts a specific POST request to JNAP with obtained device recovery key to change admin password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same local network as the Linksys Velop router.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs to send a specifically crafted HTTP GET request and POST request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in firmware versions prior to 1.1.8.192419.
- Linksys released a patch in August 2019 to address this issue.
- The fix is included in firmware version 1.1.9.195026, released July 22, 2019.
- The affected products are the Linksys Velop WHW03 series.
- The specific models are WHW0303, WHW0302, and WHW0301.
