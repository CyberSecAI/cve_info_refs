Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `map_style` attribute within the `locations_map` and `events_map` shortcodes of the Events Manager WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin decodes the base64 encoded JSON object provided in the `map_style` attribute and inserts it directly into a `<script>` tag without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Arbitrary HTML and JavaScript can be injected into the `map_style` attribute, which is then stored in the database and executed when the page is loaded.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or encode the data received through the `map_style` attribute, allowing malicious code to bypass shortcode sanitization measures.
- **Lack of Output Encoding:**  The decoded `map_json_style` variable is inserted directly into the HTML output within a `<script>` tag without any encoding or sanitization, leading to the XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to inject fake login forms to steal user credentials.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user, potentially leading to account compromise or further malicious actions, depending on the user's level of access.
- **Server Compromise (for Admin Users):** If an administrator is targeted, the attacker could potentially execute PHP code and compromise the entire server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Shortcode Injection:** The attack vector is through the insertion of a specially crafted shortcode into a WordPress post or page.
- **`map_style` Attribute:** The `map_style` attribute of the `locations_map` or `events_map` shortcodes is the vehicle for the attack, by using a base64 encoded JSON object that contains malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an account on the WordPress site with the ability to create or edit posts.
- **Knowledge of Shortcodes:** The attacker needs to know how to use the `locations_map` or `events_map` shortcodes and their attributes.
- **Base64 Encoding Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to encode their malicious javascript in base64 to bypass sanitization.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the Events Manager plugin up to and including 5.9.5.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.9.6.
- The provided content gives a clear Proof of Concept.
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed and fixed, with a timeline available.
