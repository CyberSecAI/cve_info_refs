```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `processCommandSetMac()` function in the `udpServerSys` service constructs a shell command using user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation. This allows for command injection via the MAC address parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Command Injection: User-supplied data is directly inserted into a shell command without proper sanitization or validation.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary command execution: Attackers can inject malicious commands to execute arbitrary code on the device with root privileges.
- Complete device compromise: Successful exploitation allows for full control over the affected device, potentially including access to sensitive data, modification of device settings, and the ability to use the device for further attacks.

Attack vectors:
- Network-based attack: Exploitation occurs by sending a crafted UDP packet to port 9003.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network connectivity: The attacker must be able to reach the device on port 9003.
- No authentication: No authentication is required to send the malicious UDP packet to the `udpServerSys` service.
