ManageWP is a part of my morning routine. I just login and start updating different sites. I use it to manage over 100 sites. It's just a great tool that really saves me a huge amount of time everyday.

— Mike Little

In our opinion, ManageWP's best kept secret is their Client Reports feature. There is nothing more valuable than clear documentation to show our clients the work we’ve performed. The fact that reports are customizable and multilingual puts ManageWP leagues ahead of competitors.

— Jean-Francois Arseneault, SatelliteWP

With an incredibly rich feature set, a solid and dependable service, I recommend ManageWP to anyone who is taking WordPress Maintenance Management seriously.

— Remkus de Vries, buro KREAS

We tested out most, if not all the WP management software out there, and nothing compares to what ManageWP provides.

— Jeremy Choi, WPUP

ManageWP saves me dozens of hours each month (not to mention liberating me from the tedium of administering so many sites). ManageWP has never failed me. Not once.

— Douglas McLennan, ArtsJournal

Backups run flawlessly in the background without me having to lift a finger, and I get notified immediately if any of my sites are down.

— Anita Henderson, i4design

One particular feature that has helped us again and again is the ability to filter through all of our sites looking for a specific plugin. When we find out a certain plugin has a security vulnerability of some kind, we’re able to quickly find all of the affected client sites, and push out fixes right away.

— Ryan D. Sullivan, WP Site Care

We manage a lot of sites and when they go offline, we lose money. I love that ManageWP sends me a text notifying me if my website is no longer responsive. This way I see it quicker, can get it up sooner and less money is lost. ManageWP pays for itself.

— David Aston, IncomeDiary

## Description

The fastest and most accurate broken link checker for WordPress. Join over 700K people who use Broken Link Checker to monitor and detect broken links 20x faster than other plugins, with pinpoint accuracy. No page limits, no ads, no upsells. Enjoy effortless, unlimited, and automated broken link checking from the get-go.

**Broken links can kill your SEO, user experience, and site health… Broken Link Checker helps you find and resolve them faster than similar plugins.**

Finding and staying on top of broken links can feel like a never-ending battle, especially if you’re dealing with large sites or managing multiple.

Using a link checking tool can save you from having to find links manually, or avoid the frustration of discovering missed broken links months later (oops!).

But not every broken link checker was created equal…

You need a tool that not only automates the process, but also detects broken links quickly, thoroughly, and accurately.

**That’s where Broken Link Checker comes in…**

BLC doesn’t *just* scan your sites faster than other solutions, it scans deeply and frequently to ensure no broken links are missed.

Scan every inch of your sites, including external and internal links within your posts, pages, comments, blogroll, even custom fields, helping to ensure your site’s SEO and user experience are not compromised in any way. And if that isn’t enough, you’ll also receive detection reports via email so you can quickly take corrective action.

**Choose from two different link checking engines:**

Broken Link Checker gives you the option of using two unique engines based on your needs. You can also easily switch between local and cloud broken link checking **without losing your saved settings.**

**1.Cloud-based link checker**

This engine is 100% cloud-based and built directly on WPMU DEV’s servers (the owners of BLC), harnessing their powerful API.

*Note that our cloud-based engine is still in beta. We’re working around the clock to make this new version even better. As mentioned, if it’s missing a feature you need, simply switch back to the local version.*

This cloud-based engine gives you several advantages, including:

* **20x more speed** – Being cloud-based eliminates any dependence on the performance of your server, giving you a massive speed increase.
* **Unlimited page & URL checker** – Enjoy limitless scanning for pages and URLs, ideal if you’re working with multiple sites or large sites with a lot of content.
* **Edit/unlink broken links (coming soon)** – Effortlessly resolve all detected links right from your BLC dashboard.
* **Crawl it all** – Standard pages and posts, menus, category pages… BLC ensures no URL is missed.
* **Any site, any size** – Unlike plugin-based solutions, BLC is server-independent, making it capable of checking sites of any size and type.
* **Fewer errors** – BLC’s cloud-based nature eliminates the occurrence of WP Errors, Fatal Errors, DB Errors, and PHP Errors often present with other plugins.
* **Less chance of being blocked** – The cloud-based engine doesn’t use your site’s IP address to check external URLs, meaning you’re less likely to be blocked due to frequent requests.

**Plus, manage broken links for unlimited sites from one place**

Since the cloud-based engine connects you to WPMU DEV, you have the luxury of free access to their suite of powerful web development tools – including a convenient site management interface where you can manage broken links on multiple sites, rather than just one.

**2. Local link checker**

The main difference of our local link checker compared to the cloud engine, is that it uses your site/server resources to fetch and analyze site content and check the status of links.

It also uses your site’s IP address, which as mentioned above, increases your risk of being blocked by some external links, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate scan results.

**Here are the standout features of the local link checking engine:**

* Monitors external links and internal links in your posts, pages, comments, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).
* Detects broken links and redirects.
* Receive notifications via your dashboard or email.
* Make broken links display differently in posts (optional).
* Prevent search engines from following broken links (optional).
* Search and filter links by URL, anchor text and more.
* Edit links directly from your interface, without manually updating each post.

Whether you choose local or cloud-based, BLC’s user-friendly dashboard and powerful features makes staying on top of broken links as easy and automated as possible.

### The best scanning & detection features on one dashboard:

**Run manual scans or set an automatic schedule**

Enjoy the flexibility to run scans manually, or schedule automatic daily, weekly, and monthly scans to suit your preference and the sites you manage.

**Edit or unlink broken links (coming soon to cloud-based)**

After BLC detects broken links, it gives you the option to edit or unlink them with a click from your main dashboard. It couldn’t be easier or faster.

**Detailed broken link reports**

After each scan you get a comprehensive summary of any broken links detected, along with the status of the links so you can instantly know how to resolve the issue.

**Detection notifications via email**

Stay on top of your link health and fix issues as fast as possible with broken link reports sent straight to an email address of your choice.

**Advanced search filtering**

BLC’s search and filtering tools make it faster and easier to find specific URLs or filter by status or error type.

**Export report lists for further analysis**

Export your broken link lists as a CSV file for greater analysis inside of Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and other spreadsheet/data software.

### HELP KEEP BLC SECURE

We take plugin security incredibly seriously; if you have a bug or vulnerability to report, you can do so through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. It’s fast, easy, and you will be notified when the issue is fixed. [Report a vulnerability](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/broken-link-checker).

Uninstalling now, it rates hundreds of referral links as 403, not workable.However, I would rate it 4 stars as the support was very good. And the help they offered was refused by the site referring to, so their fault, not Broken Link checker.I hope their will be a work-around this issue at some point.

I’m still using the local checker, not the cloud version, because I’d rather keep the backend data myself if I can. It does a great job checking and classifying all the links on your site and making them searchable and easily editable. I particularly like that it can update redirected links, check the Wayback Machine for missing ones, and makes it easy to update one at a time or in bulk.

Плагин работает, регулярно присылает письмо с неработающими ссылками и картинками. Облачная версия совсем не понравилась, неудобная. А в локальной версии есть серьезная недоработка. Если у вас несколько тысяч битых картинок, то удалить их можно только партиями по 30 шт. Было бы хорошо, если можно было задать количество отображаемых ссылок на странице, к примеру 100-300-500-1000 ссылок.

Broken Link Checker is an incredibly helpful plugin that I use frequently. One of its standout features is the ability to edit broken links directly from the plugin’s panel without having to open and modify the article itself.
A suggestion for improvement would be to update the modification date of the article when fixing a link. This would signal to search engines that the article has been updated, reflecting the correction of the broken link. Overall, a fantastic plugin that I highly recommend!

This plugin used to be great but since being taken over by WPMU and the PRO CLOUD version being released, it dies not find any broken links anymore.
I found an alternative plugin in the Wordpress Directory, which worked great out of the box and discovered more than 200 broken links within a couple of hours.

* Enabled the YouTube video checker by default on new installations.

* Added a Vietnamese translation.
* Added file-based logging for debugging purposes. Logging can be enabled in the “Advanced” section of the plugin settings page.
* Added a “Auto-Submitted: auto-generated” header to notification emails sent by the plugin. This should prevent “out-of-office” auto-responders and similar software from responding to these emails.
* Added domain-based rate limiting to the HTTP checker module.
* Throttled background parsing by about 40% to reduce overall resource usage.

#### 1.9

* Added a Hebrew translation.
* Added support for HTML code in custom fields. To make the plugin treat a field as HTML, prefix its name with “html:” in BLC settings. For example, if you have a custom field named “foo” that contains HTML, enter it as “html:foo”.
* Fixed: The “Status” column is now properly updated when editing a link.
* Fixed: Visual feedback when a link is successfully edited. Basically, it briefly changes the row background to green.
* Fixed: Email notifications will only include the “see all broken links here” link if the recipient can actually access that link.
* Fixed some UI labels not being localizable.
* The “Undismiss” action is now displayed in all views instead of only the “Dismissed” view. This way you can tell if a broken link has been dismissed without having to search the “Dismissed” list.

#### 1.6.1

* Fixed the “database not up to date” bug. Now the plugin should properly upgrade the DB.

#### 1.6

* Added a way to dismiss links. Dismissed links don’t show up in the “Broken” and “Redirects” lists, but are still checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. strike-through for broken links). Useful if you want to, for example, acknowledge that a link is broken and leave it be.

* Updated French translation.
* Tested on WP 3.4.1.
* Replace the “More plugins…” link on the “Broken Links” page with a link to the Admin Menu Editor page. This link will be hidden for users who have donated.

# WordPress Plugin - Broken Link Checker - Reflected XSS

## Vulnerability Overview

The broken-link-checker plugin through 1.11.8 for WordPress (aka Broken Link Checker)
is susceptible to Reflected XSS due to improper encoding and insertion of an HTTP GET
parameter into HTML. The filter function on the page listing all detected broken links
can be exploited by providing an XSS payload in the s\_filter GET parameter in a
filter\_id=search request.
NOTE: this is an end-of-life product.

* **Identifier** : SBA-ADV-20190913-02
* **Type of Vulnerability** : Cross-site Scripting
* **Software/Product Name** : [Broken Link Checker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/)
* **Vendor** : [ManageWP](https://managewp.com/)
* **Affected Versions** : <= 1.11.8
* **Fixed in Version** : -
* **CVE ID** : CVE-2019-16521
* **CVSSv3 Vector** : AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
* **CVSSv3 Base Score** : 8.1 (High)

## Vendor Description

> This plugin will monitor your blog looking for broken links and let you know if any are found.

Active Installations: 700,000+

Source: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/>

## Impact

By exploiting the documented vulnerability, an external attacker without
any privileges can execute JavaScript code in a victim's browser.
This can be misused, e.g for phishing attacks by displaying a fake
login form and sending the victim's credentials to the attacker.
Furthermore malicious actions can be performed in the context of an authenticated
user. The impact depends on the level of access of the attacked user.
In case of an admin this can lead to the execution of PHP code and the compromise
of the server.

## Vulnerability Description

The filter function on the page listing all detected broken links can be exploited
by providing HTML and JavaScript code in one of the parameters.
All users with access to the "Broken Link Checker" are in danger.

This is possible because the CSS class of the table contains the value of the
`s_filter` GET parameter if it is not empty. Additionally it is necessary to provide
the special filter id "search" via parameter `filter_id=search` in order to reach this
execution path:

In `includes/link-query.php` (L803-810) the value of `$base_filter` is determined,
with `filter_id=search` the right path will be reached:

```
$base_filter = '';
if ( array_key_exists($filter_id, $this->native_filters) ) {
    $base_filter = $filter_id;
} else if ( isset($current_filter['params']['s_filter']) && !empty($current_filter['params']['s_filter']) ) {
    $base_filter = $current_filter['params']['s_filter'];
} else if ( isset($_GET['s_filter']) && !empty($_GET['s_filter']) ) {
    $base_filter = $_GET['s_filter'];
}
```

In `admin/table-printer.php` (L71-82) the value of the CSS class of the table is determined and set.
Here the value of the GET parameter is inside `$current_filter['base_filter']`.

```
$table_classes = array( 'widefat' );
if ( $compact ) {
    $table_classes[] = 'compact';
};
if ( $this->core->conf->options['table_color_code_status'] ) {
    $table_classes[] = 'color-code-link-status';
};
$table_classes[] = 'base-filter-' . $current_filter['base_filter'];
printf(
    '<table class="%s" id="blc-links"><thead><tr>',
    implode( ' ', $table_classes )
);
```

## Proof of Concept

This example shows how an attacker can craft a URL to execute a payload in the
browser of the victim. When a user clicks on the link and is logged-in, the payload
(in this case a simple JavaScript alert) will be executed. Otherwise the user will be taken
to the login page and redirected to the exploit after a successful login.
Replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE>` with the URL to your WordPress installation:

```
<YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE>/wp-admin/tools.php?page=view-broken-links&filter_id=search&s_filter=%22+id%3D%22blc-links%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

```

## Recommended Countermeasures

We recommend to properly escape the output by using the encoding functions provided by WordPress,
like the `esc_*`- or `wp_kses_*`-[functions](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/data-sanitization-escaping/#escaping-securing-output).

## Description

The fastest and most accurate broken link checker for WordPress. Join over 700K people who use Broken Link Checker to monitor and detect broken links 20x faster than other plugins, with pinpoint accuracy. No page limits, no ads, no upsells. Enjoy effortless, unlimited, and automated broken link checking from the get-go.

**Broken links can kill your SEO, user experience, and site health… Broken Link Checker helps you find and resolve them faster than similar plugins.**

Finding and staying on top of broken links can feel like a never-ending battle, especially if you’re dealing with large sites or managing multiple.

Using a link checking tool can save you from having to find links manually, or avoid the frustration of discovering missed broken links months later (oops!).

But not every broken link checker was created equal…

You need a tool that not only automates the process, but also detects broken links quickly, thoroughly, and accurately.

**That’s where Broken Link Checker comes in…**

BLC doesn’t *just* scan your sites faster than other solutions, it scans deeply and frequently to ensure no broken links are missed.

Scan every inch of your sites, including external and internal links within your posts, pages, comments, blogroll, even custom fields, helping to ensure your site’s SEO and user experience are not compromised in any way. And if that isn’t enough, you’ll also receive detection reports via email so you can quickly take corrective action.

**Choose from two different link checking engines:**

Broken Link Checker gives you the option of using two unique engines based on your needs. You can also easily switch between local and cloud broken link checking **without losing your saved settings.**

**1.Cloud-based link checker**

This engine is 100% cloud-based and built directly on WPMU DEV’s servers (the owners of BLC), harnessing their powerful API.

*Note that our cloud-based engine is still in beta. We’re working around the clock to make this new version even better. As mentioned, if it’s missing a feature you need, simply switch back to the local version.*

This cloud-based engine gives you several advantages, including:

* **20x more speed** – Being cloud-based eliminates any dependence on the performance of your server, giving you a massive speed increase.
* **Unlimited page & URL checker** – Enjoy limitless scanning for pages and URLs, ideal if you’re working with multiple sites or large sites with a lot of content.
* **Edit/unlink broken links (coming soon)** – Effortlessly resolve all detected links right from your BLC dashboard.
* **Crawl it all** – Standard pages and posts, menus, category pages… BLC ensures no URL is missed.
* **Any site, any size** – Unlike plugin-based solutions, BLC is server-independent, making it capable of checking sites of any size and type.
* **Fewer errors** – BLC’s cloud-based nature eliminates the occurrence of WP Errors, Fatal Errors, DB Errors, and PHP Errors often present with other plugins.
* **Less chance of being blocked** – The cloud-based engine doesn’t use your site’s IP address to check external URLs, meaning you’re less likely to be blocked due to frequent requests.

**Plus, manage broken links for unlimited sites from one place**

Since the cloud-based engine connects you to WPMU DEV, you have the luxury of free access to their suite of powerful web development tools – including a convenient site management interface where you can manage broken links on multiple sites, rather than just one.

**2. Local link checker**

The main difference of our local link checker compared to the cloud engine, is that it uses your site/server resources to fetch and analyze site content and check the status of links.

It also uses your site’s IP address, which as mentioned above, increases your risk of being blocked by some external links, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate scan results.

**Here are the standout features of the local link checking engine:**

* Monitors external links and internal links in your posts, pages, comments, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).
* Detects broken links and redirects.
* Receive notifications via your dashboard or email.
* Make broken links display differently in posts (optional).
* Prevent search engines from following broken links (optional).
* Search and filter links by URL, anchor text and more.
* Edit links directly from your interface, without manually updating each post.

Whether you choose local or cloud-based, BLC’s user-friendly dashboard and powerful features makes staying on top of broken links as easy and automated as possible.

### The best scanning & detection features on one dashboard:

**Run manual scans or set an automatic schedule**

Enjoy the flexibility to run scans manually, or schedule automatic daily, weekly, and monthly scans to suit your preference and the sites you manage.

**Edit or unlink broken links (coming soon to cloud-based)**

After BLC detects broken links, it gives you the option to edit or unlink them with a click from your main dashboard. It couldn’t be easier or faster.

**Detailed broken link reports**

After each scan you get a comprehensive summary of any broken links detected, along with the status of the links so you can instantly know how to resolve the issue.

**Detection notifications via email**

Stay on top of your link health and fix issues as fast as possible with broken link reports sent straight to an email address of your choice.

**Advanced search filtering**

BLC’s search and filtering tools make it faster and easier to find specific URLs or filter by status or error type.

**Export report lists for further analysis**

Export your broken link lists as a CSV file for greater analysis inside of Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and other spreadsheet/data software.

Uninstalling now, it rates hundreds of referral links as 403, not workable.However, I would rate it 4 stars as the support was very good. And the help they offered was refused by the site referring to, so their fault, not Broken Link checker.I hope their will be a work-around this issue at some point.

even if it’s not 100% correct, it does a great job in supervising all the Links on a website

I’m still using the local checker, not the cloud version, because I’d rather keep the backend data myself if I can. It does a great job checking and classifying all the links on your site and making them searchable and easily editable. I particularly like that it can update redirected links, check the Wayback Machine for missing ones, and makes it easy to update one at a time or in bulk.

Плагин работает, регулярно присылает письмо с неработающими ссылками и картинками. Облачная версия совсем не понравилась, неудобная. А в локальной версии есть серьезная недоработка. Если у вас несколько тысяч битых картинок, то удалить их можно только партиями по 30 шт. Было бы хорошо, если можно было задать количество отображаемых ссылок на странице, к примеру 100-300-500-1000 ссылок.

Broken Link Checker is an incredibly helpful plugin that I use frequently. One of its standout features is the ability to edit broken links directly from the plugin’s panel without having to open and modify the article itself.
A suggestion for improvement would be to update the modification date of the article when fixing a link. This would signal to search engines that the article has been updated, reflecting the correction of the broken link. Overall, a fantastic plugin that I highly recommend!

This plugin used to be great but since being taken over by WPMU and the PRO CLOUD version being released, it dies not find any broken links anymore.
I found an alternative plugin in the Wordpress Directory, which worked great out of the box and discovered more than 200 broken links within a couple of hours.
What happened to Broken Link Checker?

* Enabled the YouTube video checker by default on new installations.
* Made the “dismiss link” option more permanent. Instead of restoring a dismissed link if the redirect URL changes even a little bit, the plugin will now ignore query string changes. This should fix many of the reports about dismissed links reappearing for no apparent reason.

* Other minor fixes.

#### 1.9.4.2

* Updated Dutch translation again.
* Removed Bulgarian translation because it was poor quality and outdated.

* Added a Vietnamese translation.
* Added file-based logging for debugging purposes. Logging can be enabled in the “Advanced” section of the plugin settings page.
* Added a “Auto-Submitted: auto-generated” header to notification emails sent by the plugin. This should prevent “out-of-office” auto-responders and similar software from responding to these emails.

* Added a Hebrew translation.
* Added support for HTML code in custom fields. To make the plugin treat a field as HTML, prefix its name with “html:” in BLC settings. For example, if you have a custom field named “foo” that contains HTML, enter it as “html:foo”.

* Fixed: Email notifications will only include the “see all broken links here” link if the recipient can actually access that link.
* Fixed some UI labels not being localizable.
* The “Undismiss” action is now displayed in all views instead of only the “Dismissed” view. This way you can tell if a broken link has been dismissed without having to search the “Dismissed” list.

#### 1.8.3

#### 1.6.1

* Fixed the “database not up to date” bug. Now the plugin should properly upgrade the DB.

#### 1.6

* Added a way to dismiss links. Dismissed links don’t show up in the “Broken” and “Redirects” lists, but are still checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. strike-through for broken links). Useful if you want to, for example, acknowledge that a link is broken and leave it be.
* Added a “Redirect URL” column. For redirects this will display the URL that the link redirects to. For normal, non-redirected links, it will be empty. This column is hidden by default. You can enable it in the “Screen Options” panel.
* Updated French translation.
* Tested on WP 3.4.1.
* Replace the “More plugins…” link on the “Broken Links” page with a link to the Admin Menu Editor page. This link will be hidden for users who have donated.

* The plugin’s tables are now created with the same character set and collation settings as native WP tables (previously they used the database defaults instead).
* Automatically clean up and optimize the plugin’s tables twice per month.
* Instead of displaying a zero response time for timed out links, now it shows how long the plugin waited before assuming that the link has timed out.

Subject: [SBA-ADV-20190913-02] CVE-2019-16521: WordPress Plugin - Broken Link
 Checker <= 1.11.8 - Reflected XSS

# WordPress Plugin - Broken Link Checker - Reflected XSS #

Link: <https://github.com/sbaresearch/advisories/tree/public/2019/SBA-ADV-20190913-02_WordPress_Plugin_Broken_Link_Checker>

## Vulnerability Overview ##

The broken-link-checker plugin through 1.11.8 for WordPress (aka Broken Link Checker)
is susceptible to Reflected XSS due to improper encoding and insertion of an HTTP GET
parameter into HTML. The filter function on the page listing all detected broken links
can be exploited by providing an XSS payload in the s_filter GET parameter in a
filter_id=search request.
NOTE: this is an end-of-life product.

* **Identifier**            : SBA-ADV-20190913-02

## Vendor Description ##

> This plugin will monitor your blog looking for broken links and let you know if any are found.

Active Installations: 700,000+

Source: <<https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/>>

## Impact ##

By exploiting the documented vulnerability, an external attacker without
any privileges can execute JavaScript code in a victim's browser.
This can be misused, e.g for phishing attacks by displaying a fake
login form and sending the victim's credentials to the attacker.
Furthermore malicious actions can be performed in the context of an authenticated
user. The impact depends on the level of access of the attacked user.
In case of an admin this can lead to the execution of PHP code and the compromise
of the server.

## Vulnerability Description ##

The filter function on the page listing all detected broken links can be exploited
by providing HTML and JavaScript code in one of the parameters.
All users with access to the "Broken Link Checker" are in danger.

This is possible because the CSS class of the table contains the value of the
`s_filter` GET parameter if it is not empty. Additionally it is necessary to provide
the special filter id "search" via parameter `filter_id=search` in order to reach this
execution path:

In `includes/link-query.php` (L803-810) the value of `$base_filter` is determined,
with `filter_id=search` the right path will be reached:

```php
$base_filter = '';
if ( array_key_exists($filter_id, $this->native_filters) ) {
    $base_filter = $filter_id;
} else if ( isset($current_filter['params']['s_filter']) && !empty($current_filter['params']['s_filter']) ) {
    $base_filter = $current_filter['params']['s_filter'];
} else if ( isset($_GET['s_filter']) && !empty($_GET['s_filter']) ) {
    $base_filter = $_GET['s_filter'];
}
```

In `admin/table-printer.php` (L71-82) the value of the CSS class of the table is determined and set.
Here the value of the GET parameter is inside `$current_filter['base_filter']`.

```php
$table_classes = array( 'widefat' );
if ( $compact ) {
    $table_classes[] = 'compact';
};
if ( $this->core->conf->options['table_color_code_status'] ) {
    $table_classes[] = 'color-code-link-status';
};
$table_classes[] = 'base-filter-' . $current_filter['base_filter'];
printf(
    '<table class="%s" id="blc-links"><thead><tr>',
    implode( ' ', $table_classes )
);
```

## Proof of Concept ##

This example shows how an attacker can craft a URL to execute a payload in the
browser of the victim. When a user clicks on the link and is logged-in, the payload
(in this case a simple JavaScript alert) will be executed. Otherwise the user will be taken
to the login page and redirected to the exploit after a successful login.
Replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE>` with the URL to your WordPress installation:

```text
<YOUR_DOMAIN_HERE>/wp-admin/tools.php?page=view-broken-links&filter_id=search&s_filter=%22+id%3D%22blc-links%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
```

## Recommended Countermeasures ##

We recommend to properly escape the output by using the encoding functions provided by WordPress,
like the `esc_*`- or `wp_kses_*`-[functions][1].
