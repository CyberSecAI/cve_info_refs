## Analysis of Security Content Regarding CVE-2019-16728

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16728:

### Relevant Content:

The content from `research.securitum.com` and `lists.debian.org` is relevant to CVE-2019-16728.

### Summary of Vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Mutation Cross-Site Scripting (mXSS) bypass in DOMPurify.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way browsers, specifically Chrome and Safari, mutate HTML when assigning it to the `innerHTML` property, particularly involving `<svg>` and `<math>` elements and their interaction with other tags like `<p>` and `<style>`.
*   **Weakness:**  The core weakness lies in the inconsistent parsing and re-parsing of HTML content by the browser when using `innerHTML`.  The browser's attempt to correct potentially invalid HTML can lead to unexpected mutations that introduce XSS vulnerabilities. DOMPurify's sanitization process is bypassed because the initial HTML is considered safe, but the mutated HTML contains active XSS.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a specific HTML payload, such as `<svg></p><style><a id="</style><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>">`.
    2.  This payload is initially sanitized by DOMPurify, which may not detect any malicious code because the `<img>` tag is within the `id` attribute of the `<a>` tag and inside the `<svg>` element.
    3.  The sanitized HTML is then assigned to the `innerHTML` of a DOM element.
    4.  The browser mutates the HTML, in particular the browser rewrites `<svg></p>` to `<svg><p></p></svg>` and then to `<svg></svg><p></p>`. This moves the `<img>` tag outside of the `<svg>` element and closes the `<style>` element, allowing the `onerror` attribute of the `<img>` tag to execute JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to XSS, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML into a web page that uses DOMPurify for sanitization. This could be through a comment field, a rich text editor, or any other input that allows HTML.
*   **Affected Browsers:** Chrome and Safari are specifically mentioned as being vulnerable to this mXSS behavior.
*   **Mitigation:** The recommended mitigation is to update DOMPurify to version 2.0.1 or later. If updating is not possible, the DOMPurify configuration should be altered to disallow both `<math>` and `<svg>` tags.

### Additional details
The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 2419-1) confirms that CVE-2019-16728 affects `dompurify.js` and provides a fix for Debian 9 "stretch". The advisory also mentions CVE-2020-26870, another related issue, and states that both are related to mXSS issues in SVG or MATH elements.
