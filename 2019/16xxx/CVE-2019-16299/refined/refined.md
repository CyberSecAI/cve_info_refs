        "lang": "en",
        "value": "The provided content discusses a vulnerability discovery tool called EVENTSCOPE, which identifies cross-plane event-based vulnerabilities in Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers. It specifically details a vulnerability (CVE-2019-16299) found in the ONOS SDN controller related to the host mobility app's lack of handling of certain HostEvent types."

  },
  "technical_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the host mobility app's failure to handle certain HostEvent types (HOST ADDED, HOST REMOVED, HOST UPDATED). This allows for malicious manipulation of the control plane by using crafted data plane inputs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing event handling",
       "Cross-plane vulnerability",
        "Improper data plane input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate network behavior by having the host mobility app fail to correctly remove flow rules, which can lead to a bypass of access control policies. For example, the attacker can cause the mobility app to remove access control app's flow deny rules, which results in unauthorized communication between hosts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted data plane packets",
      "ARP spoofing"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control at least one host connected to the network. In more complex scenarios, the attacker may need to control multiple hosts at different network locations. This includes the ability to send and receive network packets on the data plane.",
     "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the host mobility app does not handle  'HOST ADDED', 'HOST REMOVED' or 'HOST UPDATED' events. When these events occur, the mobility app fails to act on them (e.g., by removing old flow rules or cleaning up related resources). This can lead to inconsistent control plane behavior and data plane impacts such as bypassing access control policies."
