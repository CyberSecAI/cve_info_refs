CVE-2019-16903:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient path traversal protection in PltHttpServer.cpp, line 193. The code only checks for "/.." and "\.." but not "../" or "..\".
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Path traversal vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can access files outside the intended root directory of the media server.
  - Attack vectors: By crafting a GET request with a path containing "../" sequences.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to send a crafted GET request to the vulnerable server. The attacker needs to know the root directory of the media server to construct the malicious URL.
