The provided content describes five SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpIPAM.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `table` parameter when constructing SQL queries within the custom fields management functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `table` parameter in multiple files (`edit.php`, `edit-result.php`, `filter.php`, `filter-result.php`, and `order.php`).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive database information, as demonstrated by the `user()` function usage to obtain the database user.
- Denial of Service: By injecting `SLEEP()` functions, attackers can cause delays and potentially disrupt the application.
- Data Manipulation: Attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable files, manipulating the `table` parameter with SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- The attacker should have some knowledge of SQL to craft effective injection payloads.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the `edit.php`, `filter.php`, `filter-result.php` vulnerabilities but the `edit-result.php` and `order.php` seem to need valid `csrf_cookie` and `current` `next` parameters.

**Details provided beyond the CVE description:**
The content includes specific request/response pairs for each vulnerability.
- Vulnerability 1 uses `updatexml()` to extract information.
- Vulnerability 2 uses `sleep()` for time-based blind SQL injection.
- Vulnerabilities 3 & 4 use `updatexml()` to extract information.
- Vulnerability 5 uses `sleep()` for time-based blind SQL injection.
