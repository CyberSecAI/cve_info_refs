This release fixes a security issue described at

<https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-09-24/> .

Users should upgrade their nodes to this version immediately and discontinue use of older versions.

Please note that the issue does not put funds at risk of theft or counterfeiting.

The service period of this release is shorter than normal due to the upcoming

v2.1.0 Blossom release. The End-of-Service of v2.0.7-3 will occur at block height

653012, expected to be on 2019-12-10.

## Shrinking of debug.log files is temporarily disabled

In previous versions, `zcashd` would shrink the `debug.log` file to 200 KB on

startup if it was larger than 10 MB. This behaviour, and the `-shrinkdebugfile`

option that controlled it, has been disabled.

# Zcash Metadata Leakage CVE-2019-16930

![](/images/help-metadata-leakage.png)

TLDR:
A bug has existed for all shielded addresses since
the inception of [Zcash](https://z.cash) and Zcash Protocol. It is present in all Zcash source code
forks. It is possible to find the IP address of full nodes who own a shielded
address (zaddr). That is, Alice giving Bob a zaddr to be paid, could actually allow Bob
to discover Alice’s IP address. This is drastically against the design of Zcash Protocol.

[CVE-2019-16930](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16930) has been created to track this vulnerability.

PS: This isn’t related to the ITM or “Metaverse Metadata Attack”. That is still coming.

# Affected Parties

![](/images/glass-half-full.png)

All people who use zaddrs and who have shared zaddrs with 3rd parties. Such as:

* If you have given out your zaddr publicly on social media
* If you have given your zaddr in a bug report on Github/email/IRC/etc
* If you have ever given a zaddr to an exchange, mining pool or business
* If you have ever given a zaddr as Reply-To in a shielded memo

Consider your IP address and geo-location information associated with it as
tied to your zaddr. Yeah, this is not good. See `Mitigations` below.

# Unaffected Parties

If you have never used a zaddr, this does not affect you.

* If you have only sent funds to other zaddrs, but never received funds, you are safe
* If you use Tor/TAILS, then IP metadata leakage is not valuable information to the attacker

# Affected Cryptocoins

![](/images/fork-in-garbage-disposal.jpg)

A non-exhaustive list:

* Zcash (ZEC)
* Hush (HUSH)
* Pirate (ARRR)
* All Komodo (KMD) smart chains with zaddrs (enabled by default)
* Horizen (ZEN)
* Zero (ZER)
* VoteCoin (VOT)
* Snowgem (XSG)
* BitcoinZ (BTCZ)
* LitecoinZ (LTZ)
* Zelcash (ZEL)
* Ycash (YEC)
* Arrow (ARW)
* Verus (VRSC)
* BitcoinPrivate (BTCP)
* ZClassic (ZCL)
* Anon (ANON)

To clarify, while Bitcoin Gold (BTG) uses the Equihash Proof-of-Work from
Zcash, it is not a fork of Zcash source code and it does not use shielded
addresss and as such, is not affected.

Additional historical note: KMD previously had zaddrs but disabled that
feature, which has now migrated to the Pirate (ARRR) chain. KMD was vulnerable
to this in the past, but is no longer, since it no longer supports zaddrs.
Safecoin (SAFE) took a similar route, and has disable zaddrs, so they were
vulnerable in the past but no longer.

NOTE: The original version of this article was incorrect about SAFE, and the
author thanks SAFE devs for the correction.

# Mitigations

Firstly, the number one future-proof way to prevent this kind of “metadata leakage attack”
is to use Tor with your favorite cryptocoin via `-onlynet=onion` or even better, via TAILS,
which protects you at an even lower level, at the operating system networking layer.

Secondly, with no software updates, affected users can mitigate their risk from
publicly “burned” zaddrs. Users must create a brand new wallet.dat, with a
brand new zaddr, and then send all funds to that new address. If a user keeps
this new zaddr private, it is safe from this attack.

Zcash has released an emergency source code release (no binaries) [here](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v2.0.7-3).

and described (but not linked to) from this [announcement](https://z.cash/support/security/announcements/security-announcement-2019-09-24/).

Since most users need binaries, every Zcash user and every user of every Zcash
fork is vulnerable, even though we have a potential (not verified by 3rd paries)
code fix in Zcash Core.

If you do not want people who know your zaddr to know your IP address, I recommend
turning off full nodes until they are patched, and/or create fresh new wallets with
new zaddrs and discontinue using the old wallets until software updates are released.

Average users can probably stop reading here! Please be safe on the internets.

# Recommendations

If you run a mining pool which supports shielded addresses, do not provide a public
list of all workers and zaddrs! This severely removes privacy from your miners, due
to this current metadata leakage attacks and others. This was common in the past
but most mining pools have stopped the practice due to privacy issues.

Never give a zaddr in a bug report on Github! Many tools constantly vacuum potentially
sensitive data and OSINT from all public code repositories.

For heightened opsec, if you must give out zaddrs, you can isolate them to one single
wallet.dat, which is not normally used and stays off-line, while another wallet with
zaddrs can be used to send out funds. Since the sending wallet has never given a zaddr
out, this type of leakage is impossible for that node.

# Owning The Mistake

I personally apologize to the users of [Hush](https://myhush.org), who I feel responsible to protect.
My trust in the Zcash codebase has been shaken to it’s core and I now recommend
all Hush users to use Tor/TAILS to protect against future bugs like this coming
from Zcash upstream. This bug is fixed to the best of my knowledge in the master branch
of Hush and is in the [hushd 3.1.1 release](https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/releases/tag/v3.1.1).
Additionally, the commit fixing the issue was sent to Komodo and merged to their [dev branch as well](https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/1712).

I will note that this is still being actively researched and future fixes may be released related to this issue.
To learn more about mitigating against this and protecting yourself, if you are a Hush user or another coin,
you are welcome to join [Hush Discord](https://myhush.org/discord/) and ask for help.

# Deep Dive

This bug was introduced in the original codebase and Zcash has been vulnerable to
this attack it’s entire history, since the
[commit](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/commit/369df065836525fd880107a9f5b5c9bc2aa0f890)
that introduced it was written in 2016:

```
commit 369df065836525fd880107a9f5b5c9bc2aa0f890
Author: Sean Bowe <[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)>
Date:   Wed May 4 17:25:42 2016

    Introduce new `libzcash` Zcash protocol API and crypto constructions surrounding the zkSNARK circuit.

```

That commit added the code to the older Sprout shielded addresses and the code was
copied almost exactly for the newer Sapling shielded addresses.

This bug is in the P2P layer of Zcash, inherited from Bitcoin, where nodes
exchange data with their peers.

# Explanation Of The Attack

* Attacker node relays an invalid transaction to the mempool of its peers
* This transaction has an invalid serialization of the encrypted memo field
* Nodes without the private key and with no viewing key of that shielded address react normally to this invalid transaction
* Nodes that have the private key (or viewkey, most likely) will generate a C++ exception
* This C++ exception causes different network behavior that perfectly fingerprint the nodes
* No record of this attack appears on the blockchain or explorers

The commit fixing the attack is [here](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/commit/c1fbf8ab5d73cff5e1f45236995857c75ba4128d).

The core of the diff is just a few lines:

```
-    CDataStream ss(SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION);
-    ss << pt.get();
-
     SaplingNotePlaintext ret;
-    ss >> ret;
+    try {
+        CDataStream ss(SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION);
+        ss << pt.get();
+        ss >> ret;
+        assert(ss.size() == 0);
+    } catch (const boost::thread_interrupted&) {
+        throw;
+    } catch (...) {
+        return boost::none;
+    }

```

This line not having a try/catch is the core reason for the bug existing:

```
    ss << pt.get();

```

Since `pt` is attacker-controlled data being written into a local `CDataStream
ss` object, it needs more careful handling.

One can see now that only exceptions of the type `boost::thread_interrupted` are bubbled up now,
and all other exceptions are “eaten” and `boost::none` is returned. This makes nodes which
have the private key of a zaddr act like all others, preventing the metadata leakage.

The author notes that there still exists vulnerable-looking code for older Sprout addresses
[here](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/c1fbf8ab5d73cff5e1f45236995857c75ba4128d/src/zcash/Note.cpp#L124).

One may think that this attack can only be done against a node’s peers, not against the whole network,
but it’s trivial to increase the maximum peer count and so to study the entire network with one or a few
nodes is completely viable.

An advanced attacker will have a database of zaddrs they want to link to IPs, will run nodes that densely
connect to the entire network and periodically send out out invalid transactions to the mempool of all
peers, building a history of (timestamp, zaddr, IP address) triplets of data. This data can then be used
and linked to other data via amount analysis and timing analsysis to completely de-anonymize shielded
transactions and tie them directly to IP addresses and geographical locations.
