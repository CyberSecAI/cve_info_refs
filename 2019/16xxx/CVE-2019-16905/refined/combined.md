# SSD Advisory – OpenSSH Pre-Auth XMSS Integer Overflow

* [August 28, 2019](https://ssd-disclosure.com/2019/08/28/)
* [SSD Secure Disclosure technical team](https://ssd-disclosure.com/author/ssd-secure-disclosure-technical-team/)
* [Vulnerability publication](https://ssd-disclosure.com/category/vulnerability-publication/)

**Vulnerability Summary**
The following advisory describes a Pre-Auth Integer Overflow in the XMSS Key Parsing Algorithm in OpenSSH.
**CVE**
CVE-2019-16905
**Credit**
An independent Security Researcher, Adam “pi3” Zabrocki, has reported this vulnerability to SSD Secure Disclosure program.
**Affected Systems**
OpenSSH version 7.7 up to the latest one (8.0) supporting XMSS keys (compiled with a defined WITH\_XMSS macro).
Nevertheless, the bug is only there when OpenSSH is compiled via a compiler with data model ILP64, LLP64 or ILP32 (e.g. any 32 bits systems).
**Vendor Response**
[The vulnerability was fixed in OpenSSH version 8.1](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html)
**Vulnerability Details**

##### OpenSSH

OpenSSH is a free version of the SSH connectivity tools which technical users of the Internet rely on. Users of telnet, rlogin, and ftp may not realize that their password is transmitted across the Internet unencrypted, but in fact it is.
OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. Additionally, OpenSSH provides secure tunneling capabilities and several authentication methods, and supports all SSH protocol versions.
OpenSSH supports several signing algorithms (for authentication keys) which can be divided in two groups depending on the mathematical properties they exploit:

* DSA and RSA, which rely on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers
* ECDSA and Ed25519, which rely on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem

Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithms are a more recent addition to public key cryptosystems. One of their main advantages is their ability to provide the same level of security with smaller keys, which makes for less computationally intensive operations (i.e. faster key creation, encryption and decryption) and reduced storage and transmission requirements.
OpenSSH 7.7 add experimental support for PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography) XMSS keys (Extended Hash-Based Signatures) is designed to work in Post Quantum area. The code is not compiled in by default at this time.

##### XMSS

The eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) is the latest stateful hash-based signature scheme. It has the smallest signatures out of such schemes and comes with a multi-tree variant that solves the problem of slow key generation.
Moreover, it can be shown that XMSS is secure, making only mild assumptions on the underlying hash function. Especially, it is not required that the cryptographic hash function is collision-resistant for the security of XMSS.
In contrast to traditional signature schemes, the signature schemes used in XMSS are stateful, meaning the secret key changes over time. If a secret key state is used twice, no cryptographic security guarantees remain. In consequence, it becomes feasible to forge a signature on a new message.

##### The Vulnerability

Integer Overflow vulnerability causing a memory corruption bug was found during process of parsing XMSS private key. This process requires taking into account previously saved “state”, if available. A function responsible for handling XMSS saved “states” is prone to a memory corruption via integer overflow vulnerability:

```
int
sshkey_xmss_decrypt_state(const struct sshkey *k, struct sshbuf *encoded,
   struct sshbuf **retp)
{
...
    struct sshbuf *copy = NULL, *decrypted = NULL;
...
    size_t keylen, ivlen, authlen, aadlen;
    u_int blocksize, encrypted_len, index;
...
    blocksize = cipher_blocksize(cipher);
    keylen = cipher_keylen(cipher);
    ivlen = cipher_ivlen(cipher);
    authlen = cipher_authlen(cipher);
...
    if ((copy = sshbuf_fromb(encoded)) == NULL ||
        (decrypted = sshbuf_new()) == NULL ||
        (iv = malloc(ivlen)) == NULL) {
        r = SSH_ERR_ALLOC_FAIL;
        goto out;
    }
...
    if (sshbuf_len(encoded) < sizeof(XMSS_MAGIC) ||
...
    if ((r = sshbuf_consume(encoded, sizeof(XMSS_MAGIC))) != 0 ||
        (r = sshbuf_get_u32(encoded, &index)) != 0 ||
        (r = sshbuf_get_u32(encoded, &encrypted_len)) != 0)
        goto out;
...
    /* check size of encrypted key blob */
    if (encrypted_len < blocksize || (encrypted_len % blocksize) != 0) {
        r = SSH_ERR_INVALID_FORMAT;
        goto out;
    }
    /* check that an appropriate amount of auth data is present */
[1] if (sshbuf_len(encoded) < encrypted_len + authlen) {
        r = SSH_ERR_INVALID_FORMAT;
        goto out;
    }
    aadlen = sshbuf_len(copy) - sshbuf_len(encoded);
...
    /* decrypt private state of key */
[2] if ((r = sshbuf_reserve(decrypted, aadlen + encrypted_len, &dp)) != 0 ||
        (r = cipher_init(&ciphercontext, cipher, key, keylen,
        iv, ivlen, 0)) != 0 ||
[3]     (r = cipher_crypt(ciphercontext, 0, dp, sshbuf_ptr(copy),
        encrypted_len, aadlen, authlen)) != 0)
        goto out;
    /* there should be no trailing data */
    if ((r = sshbuf_consume(encoded, encrypted_len + authlen)) != 0)
        goto out;
    if (sshbuf_len(encoded) != 0) {
        r = SSH_ERR_INVALID_FORMAT;
        goto out;
    }
    /* remove AAD */
    if ((r = sshbuf_consume(decrypted, aadlen)) != 0)
        goto out;
...
}

```

If an attacker generates a state where ‘aadlen’ + ‘encrypted\_len’ is bigger than INT\_MAX, then it is possible to successfully pass verification at [1].
Additionally, if ‘authlen’ + ‘encrypted\_len’ is also bigger than INT\_MAX, then an integer overflow at [2] results in allocating a smaller buffer than desired.
Immediate overflow can happen at [3] where cipher\_crypt() is called. This function operates as follows:

* Copy ‘aadlen’ bytes (without en/decryption) from ‘src’ to ‘dest’.
* Theses bytes are treated as additional authenticated data for authenticated encryption modes.
* En/Decrypt ‘len’ bytes at offset ‘aadlen’ from ‘src’ to ‘dest’.
* Use ‘authlen’ bytes at offset ‘len’+’aadlen’ as the authentication tag.
* This tag is written on encryption and verified on decryption.

Because of the nature of cipher\_crypt() function, it is possible to overflow a lot of useful data before a crash, because ‘copy’ is not being done in a 1 single shot but chunk-by-chunk during crypto operation. Nevertheless, it is not a trivial task.

##### Vectors of Attack

Any OpenSSH functionality which can parse private XMSS key is vulnerable. E.g. If ‘sshd’ daemon is configured to use an XMSS host key that is malformed, it will crash upon any attempt to connect to this server:

```

```

If someone configures ‘authorized\_key’ to use XMSS public key and keep private key to be able to connect to the server, ‘ssh’ client will crash:

```
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ ./ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_xmss 127.0.0.1 -p 65535 -oHostKeyAlgorithms="ssh-xmss@openssh.com" -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes="ssh-xmss@openssh.com" -l test
verify:: idx = 20
Segmentation fault
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$

```

If someone tries to add this key to ssh-agent, it will crash too:

```
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ rm -rf ~/.ssh/*
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ ./ssh-agent
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-VEgZcFmzWZ2o/agent.8927; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
SSH_AGENT_PID=8928; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
echo Agent pid 8928;
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-VEgZcFmzWZ2o/agent.8927; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ SSH_AGENT_PID=8928; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ ./ssh-add -M 2
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ cp ~/p_key_bug/* ~/.ssh/
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$ ./ssh-add -M 2
Segmentation fault
pi3@ubuntu:~/orig/openssh-8.0p1$

```

From the real world cases, many hosting services allow the user to upload user’s own pair of private/public keys for the authentication. Then it can be automatically consumed when creating new VMs. They need to parse it so an attacker can upload a malicious key and cause vulnerability during parsing process. Examples include Azure Key Vault, Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) or Cloud Key Management Service by Google Cloud. Any Key management service might be a vector of the attack.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this
has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

OpenSSH: Release Notes

## [*Open***SSH**](/) Release Notes

---

### [OpenSSH 9.9](txt/release-9.9)/[9.9p1](txt/release-9.9) (2024-09-19)

```

OpenSSH 9.9 was released on 2024-09-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

OpenSSH plans to remove support for the DSA signature algorithm in
early 2025. This release disables DSA by default at compile time.

DSA, as specified in the SSHv2 protocol, is inherently weak - being
limited to a 160 bit private key and use of the SHA1 digest. Its
estimated security level is only 80 bits symmetric equivalent.

OpenSSH has disabled DSA keys by default since 2015 but has retained
run-time optional support for them. DSA was the only mandatory-to-
implement algorithm in the SSHv2 RFCs, mostly because alternative
algorithms were encumbered by patents when the SSHv2 protocol was
specified.

This has not been the case for decades at this point and better
algorithms are well supported by all actively-maintained SSH
implementations. We do not consider the costs of maintaining DSA
in OpenSSH to be justified and hope that removing it from OpenSSH
can accelerate its wider deprecation in supporting cryptography
libraries.

Currently DSA is disabled at compile time. The final step of
removing DSA support entirely is planned for the first OpenSSH
release of 2025.

DSA support may be re-enabled on OpenBSD by setting "DSAKEY=yes"
in Makefile.inc. To enable DSA support in portable OpenSSH, pass
the "--enable-dsa-keys" option to configure.

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): remove support for pre-authentication compression.
   OpenSSH has only supported post-authentication compression in
   the server for some years. Compression before authentication
   significantly increases the attack surface of SSH servers and risks
   creating oracles that reveal information about information sent
   during authentication.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): processing of the arguments to the "Match"
   configuration directive now follows more shell-like rules for
   quoted strings, including allowing nested quotes and \-escaped
   characters. If configurations contained workarounds for the
   previous simplistic quote handling then they may need to be
   adjusted. If this is the case, it's most likely to be in the
   arguments to a "Match exec" confition. In this case, moving the
   command to be evaluated from the Match line to an external shell
   script is easiest way to preserve compatibility with both the old
   and new versions.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.8
=========================

This release contains a number of new features and bugfixes.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add support for a new hybrid post-quantum key
   exchange based on the FIPS 203 Module-Lattice Key Enapsulation
   mechanism (ML-KEM) combined with X25519 ECDH as described by
   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke-03>
   This algorithm "mlkem768x25519-sha256" is available by default.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): the ssh_config "Include" directive can now expand
   environment as well as the same set of %-tokens "Match Exec"
   supports.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a sshd_config "RefuseConnection" option that, if set
   will terminate the connection at the first authentication request.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a "refuseconnection" penalty class to sshd_config
   PerSourcePenalties that is applied when a connection is dropped by
   the new RefuseConnection keyword.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a "Match invalid-user" predicate to sshd_config Match
   options that matches when the target username is not valid on the
   server.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): update the Streamlined NTRUPrime code to a
   substantially faster implementation.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the hybrid Streamlined NTRUPrime/X25519 key
   exchange algorithm now has an IANA-assigned name in addition to
   the "@openssh.com" vendor extension name. This algorithm is now
   also available under this name "sntrup761x25519-sha512"

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): prevent private keys from being
   included in core dump files for most of their lifespans. This is
   in addition to pre-existing controls in [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)
   that prevented coredumps. This feature is supported on OpenBSD,
   Linux and FreeBSD.

 * All: convert key handling to use the libcrypto EVP_PKEY API, with
   the exception of DSA.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a random amount of jitter (up to 4 seconds) to the
   grace login time to make its expiry unpredictable.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): relax absolute path requirement back to what it was prior
   to OpenSSH 9.8, which incorrectly required that sshd was started
   with an absolute path in inetd mode. [bz3717](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3717)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix regression introduced in openssh-9.8 that swapped the
   order of source and destination addresses in some sshd log messages.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): do not apply authorized_keys options when signature
   verification fails. Prevents more restrictive key options being
   incorrectly applied to subsequent keys in authorized_keys. [bz3733](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3733)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): include pathname in some of ssh-keygen's passphrase
   prompts. Helps the user know what's going on when ssh-keygen is
   invoked via other tools. Requested in [GHPR503](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/503)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): make parsing user@host consistently look for
   the last '@' in the string rather than the first. This makes it
   possible to more consistently use usernames that contain '@'
   characters.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): be more strict in parsing key type names. Only
   allow short names (e.g "rsa") in user-interface code and require
   full SSH protocol names (e.g. "ssh-rsa") everywhere else. [bz3725](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3725)

 * regress: many performance and correctness improvements to the
   re-keying regression test.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): clarify that ed25519 is the default key type
   generated and clarify that rsa-sha2-512 is the default signature
   scheme when RSA is in use. [GHPR505](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/505)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix minor memory leak in Subsystem option parsing; [GHPR515](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/515)

 * All: additional hardening and consistency checks for the sshbuf
   code.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): reduce default logingrace penalty to ensure that a single
   forgotton login that times out will be below the penalty threshold.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix proxy multiplexing (-O proxy) bug. If a mux started with
   ControlPersist then later has a forwarding added using mux proxy
   connection and the forwarding was used, then when the mux proxy
   session terminated, the mux master process would issue a bad message
   that terminated the connection.

Portability
-----------

 * sync contrib/ssh-copy-id to the latest upstream version.

 * regress: improve portablility for some awk(1) usage (e.g. Solaris)

 * In the contrib/redhat RPM spec file, without_openssl was previously
   incorrectly enabled unconditionally.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) restore audit call before exit that regressed in openssh-9.8
   Fixes an issue where the SSH_CONNECTION_ABANDON event was not
   recorded.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add support for class-imposed loging restrictions on FreeBSD.
   Allowing auth_hostok(3) and auth_timeok(3) to control logins.

 * Build fixes for Musl libc.

 * Fix detection of setres*id on GNU/Hurd

### [OpenSSH 9.8](txt/release-9.8)/[9.8p1](txt/release-9.8) (2024-07-01)

```

OpenSSH 9.8 was released on 2024-07-01. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the

Security
========

This release contains fixes for two security problems, one critical
and one minor.

1) Race condition in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)

A critical vulnerability in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) was present in Portable OpenSSH
versions between 8.5p1 and 9.7p1 (inclusive) that may allow arbitrary
code execution with root privileges.

Successful exploitation has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc
systems with ASLR. Under lab conditions, the attack requires on
average 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the
server will accept. Exploitation on 64-bit systems is believed to be
possible but has not been demonstrated at this time. It's likely that
these attacks will be improved upon.

Exploitation on non-glibc systems is conceivable but has not been
examined. Systems that lack ASLR or users of downstream Linux
distributions that have modified OpenSSH to disable per-connection
ASLR re-randomisation (yes - this is a thing, no - we don't
understand why) may potentially have an easier path to exploitation.
OpenBSD is not vulnerable.

We thank the Qualys Security Advisory Team for discovering, reporting
and demonstrating exploitability of this problem, and for providing
detailed feedback on additional mitigation measures.

2) Logic error in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ObscureKeystrokeTiming

In OpenSSH version 9.5 through 9.7 (inclusive), when connected to an
OpenSSH server version 9.5 or later, a logic error in the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
ObscureKeystrokeTiming feature (on by default) rendered this feature
ineffective - a passive observer could still detect which network
packets contained real keystrokes when the countermeasure was active
because both fake and real keystroke packets were being sent
unconditionally.

This bug was found by Philippos Giavridis and also independently by
Jacky Wei En Kung, Daniel Hugenroth and Alastair Beresford of the
University of Cambridge Computer Lab.

Worse, the unconditional sending of both fake and real keystroke
packets broke another long-standing timing attack mitigation. Since
OpenSSH 2.9.9 [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) has sent fake keystoke echo packets for
traffic received on TTYs in echo-off mode, such as when entering a
password into su(8) or sudo(8). This bug rendered these fake
keystroke echoes ineffective and could allow a passive observer of
a SSH session to once again detect when echo was off and obtain
fairly limited timing information about keystrokes in this situation
(20ms granularity by default).

This additional implication of the bug was identified by Jacky Wei
En Kung, Daniel Hugenroth and Alastair Beresford and we thank them
for their detailed analysis.

This bug does not affect connections when ObscureKeystrokeTiming
was disabled or sessions where no TTY was requested.

Future deprecation notice
=========================

OpenSSH plans to remove support for the DSA signature algorithm in
early 2025. This release disables DSA by default at compile time.

DSA, as specified in the SSHv2 protocol, is inherently weak - being
limited to a 160 bit private key and use of the SHA1 digest. Its
estimated security level is only 80 bits symmetric equivalent.

OpenSSH has disabled DSA keys by default since 2015 but has retained
run-time optional support for them. DSA was the only mandatory-to-
implement algorithm in the SSHv2 RFCs, mostly because alternative
algorithms were encumbered by patents when the SSHv2 protocol was
specified.

This has not been the case for decades at this point and better
algorithms are well supported by all actively-maintained SSH
implementations. We do not consider the costs of maintaining DSA
in OpenSSH to be justified and hope that removing it from OpenSSH
can accelerate its wider deprecation in supporting cryptography
libraries.

This release, and its deactivation of DSA by default at compile-time,
marks the second step in our timeline to finally deprecate DSA. The
final step of removing DSA support entirely is planned for the first
OpenSSH release of 2025.

DSA support may be re-enabled in OpenBSD by setting "DSAKEY=yes"
in Makefile.inc. To enable DSA support in portable OpenSSH, pass
the "--enable-dsa-keys" option to configure.

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * all: as mentioned above, the DSA signature algorithm is now
   disabled at compile time.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the server will now block client addresses that
   repeatedly fail authentication, repeatedly connect without ever
   completing authentication or that crash the server. See the
   discussion of PerSourcePenalties below for more information.
   Operators of servers that accept connections from many users, or
   servers that accept connections from addresses behind NAT or
   proxies may need to consider these settings.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the server has been split into a listener binary, [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8),
   and a per-session binary "sshd-session". This allows for a much
   smaller listener binary, as it no longer needs to support the SSH
   protocol. As part of this work, support for disabling privilege
   separation (which previously required code changes to disable) and
   disabling re-execution of [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) has been removed. Further
   separation of sshd-session into additional, minimal binaries is
   planned for the future.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): several log messages have changed. In particular, some
   log messages will be tagged with as originating from a process
   named "sshd-session" rather than "sshd".

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): this tool previously emitted comment lines
   containing the hostname and SSH protocol banner to standard error.
   This release now emits them to standard output, but adds a new
   "-q" flag to silence them altogether.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): (portable OpenSSH only) sshd will no longer use argv[0]
   as the PAM service name. A new "PAMServiceName" [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)
   directive allows selecting the service name at runtime. This
   defaults to "sshd". [bz2101](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2101)

 * (portable OpenSSH only) Automatically-generated files, such as
   configure, config.h.in, etc will now be checked in to the portable
   OpenSSH git release branch (e.g. V_9_8). This should ensure that
   the contents of the signed release branch exactly match the
   contents of the signed release tarball.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.7
=========================

This release contains mostly bugfixes.

New features
------------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): as described above, [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will now penalise client
   addresses that, for various reasons, do not successfully complete
   authentication. This feature is controlled by a new [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)
   PerSourcePenalties option and is on by default.

   [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will now identify situations where the session did not
   authenticate as expected. These conditions include when the client
   repeatedly attempted authentication unsucessfully (possibly
   indicating an attack against one or more accounts, e.g. password
   guessing), or when client behaviour caused sshd to crash (possibly
   indicating attempts to exploit bugs in sshd).

   When such a condition is observed, sshd will record a penalty of
   some duration (e.g. 30 seconds) against the client's address. If
   this time is above a minimum configurable threshold, then all
   connections from the client address will be refused (along with any
   others in the same PerSourceNetBlockSize CIDR range) until the
   penalty expire.

   Repeated offenses by the same client address will accrue greater
   penalties, up to a configurable maximum. Address ranges may be
   fully exempted from penalties, e.g. to guarantee access from a set
   of trusted management addresses, using the new [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)
   PerSourcePenaltyExemptList option.

   We hope these options will make it significantly more difficult for
   attackers to find accounts with weak/guessable passwords or exploit
   bugs in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) itself. This option is enabled by default.

 * [ssh(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.8): allow the HostkeyAlgorithms directive to disable the
   implicit fallback from certificate host key to plain host keys.

Bugfixes
--------

 * misc: fix a number of inaccuracies in the PROTOCOL.*
   documentation files. [GHPR430](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/430) [GHPR487](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/487)

 * all: switch to strtonum(3) for more robust integer parsing in most
   places.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): correctly restore sigprocmask around ppoll()

 * [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8): stricter validation of messaging socket fd [GHPR492](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/492)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): flush stdout after writing "sftp>" prompt when not using
   editline. [GHPR480](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/480)

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): fix home-directory extension implementation, it
   previously always returned the current user's home directory
   contrary to the spec. [GHPR477](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/477)

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): do not close stdin to prevent error messages when

   [bz3701](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3701).

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): expose SSH_AUTH_INFO_0 always to PAM auth modules
   unconditionally. The previous behaviour was to expose it only when
   particular authentication methods were in use.

   reload, using a standalone implementation that doesn't depend on
   libsystemd. [bz2641](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2641)

### [OpenSSH 9.7](txt/release-9.7)/[9.7p1](txt/release-9.7) (2024-03-11)

```

OpenSSH 9.7 was released on 2024-03-11. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:

Future deprecation notice
=========================

OpenSSH plans to remove support for the DSA signature algorithm in
early 2025 and compile-time disable it later this year.

DSA, as specified in the SSHv2 protocol, is inherently weak - being
limited to a 160 bit private key and use of the SHA1 digest. Its
estimated security level is only 80 bits symmetric equivalent.

OpenSSH has disabled DSA keys by default since 2015 but has retained
run-time optional support for them. DSA was the only mandatory-to-
implement algorithm in the SSHv2 RFCs[3], mostly because alternative
algorithms were encumbered by patents when the SSHv2 protocol was
specified.

This has not been the case for decades at this point and better
algorithms are well supported by all actively-maintained SSH
implementations. We do not consider the costs of maintaining DSA in
OpenSSH to be justified and hope that removing it from OpenSSH can
accelerate its wider deprecation in supporting cryptography
libraries.

This release makes DSA support in OpenSSH compile-time optional,
defaulting to on. We intend the next release to change the default
to disable DSA at compile time. The first OpenSSH release of 2025
will remove DSA support entirely.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.6
=========================

This release contains mostly bugfixes.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a "global" ChannelTimeout type that watches
   all open channels and will close all open channels if there is no
   traffic on any of them for the specified interval. This is in
   addition to the existing per-channel timeouts added recently.

   This supports situations like having both session and x11
   forwarding channels open where one may be idle for an extended
   period but the other is actively used. The global timeout could
   close both channels when both have been idle for too long.

 * All: make DSA key support compile-time optional, defaulting to on.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): don't append an unnecessary space to the end of subsystem
   arguments ([bz3667](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3667))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix the multiplexing "channel proxy" mode, broken when
   keystroke timing obfuscation was added. ([GHPR#463](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/463))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix spurious configuration parsing errors when
   options that accept array arguments are overridden ([bz3657](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3657)).

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): fix potential spin in signal handler ([bz3670](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3670))

 * Many fixes to manual pages and other documentation, including
   [GHPR#462](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/462), [GHPR#454](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/454), [GHPR#442](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/442) and [GHPR#441](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/441).

 * Greatly improve interop testing against PuTTY.

Portability
-----------

 * Improve the error message when the autoconf OpenSSL header check
   fails ([bz#3668](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3668))

 * Improve detection of broken toolchain -fzero-call-used-regs support
   ([bz3645](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3645)).

 * Fix regress/misc/fuzz-harness fuzzers and make them compile without
   warnings when using clang16

### [OpenSSH 9.6](txt/release-9.6)/[9.6p1](txt/release-9.6) (2023-12-18)

```

OpenSSH 9.6 was released on 2023-12-18. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.5
=========================

This release contains a number of security fixes, some small features
and bugfixes.

Security
========

This release contains fixes for a newly-discovered weakness in the
SSH transport protocol, a logic error relating to constrained PKCS#11
keys in [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) and countermeasures for programs that invoke
[ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) with user or hostnames containing invalid characters.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the
   so-called "Terrapin attack" discovered by Fabian BÃ¤umer, Marcus
   Brinkmann and JÃ¶rg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a
   limited break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport
   protocol by sending extra messages prior to the commencement of
   encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages
   immediately after encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server
   would not be able to detect that messages were deleted.

   While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
   is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
   consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
   the protocol prevents user user authentication from proceeding and
   results in a stuck connection.

   The most serious identified impact is that it lets a MITM to
   delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
   starts, allowing the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke
   timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5. There is no
   other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity.

   OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this protocol weakness through a new "strict
   KEX" protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when
   both the client and server support it. This extension makes
   two changes to the SSH transport protocol to improve the integrity
   of the initial key exchange.

   Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the connection if any
   unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange
   (including messages that were previously legal but not strictly
   required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability from
   the early protocol.

   Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the
   conclusion of each key exchange, preventing previously inserted
   messages from being able to make persistent changes to the
   sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of
   these changes should be sufficient to thwart the Terrapin Attack.

   More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the
   OpenSSH source distribition.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while
   specifying destination constraints, if the PKCS#11 token returned
   multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied.
   Use of regular private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys
   are unaffected.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
   metacharacters was passed to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), and a ProxyCommand,
   LocalCommand directive or "match exec" predicate referenced the
   user or hostname via %u, %h or similar expansion token, then
   an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
   could potentially perform command injection depending on what
   quoting was present in the user-supplied [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) directive.

   This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where
   a repository could contain a submodule with shell characters in
   its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell metacharacters in user
   or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted
   sources.

   Although we believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure
   validity of arguments passed to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), especially across a
   security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now
   bans most shell metacharacters from user and hostnames supplied
   via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
   effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to
   universally filter shell metacharacters potentially relevant to
   user-supplied commands.

   User/hostnames provided via [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) are not subject to these
   restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to
   continue to be used, under the assumption that the user knows what
   they are doing in their own configuration files.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the [RFC4254](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254) connection/channels protocol provides
   a TCP-like window mechanism that limits the amount of data that
   can be sent without acceptance from the peer. In cases where this
   limit was exceeded by a non-conforming peer SSH implementation,
   [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) previously discarded the extra data. From OpenSSH
   9.6, [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will now terminate the connection if a peer
   exceeds the window limit by more than a small grace factor. This
   change should have no effect of SSH implementations that follow
   the specification.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a %j token that expands to the configured ProxyJump
   hostname (or the empty string if this option is not being used)
   that can be used in a number of [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) keywords. [bz3610](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3610)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add ChannelTimeout support to the client, mirroring the
   same option in the server and allowing [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to terminate
   quiescent channels.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add support for
   reading ED25519 private keys in PEM PKCS8 format. Previously
   only the OpenSSH private key format was supported.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): introduce a protocol extension to allow
   renegotiation of acceptable signature algorithms for public key
   authentication after the server has learned the username being
   used for authentication. This allows varying [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)
   PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms in a "Match user" block.

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): add an agent protocol extension to allow
   specifying certificates when loading PKCS#11 keys. This allows the
   use of certificates backed by PKCS#11 private keys in all OpenSSH
   tools that support [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1). Previously only [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) supported
   this use-case.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when deciding whether to enable the keystroke timing
   obfuscation, enable it only if a channel with a TTY is active.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): switch mainloop from poll(3) to ppoll(3) and mask signals
   before checking flags set in signal handler. Avoids potential
   race condition between signaling ssh to exit and polling. [bz3531](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3531)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when connecting to a destination with both the
   AddressFamily and CanonicalizeHostname directives in use,
   the AddressFamily directive could be ignored. [bz5326](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5326)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): correct handling of the limits@openssh.com option when
   the server returned an unexpected message.

 * A number of fixes to the PuTTY and Dropbear regress/integration
   tests.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): release GSS OIDs only at end of authentication, avoiding
   unnecessary init/cleanup cycles. [bz2982](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2982)

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5): mention "none" is a valid argument to IdentityFile
   in the manual. [bz3080](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3080)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): improved debugging for paths from the server rejected for
   not matching the client's glob(3) pattern in old SCP/RCP protocol
   mode.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): refuse signing operations on destination-constrained
   keys if a previous session-bind operation has failed. This may
   prevent a fail-open situation in future if a user uses a mismatched
   [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) client and [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) where the client supports a key type
   that the agent does not support.

Portability
-----------

 * Better identify unsupported and unstable compiler flags, such as
   -fzero-call-used-regs which has been unstable across a several
   clang releases.

 * A number of fixes to regression test reliability and log
   collection.

 * Update the OpenSSL dependency in the RPM specification.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): for OpenSolaris systems that support privilege limitation
   via the getpflags() interface, prefer using the newer PRIV_XPOLICY
   to PRIV_LIMIT. [bz2833](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2833)

### [OpenSSH 9.5](txt/release-9.5)/[9.5p1](txt/release-9.5) (2023-10-04)

```

OpenSSH 9.5 was released on 2023-10-04. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.4
=========================

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some small features.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys
   are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are
   specified in [RFC 8709](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8709) and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5
   (January 2014).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of
   subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic
   configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration
   (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts
   to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at
   fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small
   amount of data being sent. It also sends fake "chaff" keystrokes for
   a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
   controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds
   a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to
   implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the "local
   extensions" number space and are advertised using a "ping@openssh.com"
   ext-info message with a string version number of "0".

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow override of Subsystem directives in sshd Match blocks.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of
   directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode,
   the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not. [bz3611](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3611)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in
   sshsig signature files.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they
   originally requested a tty.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s)
   and don't delay at all for the "none" authentication mechanism.cw
    [bz3602](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3602)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level
   verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those
   get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal().

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes
    to be sent less frequently than configured.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix regression in OpenSSH 9.4 (mux.c r1.99) that caused
   multiplexed sessions to ignore SIGINT under some circumstances.

Portability
-----------

 * Avoid clang zero-call-used-regs=all bug on Apple compilers, which
   for some reason have version numbers that do not match the upstream
   clang version numbers. [bz#3584](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3584)

 * Fix configure test for zlib 1.3 and later/development versions. [bz3604](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3604)

### [OpenSSH 9.4](txt/release-9.4)/[9.4p1](txt/release-9.4) (2023-08-10)

```

OpenSSH 9.4 was released on 2023-08-10. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 9.3p2
===========================

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some small features.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * This release removes support for older versions of libcrypto.
   OpenSSH now requires LibreSSL >= 3.1.0 or OpenSSL >= 1.1.1.
   Note that these versions are already deprecated by their upstream
   vendors.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): PKCS#11 modules must now be specified by their full
   paths. Previously dlopen(3) could search for them in system
   library directories.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow forwarding Unix Domain sockets via ssh -W.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add support for configuration tags to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1).
   This adds a [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) "Tag" directive and corresponding
   "Match tag" predicate that may be used to select blocks of
   configuration similar to the pf.conf(5) keywords of the same
   name.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a "match localnetwork" predicate. This allows matching
   on the addresses of available network interfaces and may be used to
   vary the effective client configuration based on network location.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): infrastructure support for KRL
   extensions.  This defines wire formats for optional KRL extensions
   and implements parsing of the new submessages. No actual extensions
   are supported at this point.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand and AuthorizedKeysCommand now
   accept two additional %-expansion sequences: %D which expands to
   the routing domain of the connected session and %C which expands
   to the addresses and port numbers for the source and destination
   of the connection.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): increase the default work factor (rounds) for the
   bcrypt KDF used to derive symmetric encryption keys for passphrase
   protected key files by 50%.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): improve isolation between loaded PKCS#11 modules
   by running separate ssh-pkcs11-helpers for each loaded provider.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): make -f (fork after authentication) work correctly with
   multiplexed connections, including ControlPersist. [bz3589](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3589) [bz3589](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3589)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): make ConnectTimeout apply to multiplexing sockets and not
   just to network connections.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): improve defences against invalid PKCS#11
   modules being loaded by checking that the requested module
   contains the required symbol before loading it.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand when AuthorizedKeysCommand
   appears before it in sshd_config. Since OpenSSH 8.7 the
   AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand directive was incorrectly ignored in
   this situation. [bz3574](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3574)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): remove vestigal support for KRL
   signatures When the KRL format was originally defined, it included
   support for signing of KRL objects. However, the code to sign KRLs
   and verify KRL signatues was never completed in OpenSSH. This
   release removes the partially-implemented code to verify KRLs.
   All OpenSSH tools now ignore KRL_SECTION_SIGNATURE sections in
   KRL files.

 * All: fix a number of memory leaks and unreachable/harmless integer
   overflows.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): don't truncate strings logged from PKCS#11
   modules; [GHPR406](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/406)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): better validate CASignatureAlgorithms in
   ssh_config and sshd_config. Previously this directive would accept
   certificate algorithm names, but these were unusable in practice as
   OpenSSH does not support CA chains. [bz3577](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3577)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): make `ssh -Q CASignatureAlgorithms` only list signature
   algorithms that are valid for CA signing. Previous behaviour was
   to list all signing algorithms, including certificate algorithms.

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): gracefully handle systems where rlimits or the
   maximum number of open files is larger than INT_MAX; [bz3581](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3581)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): fix "no comment" not showing on when running
   `ssh-keygen -l` on multiple keys where one has a comment and other
   following keys do not. [bz3580](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3580)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): adjust ftruncate() logic to handle servers that
   reorder requests. Previously, if the server reordered requests then
   the resultant file would be erroneously truncated.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): don't incorrectly disable hostname canonicalization when
   CanonicalizeHostname=yes and ProxyJump was expicitly set to
   "none". [bz3567](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3567)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): when copying local->remote, check that the source file
   exists before opening an SFTP connection to the server. Based on
   [GHPR#370](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/370)

Portability
-----------

 * All: a number of build fixes for various platforms and
   configuration combinations.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): provide a replacement for the SELinux matchpathcon()
   function, which is deprecated.

 * All: relax libcrypto version checks for OpenSSL >=3. Beyond
   OpenSSL 3.0, the ABI compatibility guarantees are wider (only
   the library major must match instead of major and minor in
   earlier versions).  [bz#3548](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3548).

 * Tests: fix build problems for the sk-dummy.so FIDO provider module
   used in some tests.

### [OpenSSH 9.3p2](txt/release-9.3p2) (2023-07-19)

```

OpenSSH 9.3p2 was released on 2023-07-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the

Changes since OpenSSH 9.3
=========================

This release fixes a security bug.

Security
========

Fix CVE-2023-38408 - a condition where specific libaries loaded via
[ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)'s PKCS#11 support could be abused to achieve remote
code execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following
conditions are met:

* Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on
  the victim system.
* Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded
  to an attacker-controlled system.

Exploitation can also be prevented by starting [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) with an
empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P '') or by configuring
an allowlist that contains only specific provider libraries.

This vulnerability was discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable
by the Qualys Security Advisory team.

In addition to removing the main precondition for exploitation,
this release removes the ability for remote [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) clients
to load PKCS#11 modules by default (see below).

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * [ssh-agent(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.8): the agent will now refuse requests to load PKCS#11
   modules issued by remote clients by default. A flag has been added
   to restore the previous behaviour "-Oallow-remote-pkcs11".

   Note that [ssh-agent(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.8) depends on the SSH client to identify
   requests that are remote. The OpenSSH >=8.9 [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) client does
   this, but forwarding access to an agent socket using other tools
   may circumvent this restriction.

### [OpenSSH 9.3](txt/release-9.3)/[9.3p1](txt/release-9.3) (2023-03-15)

```

OpenSSH 9.3 was released on 2023-03-15. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.2
=========================

This release fixes a number of security bugs.

Security
========

This release contains fixes for a security problem and a memory
safety problem. The memory safety problem is not believed to be
exploitable, but we report most network-reachable memory faults as
security bugs.

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): when adding smartcard keys to [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) with the
   per-hop destination constraints (ssh-add -h ...) added in OpenSSH
   8.9, a logic error prevented the constraints from being
   communicated to the agent. This resulted in the keys being added
   without constraints. The common cases of non-smartcard keys and
   keys without destination constraints are unaffected. This problem
   was reported by Luci Stanescu.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Portable OpenSSH provides an implementation of the
   getrrsetbyname(3) function if the standard library does not
   provide it, for use by the VerifyHostKeyDNS feature. A
   specifically crafted DNS response could cause this function to
   perform an out-of-bounds read of adjacent stack data, but this
   condition does not appear to be exploitable beyond denial-of-
   service to the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) client.

   The getrrsetbyname(3) replacement is only included if the system's
   standard library lacks this function and portable OpenSSH was not
   compiled with the ldns library (--with-ldns). getrrsetbyname(3) is
   only invoked if using VerifyHostKeyDNS to fetch SSHFP records. This
   problem was found by the Coverity static analyzer.

New features
------------

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): accept -Ohashalg=sha1|sha256 when
   outputting SSHFP fingerprints to allow algorithm selection. [bz3493](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3493)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a `sshd -G` option that parses and prints the
   effective configuration without attempting to load private keys
   and perform other checks. This allows usage of the option before
   keys have been generated and for configuration evaluation and
   verification by unprivileged users.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix progressmeter corruption on wide displays;
   [bz3534](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3534)

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): use RSA/SHA256 when testing usability
   of private keys as some systems are starting to disable RSA/SHA1
   in libcrypto.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): fix a memory leak. [GHPR363](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/363)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): remove vestigal protocol
   compatibility code and simplify what's left.

 * Fix a number of low-impact Coverity static analysis findings.
   These include several reported via [bz2687](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2687)

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5), [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): mention that some options are not
   first-match-wins.

 * Rework logging for the regression tests. Regression tests will now
   capture separate logs for each ssh and sshd invocation in a test.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): make `ssh -Q CASignatureAlgorithms` work as the manpage
   says it should; [bz3532](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3532).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): ensure that there is a terminating newline when adding a
   new entry to known_hosts; [bz3529](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3529)

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): harden Linux seccomp sandbox. Move to an allowlist of
   mmap(2), madvise(2) and futex(2) flags, removing some concerning
   kernel attack surface.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): improve Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox for older systems;

### [OpenSSH 9.2](txt/release-9.2)/[9.2p1](txt/release-9.2) (2023-02-02)

```

OpenSSH 9.2 was released on 2023-02-02. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the

<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 9.1
=========================

This release fixes a number of security bugs.

Security
========

This release contains fixes for two security problems and a memory
safety problem. The memory safety problem is not believed to be
exploitable, but we report most network-reachable memory faults as
security bugs.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix a pre-authentication double-free memory fault
   introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be exploitable,
   and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is
   subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major
   platforms.

 * [ssh(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.8): in OpenSSH releases after 8.7, the PermitRemoteOpen option
   would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
   keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
   if only one permission was specified. [bz3515](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3515)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): if the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
   options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
   that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
   could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
   characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
   known_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
   have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
   practical exploitation appears unlikely.

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a new EnableEscapeCommandline [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) option that
   controls whether the client-side ~C escape sequence that provides a
   command-line is available. Among other things, the ~C command-line
   could be used to add additional port-forwards at runtime.

   This option defaults to "no", disabling the ~C command-line that
   was previously enabled by default. Turning off the command-line
   allows platforms that support sandboxing of the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) client
   (currently only OpenBSD) to use a stricter default sandbox policy.

New features
------------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add support for channel inactivity timeouts via a new
   [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) ChannelTimeout directive. This allows channels that
   have not seen traffic in a configurable interval to be
   automatically closed. Different timeouts may be applied to session,
   X11, agent and TCP forwarding channels.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a sshd_config UnusedConnectionTimeout option to
   terminate client connections that have no open channels for a
   length of time. This complements the ChannelTimeout option above.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a -V (version) option to sshd like the ssh client has.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a "Host" line to the output of ssh -G showing the
   original hostname argument. [bz3343](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3343)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): add a -X option to both [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) and [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) to
   allow control over some SFTP protocol parameters: the copy buffer
   length and the number of in-flight requests, both of which are used
   during upload/download. Previously these could be controlled in
   [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) only. This makes them available in both SFTP protocol
   clients using the same option character sequence.

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): allow scanning of complete CIDR address ranges,
   e.g.  "ssh-keyscan 192.168.0.0/24". If a CIDR range is passed, then
   it will be expanded to all possible addresses in the range
   including the all-0s and all-1s addresses. [bz#976](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=976)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): support dynamic remote port forwarding in escape
   command-line's -R processing. [bz#3499](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3499)

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when restoring non-blocking mode to stdio fds, restore
   exactly the flags that ssh started with and don't just clobber them
   with zero, as this could also remove the append flag from the set.
   [bz3523](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3523)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): avoid printf("%s", NULL) if using UserKnownHostsFile=none
   and a hostkey in one of the system known hosts file changes.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): switch scp from using pipes to a socket-pair for
   communication with its ssh sub-processes, matching how [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1)
   operates.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): clear signal mask early in main(); sshd may have been
   started with one or more signals masked (sigprocmask(2) is not
   cleared on fork/exec) and this could interfere with various things,
   e.g. the login grace timer. Execution environments that fail to
   clear the signal mask before running sshd are clearly broken, but
   apparently they do exist.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): warn if no host keys for hostbased auth can be loaded.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add server debugging for hostbased auth that is queued and
   sent to the client after successful authentication, but also logged
   to assist in diagnosis of HostbasedAuthentication problems. [bz3507](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3507)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): document use of the IdentityFile option as being usable to
   list public keys as well as private keys. [GHPR352](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/352)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): check for and disallow MaxStartups values less than or
   equal to zero during config parsing, rather than failing later at
   runtime.  [bz3489](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3489)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): fix parsing of hex cert expiry times specified on
   the command-line when acting as a CA.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): when [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) is using the SFTP protocol for transport (the
   default), better match scp/rcp's handling of globs that don't match
   the globbed characters but do match literally (e.g. trying to
   transfer a file named "foo.[1]"). Previously [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) in SFTP mode
   would not match these pathnames but legacy scp/rcp mode would.
   [bz3488](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3488)

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): document the "-O no-restrict-websafe" command-line
   option.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): honour user's umask(2) if it is more restrictive then the
   ssh default (022).

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow writev(2) in the Linux seccomp sandbox. This seems
   to be used by recent glibcs at least in some configurations during
   error conditions. [bz3512](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3512).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): simply handling of SSH_CONNECTION PAM env var, removing
   global variable and checking the return value from pam_putenv.
   [bz3508](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3508)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): disable SANDBOX_SECCOMP_FILTER_DEBUG that was mistakenly
   enabled during the OpenSSH 9.1 release cycle.

 * misc: update autotools and regenerate the config files using the
   latest autotools

 * all: use -fzero-call-used-regs=used on clang 15 instead of
   -fzero-call-used-reg=all, as some versions of clang 15 have
   miscompile code when it was enabled. [bz3475](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3475)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): defer PRNG seeding until after the initial closefrom(2)
   call. PRNG seeding will initialize OpenSSL, and some engine
   providers (e.g. Intel's QAT) will open descriptors for their own
   use that closefrom(2) could clobber. [bz3483](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3483)

 * misc: in the poll(2)/ppoll(2) compatibility code, avoid assuming
   the layout of fd_set.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): fix ptrace(2) disabling on older
   FreeBSD kernels. Some versions do not support using id 0 to refer
   to the current PID for procctl, so try again with getpid()
   explicitly before failing.

 * configure.ac: fix -Wstrict-prototypes in configure test code.
   Clang 16 now warns on this and legacy prototypes will be removed
   in C23. [GHPR355](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/355)

 * configure.ac: fix setres*id checks to work with clang-16. glibc
   has the prototypes for setresuid behind _GNU_SOURCE, and clang 16
   will error out on implicit function definitions. [bz3497](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3497)

### [OpenSSH 9.1](txt/release-9.1)/[9.1p1](txt/release-9.1) (2022-10-04)

```

OpenSSH 9.1 was released on 2022-10-04. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 9.0
=========================

This release is focused on bug fixing.

Security
========

This release contains fixes for three minor memory safety problems.
None are believed to be exploitable, but we report most memory safety
problems as potential security vulnerabilities out of caution.

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): fix a one-byte overflow in SSH- banner processing.
   Reported by Qualys

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): double free() in error path of file hashing step in
   signing/verify code; [GHPR333](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/333)

 * [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8): double-free in error path introduced in openssh-8.9

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * The portable OpenSSH project now signs commits and release tags
   using git's recent SSH signature support. The list of developer
   signing keys is included in the repository as .git_allowed_signers
   and is cross-signed using the PGP key that is still used to sign
   release artifacts:
   <https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/RELEASE_KEY.asc>

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): SetEnv directives in ssh_config and sshd_config
   are now first-match-wins to match other directives. Previously
   if an environment variable was multiply specified the last set
   value would have been used. [bz3438](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3438)

 * [ssh-keygen(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.8): ssh-keygen -A (generate all default host key types)
   will no longer generate DSA keys, as these are insecure and have
   not been used by default for some years.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a RequiredRSASize directive to set a minimum
   RSA key length. Keys below this length will be ignored for user
   authentication and for host authentication in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8).

   [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) will terminate a connection if the server offers an RSA key
   that falls below this limit, as the SSH protocol does not include
   the ability to retry a failed key exchange.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): add a "users-groups-by-id@openssh.com" extension
   request that allows the client to obtain user/group names that
   correspond to a set of uids/gids.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): use "users-groups-by-id@openssh.com" sftp-server
   extension (when available) to fill in user/group names for
   directory listings.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): support the "home-directory" extension request
   defined in draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-extensions-00. This overlaps
   a bit with the existing "expand-path@openssh.com", but some other
   clients support it.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow certificate validity intervals,
   sshsig verification times and authorized_keys expiry-time options
   to accept dates in the UTC time zone in addition to the default
   of interpreting them in the system time zone. YYYYMMDD and
   YYMMDDHHMM[SS] dates/times will be interpreted as UTC if suffixed
   with a 'Z' character.

   Also allow certificate validity intervals to be specified in raw
   seconds-since-epoch as hex value, e.g. -V 0x1234:0x4567890. This
   is intended for use by regress tests and other tools that call
   ssh-keygen as part of a CA workflow. [bz3468](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3468)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): allow arguments to the sftp -D option, e.g. sftp -D
   "/usr/libexec/sftp-server -el debug3"

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow the existing -U (use agent) flag to work
   with "-Y sign" operations, where it will be interpreted to require
   that the private keys is hosted in an agent; [bz3429](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3429)

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): implement the "verify-required" certificate option.
   This was already documented when support for user-verified FIDO
   keys was added, but the [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) code was missing.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): hook up the restrict_websafe command-line flag;
   previously the flag was accepted but never actually used.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): improve filename tab completions: never try to complete
   names to non-existent commands, and better match the completion
   type (local or remote filename) against the argument position
   being completed.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): several fixes to FIDO key
   handling, especially relating to keys that request
   user-verification. These should reduce the number of unnecessary
   PIN prompts for keys that support intrinsic user verification.
   [GHPR302](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/302), [GHPR329](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/329)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): when enrolling a FIDO resident key, check if a
   credential with matching application and user ID strings already
   exists and, if so, prompt the user for confirmation before
   overwriting the credential. [GHPR329](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/329)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): improve logging of errors when opening authorized_keys
   files. [bz2042](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2042)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): avoid multiplexing operations that could cause SIGPIPE from
   causing the client to exit early. [bz3454](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3454)

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5), [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): clarify that the RekeyLimit
   directive applies to both transmitted and received data. [GHPR328](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/328)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid double fclose() in error path.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): log an error if pipe() fails while accepting a
   connection. [bz3447](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3447)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): fix possible NULL deref when built without
   FIDO support. [bz3443](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3443)

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): add missing *-sk types to ssh-keyscan manpage.
   [GHPR294](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/294).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): ensure that authentication passwords are cleared from
   memory in error paths. [GHPR286](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/286)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): avoid possibility of notifier code executing
   kill(-1). [GHPR286](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/286)

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5): note that the ProxyJump directive also accepts the
   same tokens as ProxyCommand. [GHPR305](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/305).

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): do not not ftruncate(3) files early when in sftp mode. The
   previous behaviour of unconditionally truncating the destination
   file would cause "scp ~/foo localhost:foo" and the reverse
   "scp localhost:foo ~/foo" to delete all the contents of their
   destination. [bz3431](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3431)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): improve error message when 'ssh-keygen -Y sign' is
   unable to load a private key; [bz3429](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3429)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1), [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): when performing operations that glob(3) a remote
   path, ensure that the implicit working directory used to construct
   that path escapes glob(3) characters. This prevents glob characters
   from being processed in places they shouldn't, e.g. "cd /tmp/a*/",
   "get *.txt" should have the get operation treat the path "/tmp/a*"
   literally and not attempt to expand it.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): be stricter in which characters will be accepted
   in specifying a mask length; allow only 0-9. [GHPR278](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/278)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid printing hash algorithm twice when dumping a
   KRL

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): continue running local I/O for open channels
   during SSH transport rekeying. This should make ~-escapes work in
   the client (e.g. to exit) if the connection happened to have
   stalled during a rekey event.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): avoid potential poll() spin during rekeying

 * Further hardening for sshbuf internals: disallow "reparenting" a
   hierarchical sshbuf and zero the entire buffer if reallocation
   fails. [GHPR287](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/287)

Portability
-----------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): automatically enable the built-in
   FIDO security key support if libfido2 is found and usable, unless
   --without-security-key-builtin was requested.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): many fixes to make the WinHello
   FIDO device usable on Cygwin. The windows://hello FIDO device will
   be automatically used by default on this platform unless requested
   otherwise, or when probing resident FIDO credentials (an operation
   not currently supported by WinHello).

 * Portable OpenSSH: remove workarounds for obsolete and unsupported
   versions of OpenSSL libcrypto. In particular, this release removes
   fallback support for OpenSSL that lacks AES-CTR or AES-GCM.

   Those AES cipher modes were added to OpenSSL prior to the minimum
   version currently supported by OpenSSH, so this is not expected to
   impact any currently supported configurations.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix SANDBOX_SECCOMP_FILTER_DEBUG on current Linux/glibc

 * All: resync and clean up internal CSPRNG code.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1), [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): avoid linking these programs with
   unnecessary libraries. They are no longer linked against libz and
   libcrypto. This may be of benefit to space constrained systems
   using any of those components in isolation.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add AUDIT_ARCH_PPC to supported seccomp sandbox
   architectures.

 * configure: remove special casing of crypt(). configure will no
   longer search for crypt() in libcrypto, as it was removed from
   there years ago. configure will now only search libc and libcrypt.

 * configure: refuse to use OpenSSL 3.0.4 due to potential RCE in its
   RSA implementation (CVE-2022-2274) on x86_64.

 * All: request 1.1x API compatibility for OpenSSL >=3.x; [GHPR#322](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/322)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix a number of missing includes
   required by the XMSS code on some platforms.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): cache timezone data in capsicum sandbox.

### [OpenSSH 9.0](txt/release-9.0)/[9.0p1](txt/release-9.0) (2022-04-08)

```

OpenSSH 9.0 was released on 2022-04-08. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 8.9
=========================

This release is focused on bug fixing.

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

This release switches [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) from using the legacy scp/rcp protocol
to using the SFTP protocol by default.

Legacy scp/rcp performs wildcard expansion of remote filenames (e.g.
"scp host:* .") through the remote shell. This has the side effect of
requiring double quoting of shell meta-characters in file names
included on [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) command-lines, otherwise they could be interpreted
as shell commands on the remote side.

This creates one area of potential incompatibility: [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) when using
the SFTP protocol no longer requires this finicky and brittle quoting,
and attempts to use it may cause transfers to fail. We consider the
removal of the need for double-quoting shell characters in file names
to be a benefit and do not intend to introduce bug-compatibility for
legacy scp/rcp in [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) when using the SFTP protocol.

Another area of potential incompatibility relates to the use of remote
paths relative to other user's home directories, for example -
"scp host:~user/file /tmp". The SFTP protocol has no native way to
expand a ~user path. However, [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) in OpenSSH 8.7 and later
support a protocol extension "expand-path@openssh.com" to support
this.

In case of incompatibility, the [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) client may be instructed to use
the legacy scp/rcp using the -O flag.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): use the hybrid Streamlined NTRU Prime + x25519 key
   exchange method by default ("sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com").
   The NTRU algorithm is believed to resist attacks enabled by future
   quantum computers and is paired with the X25519 ECDH key exchange
   (the previous default) as a backstop against any weaknesses in
   NTRU Prime that may be discovered in the future. The combination
   ensures that the hybrid exchange offers at least as good security
   as the status quo.

   We are making this change now (i.e. ahead of cryptographically-
   relevant quantum computers) to prevent "capture now, decrypt
   later" attacks where an adversary who can record and store SSH
   session ciphertext would be able to decrypt it once a sufficiently
   advanced quantum computer is available.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): support the "copy-data" extension to allow server-
   side copying of files/data, following the design in
   draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-extensions-00. [bz2948](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2948)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): add a "cp" command to allow the sftp client to perform
   server-side file copies.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): upstream: fix poll(2) spin when a channel's output
   fd closes without data in the channel buffer. [bz3405](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3405) and [bz3411](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3411)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): pack pollfd array in server listen/accept loop. Could
   cause the server to hang/spin when MaxStartups > RLIMIT_NOFILE

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid NULL deref via the find-principals and
   check-novalidate operations. [bz3409](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3409) and [GHPR#307](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/307) respectively.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): fix a memory leak in argument processing. [bz3404](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3404)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): don't try to resolve ListenAddress directives in the sshd
   re-exec path. They are unused after re-exec and parsing errors
   (possible for example if the host's network configuration changed)
   could prevent connections from being accepted.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): when refusing a public key authentication request from a
   client for using an unapproved or unsupported signature algorithm
   include the algorithm name in the log message to make debugging
   easier.

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): refactor platform-specific locked account check, fixing
   an incorrect free() on platforms with both libiaf and shadow
   passwords (probably only Unixware) [GHPR#284](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/284),

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix possible integer underflow in scan_scaled(3)
   parsing of K/M/G/etc quantities. [bz#3401](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3401).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): provide killpg implementation (mostly for Tandem NonStop)
   [GHPR#301](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/301).

 * Check for missing ftruncate prototype. [GHPR#301](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/301)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): default to not using sandbox when cross compiling. On most
   systems poll(2) does not work when the number of FDs is reduced
   with setrlimit, so assume it doesn't when cross compiling and we
   can't run the test.  [bz#3398](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3398).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow ppoll_time64 in seccomp sandbox. Should fix sandbox
   violations on some (at least i386 and armhf) 32bit Linux platforms.
   [bz#3396](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3396).

 * Improve detection of -fzero-call-used-regs=all support in
   configure script.

### [OpenSSH 8.9](txt/release-8.9)/[8.9p1](txt/release-8.9) (2022-02-23)

```

OpenSSH 8.9 was released on 2022-02-23. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

A near-future release of OpenSSH will switch [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) from using the
legacy scp/rcp protocol to using SFTP by default.

Legacy scp/rcp performs wildcard expansion of remote filenames (e.g.
"scp host:* .") through the remote shell. This has the side effect of
requiring double quoting of shell meta-characters in file names
included on [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) command-lines, otherwise they could be interpreted
as shell commands on the remote side.

This creates one area of potential incompatibility: [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) when using
the SFTP protocol no longer requires this finicky and brittle quoting,
and attempts to use it may cause transfers to fail. We consider the
removal of the need for double-quoting shell characters in file names
to be a benefit and do not intend to introduce bug-compatibility for
legacy scp/rcp in [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) when using the SFTP protocol.

Another area of potential incompatibility relates to the use of remote
paths relative to other user's home directories, for example -
"scp host:~user/file /tmp". The SFTP protocol has no native way to
expand a ~user path. However, [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) in OpenSSH 8.7 and later
support a protocol extension "expand-path@openssh.com" to support
this.

Security Near Miss
==================

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix an integer overflow in the user authentication path
   that, in conjunction with other logic errors, could have yielded
   unauthenticated access under difficult to exploit conditions.

   This situation is not exploitable because of independent checks in
   the privilege separation monitor. Privilege separation has been
   enabled by default in since openssh-3.2.2 (released in 2002) and
   has been mandatory since openssh-7.5 (released in 2017). Moreover,
   portable OpenSSH has used toolchain features available in most
   modern compilers to abort on signed integer overflow since
   openssh-6.5 (released in 2014).

   Thanks to Malcolm Stagg for finding and reporting this bug.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), portable OpenSSH only: this release removes in-built
   support for MD5-hashed passwords. If you require these on your
   system then we recommend linking against libxcrypt or similar.

 * This release modifies the FIDO security key middleware interface
   and increments SSH_SK_VERSION_MAJOR.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.8
=========================

This release includes a number of new features.

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): add a system for
   restricting forwarding and use of keys added to [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)
   A detailed description of the feature is available at
   <https://www.openssh.com/agent-restrict.html> and the protocol
   extensions are documented in the PROTOCOL and PROTOCOL.agent
   files in the source release.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add the sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com hybrid
   ECDH/x25519 + Streamlined NTRU Prime post-quantum KEX to the
   default KEXAlgorithms list (after the ECDH methods but before the
   prime-group DH ones). The next release of OpenSSH is likely to
   make this key exchange the default method.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): when downloading resident keys from a FIDO token,
   pass back the user ID that was used when the key was created and
   append it to the filename the key is written to (if it is not the
   default). Avoids keys being clobbered if the user created multiple
   resident keys with the same application string but different user
   IDs.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): better handling for FIDO keys
   on tokens that provide user verification (UV) on the device itself,
   including biometric keys, avoiding unnecessary PIN prompts.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add "ssh-keygen -Y match-principals" operation to
   perform matching of principals names against an allowed signers
   file. To be used towards a TOFU model for SSH signatures in git.

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): allow pin-required FIDO keys to be added
   to [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1). $SSH_ASKPASS will be used to request the PIN at
   authentication time.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow selection of hash at sshsig signing time
   (either sha512 (default) or sha256).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): read network data directly to the packet input
   buffer instead of indirectly via a small stack buffer. Provides a
   modest performance improvement.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): read data directly to the channel input buffer,
   providing a similar modest performance improvement.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): extend the PubkeyAuthentication configuration directive to
   accept yes|no|unbound|host-bound to allow control over one of the
   protocol extensions used to implement agent-restricted keys.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): document that CASignatureAlgorithms, ExposeAuthInfo and
   PubkeyAuthOptions can be used in a Match block. [PR#277](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/277).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix possible string truncation when constructing paths to
   .rhosts/.shosts files with very long user home directory names.

 * [ssh-keysign(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.1): unbreak for KEX algorithms that use SHA384/512
   exchange hashes

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): don't put the TTY into raw mode when SessionType=none,
   avoids ^C being unable to kill such a session. [bz3360](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3360)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): fix some corner-case bugs in SFTP-mode handling of
   ~-prefixed paths.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): unbreak hostbased auth using RSA keys. Allow [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to
   select RSA keys when only RSA/SHA2 signature algorithms are
   configured (this is the default case). Previously RSA keys were
   not being considered in the default case.

 * [ssh-keysign(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.1): make ssh-keysign use the requested signature
   algorithm and not the default for the key type. Part of unbreaking
   hostbased auth for RSA/SHA2 keys.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): stricter UpdateHostkey signature verification logic on
   the client- side. Require RSA/SHA2 signatures for RSA hostkeys
   except when RSA/SHA1 was explicitly negotiated during initial
   KEX; [bz3375](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3375)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix signature algorithm selection logic for
   UpdateHostkeys on the server side. The previous code tried to
   prefer RSA/SHA2 for hostkey proofs of RSA keys, but missed some
   cases. This will use RSA/SHA2 signatures for RSA keys if the
   client proposed these algorithms in initial KEX. [bz3375](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3375)

 * All: convert all uses of select(2)/pselect(2) to poll(2)/ppoll(2).
   This includes the mainloops in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)
   and [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8), as well as the [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) listen loop and all
   other FD read/writability checks. On platforms with missing or
   broken poll(2)/ppoll(2) syscalls a select(2)-based compat shim is
   available.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): the "-Y find-principals" command was verifying key
   validity when using ca certs but not with simple key lifetimes
   within the allowed signers file.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): make sshsig verify-time argument parsing optional

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix truncation in rhosts/shosts path construction.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): avoid xmalloc(0) for PKCS#11 keyid for ECDSA
   keys (we already did this for RSA keys). Avoids fatal errors for
   PKCS#11 libraries that return empty keyid, e.g. Microchip ATECC608B
   "cryptoauthlib"; [bz#3364](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3364)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): improve the testing of credentials against
   inserted FIDO: ask the token whether a particular key belongs to
   it in cases where the token supports on-token user-verification
   (e.g. biometrics) rather than just assuming that it will accept it.

   Will reduce spurious "Confirm user presence" notifications for key
   handles that relate to FIDO keys that are not currently inserted in at
   least some cases. [bz3366](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3366)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): correct value for IPTOS_DSCP_LE. It needs to
   allow for the preceding two ECN bits. [bz#3373](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3373)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add missing -O option to usage() for the "-Y sign"
   option.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): fix a NULL deref when using the find-principals
   function, when matching an allowed_signers line that contains a
   namespace restriction, but no restriction specified on the
   command-line

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): fix memleak in process_extension(); oss-fuzz
   issue #42719

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): suppress "Connection to xxx closed" messages when LogLevel
   is set to "error" or above. [bz3378](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3378)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): use correct zlib flags when inflate(3)-ing
   compressed packet data. [bz3372](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3372)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): when recursively transferring files in SFTP mode, create the
   destination directory if it doesn't already exist to match [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) in
   legacy RCP mode behaviour.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): many improvements in error message consistency between [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1)
   in SFTP mode vs legacy RCP mode.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix potential race in SIGTERM handling [PR#289](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/289)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.8): since DSA keys are deprecated, move them to the
   end of the default list of public keys so that they will be tried
   last. [PR#295](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/295)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow 'ssh-keygen -Y find-principals' to match
   wildcard principals in allowed_signers files

Portability
-----------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): don't trust closefrom(2) on Linux. glibc's
   implementation does not work in a chroot when the kernel does not
   have close_range(2). It tries to read from /proc/self/fd and when
   that fails dies with an assertion of sorts. Instead, call
   close_range(2) directly from our compat code and fall back if
   that fails.  [bz#3349](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3349),

 * OS X poll(2) is broken; use compat replacement. For character-
   special devices like /dev/null, Darwin's poll(2) returns POLLNVAL
   when polled with POLLIN. Apparently this is Apple bug 3710161 -
   not public but a websearch will find other OSS projects
   rediscovering it periodically since it was first identified in
   2005.

 * Correct handling of exceptfds/POLLPRI in our select(2)-based
   poll(2)/ppoll(2) compat implementation.

 * Cygwin: correct checking of mbstowcs() return value.

 * Add a basic SECURITY.md that refers people to the openssh.com
   website.

 * Enable additional compiler warnings and toolchain hardening flags,
   including -Wbitwise-instead-of-logical, -Wmisleading-indentation,
   -fzero-call-used-regs and -ftrivial-auto-var-init.

 * HP/UX. Use compat getline(3) on HP-UX 10.x, where the libc version
   is not reliable.

### [OpenSSH 8.8](txt/release-8.8)/[8.8p1](txt/release-8.8) (2021-09-26)

```

OpenSSH 8.8 was released on 2021-09-26. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

A near-future release of OpenSSH will switch [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) from using the
legacy scp/rcp protocol to using SFTP by default.

Legacy scp/rcp performs wildcard expansion of remote filenames (e.g.
"scp host:* .") through the remote shell. This has the side effect of
requiring double quoting of shell meta-characters in file names
included on [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) command-lines, otherwise they could be interpreted
as shell commands on the remote side.

This creates one area of potential incompatibility: [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) when using
the SFTP protocol no longer requires this finicky and brittle quoting,
and attempts to use it may cause transfers to fail. We consider the
removal of the need for double-quoting shell characters in file names
to be a benefit and do not intend to introduce bug- compatibility for
legacy scp/rcp in [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) when using the SFTP protocol.

Another area of potential incompatibility relates to the use of remote
paths relative to other user's home directories, for example -
"scp host:~user/file /tmp". The SFTP protocol has no native way to
expand a ~user path. However, [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) in OpenSSH 8.7 and later
support a protocol extension "expand-path@openssh.com" to support
this.

Security
========

[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) from OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.7 failed to correctly initialise
supplemental groups when executing an AuthorizedKeysCommand or
AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand, where a AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or
AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directive has been set to run the
command as a different user. Instead these commands would inherit
the groups that [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) was started with.

Depending on system configuration, inherited groups may allow
AuthorizedKeysCommand/AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand helper programs to
gain unintended privilege.

Neither AuthorizedKeysCommand nor AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand are
enabled by default in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5).

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release disables RSA signatures using the SHA-1 hash algorithm
by default. This change has been made as the SHA-1 hash algorithm is
cryptographically broken, and it is possible to create chosen-prefix
hash collisions for <USD$50K [1]

For most users, this change should be invisible and there is
no need to replace ssh-rsa keys. OpenSSH has supported [RFC8332](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332)
RSA/SHA-256/512 signatures since release 7.2 and existing ssh-rsa keys
will automatically use the stronger algorithm where possible.

Incompatibility is more likely when connecting to older SSH
implementations that have not been upgraded or have not closely tracked
improvements in the SSH protocol. For these cases, it may be necessary
to selectively re-enable RSA/SHA1 to allow connection and/or user
authentication via the HostkeyAlgorithms and PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms
options. For example, the following stanza in ~/.ssh/config will enable
RSA/SHA1 for host and user authentication for a single destination host:

    Host old-host
        HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
	PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa

We recommend enabling RSA/SHA1 only as a stopgap measure until legacy
implementations can be upgraded or reconfigured with another key type
(such as ECDSA or Ed25519).

    Application to the PGP Web of Trust" Leurent, G and Peyrin, T
    (2020) <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>

Changes since OpenSSH 8.7
=========================

This release is motivated primarily by the above deprecation and
security fix.

New features
------------
 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow the [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
   directive to accept a "none" argument to specify the default
   behaviour.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): when using the SFTP protocol, continue transferring files
   after a transfer error occurs, better matching original scp/rcp
   behaviour.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fixed a number of memory leaks in multiplexing,

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid crash when using the -Y find-principals
   command.

 * A number of documentation and manual improvements, including
   [bz#3340](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3340), [PR#139](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/139), [PR#215](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/215), [PR#241](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/241), [PR#257](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/257)

Portability
-----------

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): on FreeBSD, use procctl to disable ptrace(2)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): some fixes to the pselect(2) replacement
   compatibility code. [bz#3345](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3345)

### [OpenSSH 8.7](txt/release-8.7)/[8.7p1](txt/release-8.7) (2021-08-20)

```

OpenSSH 8.7 was released on 2021-08-20. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Imminent deprecation notice
===========================

OpenSSH will disable the ssh-rsa signature scheme by default in the
next release.

In the SSH protocol, the "ssh-rsa" signature scheme uses the SHA-1
hash algorithm in conjunction with the RSA public key algorithm.
It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K.

Note that the deactivation of "ssh-rsa" signatures does not necessarily
require cessation of use for RSA keys. In the SSH protocol, keys may be
capable of signing using multiple algorithms. In particular, "ssh-rsa"
keys are capable of signing using "rsa-sha2-256" (RSA/SHA256),
"rsa-sha2-512" (RSA/SHA512) and "ssh-rsa" (RSA/SHA1). Only the last of
these is being turned off by default.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs that is still
enabled by default.

The better alternatives include:

 * The [RFC8332](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332) RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
   supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
   client and server support them.

 * The [RFC8709](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8709) ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported
   in OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656) ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm, for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

OpenSSH recently enabled the UpdateHostKeys option by default to
assist the client by automatically migrating to better algorithms.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): this release changes the behaviour of remote to remote
   copies (e.g. "scp host-a:/path host-b:") to transfer through the
   local host by default. This was previously available via the -3
   flag. This mode avoids the need to expose credentials on the
   origin hop, avoids triplicate interpretation of filenames by the
   shell (by the local system, the copy origin and the destination)
   and, in conjunction with the SFTP support for [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) mentioned
   below, allows use of all authentication methods to the remote
   hosts (previously, only non-interactive methods could be used).
   A -R flag has been added to select the old behaviour.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): both the client and server are now using a
   stricter configuration file parser. The new parser uses more
   shell-like rules for quotes, space and escape characters. It is
   also more strict in rejecting configurations that include options
   lacking arguments. Previously some options (e.g. DenyUsers) could
   appear on a line with no subsequent arguments. This release will
   reject such configurations. The new parser will also reject
   configurations with unterminated quotes and multiple '='
   characters after the option name.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when using SSHFP DNS records for host key verification,
   [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) will verify all matching records instead of just those
   with the specific signature type requested. This may cause host
   key verification problems if stale SSHFP records of a different
   or legacy signature type exist alongside other records for a
   particular host. [bz#3322](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3322)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): when generating a FIDO key and specifying an
   explicit attestation challenge (using -Ochallenge), the challenge
   will now be hashed by the builtin security key middleware. This
   removes the (undocumented) requirement that challenges be exactly
   32 bytes in length and matches the expectations of libfido2.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): environment="..." directives in authorized_keys files are
   now first-match-wins and limited to 1024 discrete environment
   variable names.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.6
=========================

This release contains a mix of new features and bug-fixes.

New features
------------

 - [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): experimental support for transfers using the SFTP protocol
   as a replacement for the venerable SCP/RCP protocol that it has
   traditionally used. SFTP offers more predictable filename handling
   and does not require expansion of glob(3) patterns via the shell
   on the remote side.

   SFTP support may be enabled via a temporary scp -s flag. It is
   intended for SFTP to become the default transfer mode in the
   near future, at which time the -s flag will be removed. The -O
   flag exists to force use of the original SCP/RCP protocol for
   cases where SFTP may be unavailable or incompatible.

 - [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): add a protocol extension to support expansion of
   ~/ and ~user/ prefixed paths. This was added to support these
   paths when used by [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) while in SFTP mode.

 - [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a ForkAfterAuthentication [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) counterpart to
   the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) -f flag. [GHPR#231](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/231)

 - [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a StdinNull directive to [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) that allows the
   config file to do the same thing as -n does on the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) command-
   line. [GHPR#231](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/231)

 - [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a SessionType directive to ssh_config, allowing the
    configuration file to offer equivalent control to the -N (no
    session) and -s (subsystem) command-line flags. [GHPR#231](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/231)

 - [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allowed signers files used by [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1)
   signatures now support listing key validity intervals alongside
   they key, and [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) can optionally check during signature
   verification whether a specified time falls inside this interval.
   This feature is intended for use by git to support signing and
   verifying objects using ssh keys.

 - [ssh-keygen(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.8): support printing of the full public key in a sshsig
   signature via a -Oprint-pubkey flag.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): start time-based re-keying exactly on schedule in
   the client and server mainloops. Previously the re-key timeout
   could expire but re-keying would not start until a packet was sent
   or received, causing a spin in select() if the connection was
   quiescent.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid Y2038 problem in printing certificate
   validity lifetimes. Dates past 2^31-1 seconds since epoch were
   displayed incorrectly on some platforms. [bz#3329](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3329)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): allow spaces to appear in usernames for local to remote
   and scp -3 remote to remote copies. [bz#1164](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove references to ChallengeResponseAuthentication
   in favour of KbdInteractiveAuthentication. The former is what was in
   SSHv1, the latter is what is in SSHv2 ([RFC4256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4256)) and they were
   treated as somewhat but not entirely equivalent. We retain the old
   name as a deprecated alias so configuration files continue to work
   as well as a reference in the man page for people looking for it.
   [bz#3303](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3303)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1)/[ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): fix decoding of X.509 subject name
   when extracting a key from a PKCS#11 certificate. [bz#3327](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3327)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): restore blocking status on stdio fds before close. [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
   needs file descriptors in non-blocking mode to operate but it was
   not restoring the original state on exit. This could cause
   problems with fds shared with other programs via the shell,
   [bz#3280](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3280) and [GHPR#246](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/246)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): switch both client and server mainloops from
   select(3) to pselect(3). Avoids race conditions where a signal
   may arrive immediately before select(3) and not be processed until
   an event fires. [bz#2158](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2158)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): sessions started with ControlPersist were incorrectly
   executing a shell when the -N (no shell) option was specified.
   [bz#3290](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3290)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): check if IPQoS or TunnelDevice are already set before
   overriding. Prevents values in config files from overriding values
   supplied on the command line. [bz#3319](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3319)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix debug message when finding a private key to match a
   certificate being attempted for user authentication. Previously it
   would print the certificate's path, whereas it was supposed to be
   showing the private key's path. [GHPR#247](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/247)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): match host certificates against host public keys, not
   private keys. Allows use of certificates with private keys held in
   a ssh-agent.  [bz#3524](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3524)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a workaround for a bug in OpenSSH 7.4 [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), which
   allows RSA/SHA2 signatures for public key authentication but fails
   to advertise this correctly via SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO. This causes
   clients of these server to incorrectly match
   PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithmse and potentially refuse to offer valid
   keys. [bz#3213](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3213)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1)/[scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): degrade gracefully if a sftp-server offers the
   limits@openssh.com extension but fails when the client tries to
   invoke it. [bz#3318](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3318)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow ssh_config SetEnv to override $TERM, which is
   otherwise handled specially by the protocol. Useful in ~/.ssh/config
   to set TERM to something generic (e.g. "xterm" instead of
   "xterm-256color") for destinations that lack terminfo entries.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): the limits@openssh.com extension was incorrectly
   marked as an operation that writes to the filesystem, which made it
   unavailable in sftp-server read-only mode. [bz#3318](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3318)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix SEGV in UpdateHostkeys debug() message, triggered when
   the update removed more host keys than remain present.

 * many manual page fixes.

Portability
-----------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): move closefrom() to before first malloc. When built against
   tcmalloc, the closefrom() would stomp on file descriptors created
   for tcmalloc's internal use. [bz#3321](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3321)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): handle GIDs > 2^31 in getgrouplist. When compiled in 32bit
   mode, the getgrouplist implementation may fail for GIDs greater than
   LONG_MAX.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): xstrdup environment variable used by ForwardAgent. [bz#3328](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3328)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): don't sigdie() in signal handler in privsep child process;
   this can end up causing sandbox violations per [bz3286](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3286)

### [OpenSSH 8.6](txt/release-8.6)/[8.6p1](txt/release-8.6) (2021-04-19)

```

OpenSSH 8.6 was released on 2021-04-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K.

In the SSH protocol, the "ssh-rsa" signature scheme uses the SHA-1
hash algorithm in conjunction with the RSA public key algorithm.
OpenSSH will disable this signature scheme by default in the near
future.

Note that the deactivation of "ssh-rsa" signatures does not necessarily
require cessation of use for RSA keys. In the SSH protocol, keys may be
capable of signing using multiple algorithms. In particular, "ssh-rsa"
keys are capable of signing using "rsa-sha2-256" (RSA/SHA256),
"rsa-sha2-512" (RSA/SHA512) and "ssh-rsa" (RSA/SHA1). Only the last of
these is being turned off by default.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs that is still
enabled by default.

The better alternatives include:

 * The [RFC8332](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332) RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
   supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
   client and server support them.

 * The [RFC8709](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8709) ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported
   in OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656) ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm, for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

OpenSSH recently enabled the UpdateHostKeys option by default to assist
the client by automatically migrating to better algorithms.

    Application to the PGP Web of Trust" Leurent, G and Peyrin, T

Security
========

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): OpenSSH 8.5 introduced the LogVerbose keyword. When this
   option was enabled with a set of patterns that activated logging
   in code that runs in the low-privilege sandboxed sshd process, the
   log messages were constructed in such a way that printf(3) format
   strings could effectively be specified the low-privilege code.

   An attacker who had sucessfully exploited the low-privilege
   process could use this to escape OpenSSH's sandboxing and attack
   the high-privilege process. Exploitation of this weakness is
   highly unlikely in practice as the LogVerbose option is not
   enabled by default and is typically only used for debugging. No
   vulnerabilities in the low-privilege process are currently known
   to exist.

   Thanks to Ilja Van Sprundel for reporting this bug.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.5
=========================

This release contains mostly bug fixes.

New features
------------

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): add a new limits@openssh.com protocol extension
   that allows a client to discover various server limits, including
   maximum packet size and maximum read/write length.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): use the new limits@openssh.com extension (when available)
   to select better transfer lengths in the client.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add ModuliFile keyword to sshd_config to specify the
   location of the "moduli" file containing the groups for DH-GEX.

 * unit tests: Add a TEST_SSH_ELAPSED_TIMES environment variable to
   enable printing of the elapsed time in seconds of each test.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5), [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): sync CASignatureAlgorithms lists in
   manual pages with the current default. [GHPR#174](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/174)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): ensure that pkcs11_del_provider() is called before exit.
   [GHPR#234](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/234)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix problems in string->argv conversion. Multiple
   backslashes were not being dequoted correctly and quoted space in
   the middle of a string was being incorrectly split. [GHPR#223](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/223)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): return non-zero exit status when killed by signal; [bz#3281](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3281)

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): increase maximum SSH2_FXP_READ to match the maximum
   packet size. Also handle zero-length reads that are not explicitly
   banned by the spec.

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): don't mistakenly exit on transient read errors on the
   network socket (e.g. EINTR, EAGAIN); [bz3297](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3297)

 * Create a dedicated contrib/gnome-ssk-askpass3.c source instead of
   building it from the same file as used for GNOME2. Use the GNOME3
   gdk_seat_grab() to manage keyboard/mouse/server grabs for better
   compatibility with Wayland.

 * Fix portability build errors [bz3293](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3293) [bz3292](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3292) [bz3291](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3291) [bz3278](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3278)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): soft-disallow the fstatat64 syscall in the Linux
   seccomp-bpf sandbox. [bz3276](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3276)

 * unit tests: enable autoopt and misc unit tests that were
   previously skipped

```

OpenSSH 8.5 was released on 2021-03-03. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K.

In the SSH protocol, the "ssh-rsa" signature scheme uses the SHA-1
hash algorithm in conjunction with the RSA public key algorithm.
OpenSSH will disable this signature scheme by default in the near
future.

Note that the deactivation of "ssh-rsa" signatures does not necessarily
require cessation of use for RSA keys. In the SSH protocol, keys may be
capable of signing using multiple algorithms. In particular, "ssh-rsa"
keys are capable of signing using "rsa-sha2-256" (RSA/SHA256),
"rsa-sha2-512" (RSA/SHA512) and "ssh-rsa" (RSA/SHA1). Only the last of
these is being turned off by default.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs that is still
enabled by default.

The better alternatives include:

 * The [RFC8332](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332) RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
   supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
   client and server support them.

 * The [RFC8709](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8709) ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported
   in OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656) ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm, for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

This release enables the UpdateHostKeys option by default to assist
the client by automatically migrating to better algorithms.

    Application to the PGP Web of Trust" Leurent, G and Peyrin, T
    (2020) <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>

Security
========

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): fixed a double-free memory corruption that was
   introduced in OpenSSH 8.2 . We treat all such memory faults as
   potentially exploitable. This bug could be reached by an attacker
   with access to the agent socket.

   On modern operating systems where the OS can provide information
   about the user identity connected to a socket, OpenSSH ssh-agent
   and sshd limit agent socket access only to the originating user
   and root. Additional mitigation may be afforded by the system's
   malloc(3)/free(3) implementation, if it detects double-free
   conditions.

   The most likely scenario for exploitation is a user forwarding an
   agent either to an account shared with a malicious user or to a
   host with an attacker holding root access.

 * Portable [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Prevent excessively long username going to PAM.
   This is a mitigation for a buffer overflow in Solaris' PAM username
   handling (CVE-2020-14871), and is only enabled for Sun-derived PAM
   implementations.  This is not a problem in sshd itself, it only
   prevents sshd from being used as a vector to attack Solaris' PAM.
   It does not prevent the bug in PAM from being exploited via some
   other PAM application. [GHPR#212](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/212)

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): this release changes the first-preference signature
   algorithm from ECDSA to ED25519.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): set the TOS/DSCP specified in the configuration
   for interactive use prior to TCP connect. The connection phase of
   the SSH session is time-sensitive and often explicitly interactive.
   The ultimate interactive/bulk TOS/DSCP will be set after
   authentication completes.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove the pre-standardization cipher
   rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se. It is an alias for aes256-cbc before
   it was standardized in [RFC4253](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253) (2006), has been deprecated and
   disabled by default since OpenSSH 7.2 (2016) and was only briefly
   documented in ssh.1 in 2001.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): update/replace the experimental post-quantum
   hybrid key exchange method based on Streamlined NTRU Prime coupled
   with X25519.

   The previous sntrup4591761x25519-sha512@tinyssh.org method is
   replaced with sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com. Per its
   designers, the sntrup4591761 algorithm was superseded almost two
   years ago by sntrup761.

   (note this both the updated method and the one that it replaced are
   disabled by default)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): disable CheckHostIP by default. It provides insignificant
   benefits while making key rotation significantly more difficult,
   especially for hosts behind IP-based load-balancers.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.4
=========================

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): this release enables UpdateHostkeys by default subject to
   some conservative preconditions:
    - The key was matched in the UserKnownHostsFile (and not in the
      GlobalKnownHostsFile).
    - The same key does not exist under another name.
    - A certificate host key is not in use.
    - known_hosts contains no matching wildcard hostname pattern.
    - VerifyHostKeyDNS is not enabled.
    - The default UserKnownHostsFile is in use.

   We expect some of these conditions will be modified or relaxed in
   future.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a new LogVerbose configuration directive for
   that allows forcing maximum debug logging by file/function/line
   pattern-lists.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when prompting the user to accept a new hostkey, display
   any other host names/addresses already associated with the key.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow UserKnownHostsFile=none to indicate that no
   known_hosts file should be used to identify host keys.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a ssh_config KnownHostsCommand option that allows the
   client to obtain known_hosts data from a command in addition to
   the usual files.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a ssh_config PermitRemoteOpen option that allows the
   client to restrict the destination when RemoteForward is used
   with SOCKS.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): for FIDO keys, if a signature operation fails with a
   "incorrect PIN" reason and no PIN was initially requested from the
   user, then request a PIN and retry the operation. This supports
   some biometric devices that fall back to requiring PIN when reading
   of the biometric failed, and devices that require PINs for all
   hosted credentials.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): implement client address-based rate-limiting via new
   [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) PerSourceMaxStartups and PerSourceNetBlockSize
   directives that provide more fine-grained control on a per-origin
   address basis than the global MaxStartups limit.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Prefix keyboard interactive prompts with "(user@host)" to
   make it easier to determine which connection they are associated
   with in cases like scp -3, ProxyJump, etc. [bz#3224](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3224)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix sshd_config SetEnv directives located inside Match
   blocks. [GHPR#201](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/201)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when requesting a FIDO token touch on stderr, inform the
   user once the touch has been recorded.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): prevent integer overflow when ridiculously large
   ConnectTimeout values are specified, capping the effective value
   (for most platforms) at 24 days. [bz#3229](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3229)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): consider the ECDSA key subtype when ordering host key
   algorithms in the client.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): rename the PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes keyword to
   PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms. The previous name incorrectly suggested
   that it control allowed key algorithms, when this option actually
   specifies the signature algorithms that are accepted. The previous
   name remains available as an alias. [bz#3253](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3253)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): similarly, rename HostbasedKeyTypes (ssh) and
   HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes (sshd) to HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): add missing lsetstat@openssh.com documentation
   and advertisement in the server's SSH2_FXP_VERSION hello packet.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): more strictly enforce KEX state-machine by
   banning packet types once they are received. Fixes memleak caused
   by duplicate SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST (oss-fuzz #30078).

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): allow the full range of UIDs/GIDs for chown/chgrp on 32bit
   platforms instead of being limited by LONG_MAX. [bz#3206](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3206)

 * Minor man page fixes (capitalization, commas, etc.) [bz#3223](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3223)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): when doing an sftp recursive upload or download of a
   read-only directory, ensure that the directory is created with
   write and execute permissions in the interim so that the transfer
   can actually complete, then set the directory permission as the
   final step. [bz#3222](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3222)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): document the -Z, check the validity of its argument
   earlier and provide a better error message if it's not correct.
   [bz#2879](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2879)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): ignore comments at the end of config lines in ssh_config,
   similar to what we already do for sshd_config. [bz#2320](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2320)

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): mention that DisableForwarding is valid in a
   sshd_config Match block. [bz3239](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3239)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix incorrect sorting of "ls -ltr" under some
   circumstances. [bz3248](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3248).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix potential integer truncation of (unlikely)
   timeout values. [bz#3250](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3250)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): make hostbased authentication send the signature algorithm
   in its SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST packets instead of the key type.
   This make HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms do what it is supposed to -
   filter on signature algorithm and not key type.

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a number of platform-specific syscalls to the Linux
   seccomp-bpf sandbox. [bz#3232](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3232) [bz#3260](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3260)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove debug message from sigchld handler that could cause
   deadlock on some platforms. [bz#3259](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3259)

 * Sync contrib/ssh-copy-id with upstream.

 * unittests: add a hostname function for systems that don't have it.
   Some systems don't have a hostname command (it's not required by
   POSIX). The do have uname -n (which is), but not all of those have
   it report the FQDN.

### [OpenSSH 8.4](txt/release-8.4)/[8.4p1](txt/release-8.4) (2020-09-27)

```

OpenSSH 8.4 was released on 2020-09-27. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a
near-future release.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs.

The better alternatives include:

 * The [RFC8332](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332) RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
   supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
   client and server support them.

 * The ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported in
   OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656) ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm, for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

We intend to enable UpdateHostKeys by default in the next OpenSSH
release. This will assist the client by automatically migrating to
better algorithms. Users may consider enabling this option manually.

    Application to the PGP Web of Trust" Leurent, G and Peyrin, T
    (2020) <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>

Security
========

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): restrict ssh-agent from signing web challenges for
   FIDO/U2F keys.

   When signing messages in ssh-agent using a FIDO key that has an
   application string that does not start with "ssh:", ensure that the
   message being signed is one of the forms expected for the SSH protocol
   (currently public key authentication and sshsig signatures).

   This prevents ssh-agent forwarding on a host that has FIDO keys
   attached granting the ability for the remote side to sign challenges
   for web authentication using those keys too.

   Note that the converse case of web browsers signing SSH challenges is
   already precluded because no web RP can have the "ssh:" prefix in the
   application string that we require.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Enable FIDO 2.1 credProtect extension when generating
   a FIDO resident key.

   The recent FIDO 2.1 Client to Authenticator Protocol introduced a
   "credProtect" feature to better protect resident keys. We use this
   option to require a PIN prior to all operations that may retrieve
   a resident key from a FIDO token.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * For FIDO/U2F support, OpenSSH recommends the use of libfido2 1.5.0
   or greater. Older libraries have limited support at the expense of
   disabling particular features. These include resident keys, PIN-
   required keys and multiple attached tokens.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): the format of the attestation information optionally
   recorded when a FIDO key is generated has changed. It now includes
   the authenticator data needed to validate attestation signatures.

 * The API between OpenSSH and the FIDO token middleware has changed
   and the SSH_SK_VERSION_MAJOR version has been incremented as a
   result. Third-party middleware libraries must support the current
   API version (7) to work with OpenSSH 8.4.

 * The portable OpenSSH distribution now requires automake to rebuild
   the configure script and supporting files. This is not required when
   simply building portable OpenSSH from a release tar file.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.3
=========================

New features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): support for FIDO keys that require a PIN for
   each use. These keys may be generated using ssh-keygen using a new
   "verify-required" option. When a PIN-required key is used, the user
   will be prompted for a PIN to complete the signature operation.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): authorized_keys now supports a new "verify-required"
   option to require FIDO signatures assert that the token verified
   that the user was present before making the signature. The FIDO
   protocol supports multiple methods for user-verification, but
   currently OpenSSH only supports PIN verification.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add support for verifying FIDO webauthn
   signatures. Webauthn is a standard for using FIDO keys in web
   browsers. These signatures are a slightly different format to plain
   FIDO signatures and thus require explicit support.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow some keywords to expand shell-style ${ENV}
   environment variables. The supported keywords are CertificateFile,
   ControlPath, IdentityAgent and IdentityFile, plus LocalForward and
   RemoteForward when used for Unix domain socket paths. [bz#3140](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3140)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): allow some additional control over the use of
   ssh-askpass via a new $SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE environment variable,
   including forcibly enabling and disabling its use. [bz#69](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5)'s AddKeysToAgent keyword accept a time
   limit for keys in addition to its current flag options. Time-
   limited keys will automatically be removed from ssh-agent after
   their expiry time has passed.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): allow the -A flag to explicitly enable agent
   forwarding in scp and sftp. The default remains to not forward an
   agent, even when ssh_config enables it.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a '%k' TOKEN that expands to the effective HostKey of
   the destination. This allows, e.g., keeping host keys in individual
   files using "UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts.d/%k". [bz#1654](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1654)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add %-TOKEN, environment variable and tilde expansion to
   the UserKnownHostsFile directive, allowing the path to be
   completed by the configuration (e.g. [bz#1654](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1654))

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow "ssh-add -d -" to read keys to be deleted
   from stdin. [bz#3180](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3180)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): improve logging for MaxStartups connection throttling.
   sshd will now log when it starts and stops throttling and periodically
   while in this state. [bz#3055](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3055)

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): better support for multiple attached FIDO
   tokens. In cases where OpenSSH cannot unambiguously determine which
   token to direct a request to, the user is now required to select a
   token by touching it. In cases of operations that require a PIN to
   be verified, this avoids sending the wrong PIN to the wrong token
   and incrementing the token's PIN failure counter (tokens
   effectively erase their keys after too many PIN failures).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix Include before Match in sshd_config; [bz#3122](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3122)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): close stdin/out/error when forking after authentication
   completes ("ssh -f ...") [bz#3137](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3137)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): limit the amount of channel input data buffered,
   avoiding peers that advertise large windows but are slow to read
   from causing high memory consumption.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): handle multiple requests sent in a single write() to
   the agent.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow sshd_config longer than 256k

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): avoid spurious "Unable to load host key" message when sshd
   load a private key but no public counterpart

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): prefer the default hostkey algorithm list whenever we have
   a hostkey that matches its best-preference algorithm.

 * [sshd(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.1): when ordering the hostkey algorithms to request from a
   server, prefer certificate types if the known_hosts files contain a key
   marked as a @cert-authority; [bz#3157](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3157)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): perform host key fingerprint comparisons for the "Are you
   sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?"
   prompt with case sensitivity.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): ensure that address/masklen mismatches in sshd_config
   yield fatal errors at daemon start time rather than later when
   they are evaluated.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): ensure that certificate extensions are lexically
   sorted. Previously if the user specified a custom extension then
   the everything would be in order except the custom ones. [bz#3198](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3198)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): also compare username when checking for JumpHost loops.
   [bz#3057](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3057)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): preserve group/world read permission on known_hosts
   files across runs of "ssh-keygen -Rf /path". The old behaviour was
   to remove all rights for group/other. [bz#3146](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3146)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Mention the [-a rounds] flag in the ssh-keygen
   manual page and usage().

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): explicitly construct path to ~/.ssh/rc rather than
   relying on it being relative to the current directory, so that it
   can still be found if the shell startup changes its directory.
   [bz#3185](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3185)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): when redirecting sshd's log output to a file, undo this
   redirection after the session child process is forked(). Fixes
   missing log messages when using this feature under some
   circumstances.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): start ClientAliveInterval bookkeeping before first pass
   through select() loop; fixed theoretical case where busy sshd may
   ignore timeouts from client.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): only reset the ServerAliveInterval check when we receive
   traffic from the server and ignore traffic from a port forwarding
   client, preventing a client from keeping a connection alive when
   it should be terminated. [bz#2265](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2265)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid spurious error message when ssh-keygen
   creates files outside ~/.ssh

 * sftp-client(1): fix off-by-one error that caused sftp downloads to
   make one more concurrent request that desired. This prevented using
   [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) in unpipelined request/response mode, which is useful when
   debugging. [bz#3054](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3054)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): handle EINTR in waitfd() and timeout_connect()
   helpers. [bz#3071](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3071)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): defer creation of ~/.ssh until we attempt to
   write to it so we don't leave an empty .ssh directory when it's not
   needed. [bz#3156](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3156)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix multiplier when parsing time specifications
   when handling seconds after other units. [bz#3171](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3171)

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): always send any PAM account messages. If the PAM account
   stack returns any messages, always send them to the user and not
   just if the check succeeds. [bz#2049](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2049)

 * Implement some backwards compatibility for libfido2 libraries
   older than 1.5.0. Note that use of an older library will result
   in the loss of certain features including resident key support,
   PIN support and support for multiple attached tokens.

 * configure fixes for XCode 12

 * gnome-ssh-askpass3: ensure the "close" button is not focused by
   default for SSH_ASKPASS_PROMPT=none prompts. Avoids space/enter
   accidentally dismissing FIDO touch notifications.

 * gnome-ssh-askpass3: allow some control over textarea colour via
   $GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_FG_COLOR and $GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_BG_COLOR
   environment variables.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): document another PAM spec problem in a frustrated comment

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): support NetBSD's utmpx.ut_ss address field. [bz#960](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=960)

 * Add the ssh-sk-helper binary and its manpage to the RPM spec file

 * Detect the Frankenstein monster of Linux/X32 and allow the sandbox
   to function there. [bz#3085](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3085)

### [OpenSSH 8.3](txt/release-8.3)/[8.3p1](txt/release-8.3) (2020-05-27)

```

OpenSSH 8.3 was released on 2020-05-27. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<https://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a
near-future release.

This algorithm is unfortunately still used widely despite the
existence of better alternatives, being the only remaining public key
signature algorithm specified by the original SSH RFCs.

The better alternatives include:

 * The [RFC8332](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332) RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
   algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
   "ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
   supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
   client and server support them.

 * The ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported in
   OpenSSH since release 6.5.

 * The [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656) ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
   have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.

To check whether a server is using the weak ssh-rsa public key
algorithm, for host authentication, try to connect to it after
removing the ssh-rsa algorithm from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)'s allowed list:

    ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=-ssh-rsa user@host

If the host key verification fails and no other supported host key
types are available, the server software on that host should be
upgraded.

A future release of OpenSSH will enable UpdateHostKeys by default
to allow the client to automatically migrate to better algorithms.
Users may consider enabling this option manually. Vendors of devices
that implement the SSH protocol should ensure that they support the
new signature algorithms for RSA keys.

    Application to the PGP Web of Trust" Leurent, G and Peyrin, T
    (2020) <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>

Security
========

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): when receiving files, [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) could be become desynchronised
   if a utimes(2) system call failed. This could allow file contents
   to be interpreted as file metadata and thereby permit an adversary
   to craft a file system that, when copied with [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) in a
   configuration that caused utimes(2) to fail (e.g. under a SELinux
   policy or syscall sandbox), transferred different file names and
   contents to the actual file system layout.

   Exploitation of this is not likely as utimes(2) does not fail under
   normal circumstances. Successful exploitation is not silent - the
   output of [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) would show transfer errors followed by the actual
   file(s) that were received.

   Finally, filenames returned from the peer are (since openssh-8.0)
   matched against the user's requested destination, thereby
   disallowing a successful exploit from writing files outside the
   user's selected target glob (or directory, in the case of a
   recursive transfer). This ensures that this attack can achieve no
   more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within the scp
   protocol.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): reject an argument of "-1" in the same way as [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and
   [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) do instead of accepting and silently ignoring it.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.2
=========================

The focus of this release is bug fixing.

New Features
------------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): make IgnoreRhosts a tri-state option: "yes" to ignore
   rhosts/shosts, "no" allow rhosts/shosts or (new) "shosts-only"
   to allow .shosts files but not .rhosts.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow the IgnoreRhosts directive to appear anywhere in a
   sshd_config, not just before any Match blocks; [bz3148](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3148)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add %TOKEN percent expansion for the LocalFoward and
   RemoteForward keywords when used for Unix domain socket forwarding.
   [bz#3014](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3014)

 * all: allow loading public keys from the unencrypted envelope of a
   private key file if no corresponding public key file is present.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): prefer to use chacha20 from libcrypto where
   possible instead of the (slower) portable C implementation included
   in OpenSSH.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add ability to dump the contents of a binary key
   revocation list via "ssh-keygen -lQf /path" [bz#3132](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3132)

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix IdentitiesOnly=yes to also apply to keys loaded from
   a PKCS11Provider; [bz#3141](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3141)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid NULL dereference when trying to convert an
   invalid [RFC4716](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716) private key.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): when performing remote-to-remote copies using "scp -3",
   start the second [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) channel with BatchMode=yes enabled to
   avoid confusing and non-deterministic ordering of prompts.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): when signing a challenge using a FIDO token,
   perform hashing of the message to be signed in the middleware layer
   rather than in OpenSSH code. This permits the use of security key
   middlewares that perform the hashing implicitly, such as Windows
   Hello.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix incorrect error message for "too many known hosts
   files." [bz#3149](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3149)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): make failures when establishing "Tunnel" forwarding
   terminate the connection when ExitOnForwardFailure is enabled;
   [bz#3116](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3116)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): fix printing of fingerprints on private keys and add
   a regression test for same.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): document order of checking AuthorizedKeysFile (first) and
   AuthorizedKeysCommand (subsequently, if the file doesn't match);
   [bz#3134](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3134)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): document that /etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/shosts.equiv are
   not considered for HostbasedAuthentication when the target user is
   root; [bz#3148](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3148)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): fix NULL dereference in private certificate
   key parsing (oss-fuzz #20074).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): more consistency between sets of %TOKENS are
   accepted in various configuration options.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): improve error messages for some common
   PKCS#11 C_Login failure cases; [bz#3130](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3130)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): make error messages for problems during SSH banner
   exchange consistent with other SSH transport-layer error messages
   and ensure they include the relevant IP addresses [bz#3129](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3129)

 * various: fix a number of spelling errors in comments and debug/error
   messages

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): when downloading FIDO2 resident keys
   from a token, don't prompt for a PIN until the token has told us
   that it needs one. Avoids double-prompting on devices that
   implement on-device authentication.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): no-touch-required FIDO certificate option
   should be an extension, not a critical option.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): offer a better error message
   when trying to use a FIDO key function and SecurityKeyProvider is
   empty.

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-agent(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.8): ensure that a key lifetime fits within
   the values allowed by the wire format (u32). Prevents integer
   wraparound of the timeout values. [bz#3119](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3119)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): detect and prevent trivial configuration loops when using
    ProxyJump. [bz#3057](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3057).

Portability
-----------

 * Detect systems where signals flagged with SA_RESTART will interrupt
   select(2). POSIX permits implementations to choose whether
   select(2) will return when interrupted with a SA_RESTART-flagged
   signal, but OpenSSH requires interrupting behaviour.

 * Several compilation fixes for HP/UX and AIX.

 * On platforms that do not support setting process-wide routing
   domains (all excepting OpenBSD at present), fail to accept a
   configuration attempts to set one at process start time rather than
   fatally erroring at run time. [bz#3126](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3126)

 * Improve detection of egrep (used in regression tests) on platforms
   that offer a poor default one (e.g. Solaris).

 * A number of shell portability fixes for the regression tests.

 * Fix theoretical infinite loop in the glob(3) replacement
   implementation.

 * Fix seccomp sandbox compilation problems for some Linux
   configurations [bz#3085](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3085)

 * Improved detection of libfido2 and some compilation fixes for some
   configurations when --with-security-key-builtin is selected.

    Application to the PGP Web of Trust" Leurent, G and Peyrin, T
    (2020) <https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf>

Security
========

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): this release removes the "ssh-rsa"
   (RSA/SHA1) algorithm from those accepted for certificate signatures
   (i.e. the client and server CASignatureAlgorithms option) and will
   use the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm by default when the
   [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) CA signs new certificates.

   Certificates are at special risk to the aforementioned SHA1
   collision vulnerability as an attacker has effectively unlimited
   time in which to craft a collision that yields them a valid
   certificate, far more than the relatively brief LoginGraceTime
   window that they have to forge a host key signature.

   The OpenSSH certificate format includes a CA-specified (typically
   random) nonce value near the start of the certificate that should
   make exploitation of chosen-prefix collisions in this context
   challenging, as the attacker does not have full control over the
   prefix that actually gets signed. Nonetheless, SHA1 is now a
   demonstrably broken algorithm and futher improvements in attacks
   are highly likely.

   OpenSSH releases prior to 7.2 do not support the newer RSA/SHA2
   algorithms and will refuse to accept certificates signed by an
   OpenSSH 8.2+ CA using RSA keys unless the unsafe algorithm is
   explicitly selected during signing ("ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa").
   Older clients/servers may use another CA key type such as
   ssh-ed25519 (supported since OpenSSH 6.5) or one of the
   ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521 types (supported since OpenSSH 5.7)
   instead if they cannot be upgraded.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the above removal of "ssh-rsa" from the accepted
   CASignatureAlgorithms list.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): this release removes diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
   from the default key exchange proposal for both the client and
   server.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): the command-line options related to the generation
   and screening of safe prime numbers used by the
   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-* key exchange algorithms have
   changed. Most options have been folded under the -O flag.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the sshd listener process title visible to ps(1) has
   changed to include information about the number of connections that
   are currently attempting authentication and the limits configured
   by MaxStartups.

 * ssh-sk-helper(8): this is a new binary. It is used by the FIDO/U2F
   support to provide address-space isolation for token middleware
   libraries (including the internal one). It needs to be installed
   in the expected path, typically under /usr/libexec or similar.

Changes since OpenSSH 8.1
=========================

This release contains some significant new features.

FIDO/U2F Support
----------------

This release adds support for FIDO/U2F hardware authenticators to
OpenSSH. U2F/FIDO are open standards for inexpensive two-factor
authentication hardware that are widely used for website
authentication.  In OpenSSH FIDO devices are supported by new public
key types "ecdsa-sk" and "ed25519-sk", along with corresponding
certificate types.

[ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) may be used to generate a FIDO token-backed key, after
which they may be used much like any other key type supported by
OpenSSH, so long as the hardware token is attached when the keys are
used. FIDO tokens also generally require the user explicitly authorise
operations by touching or tapping them.

Generating a FIDO key requires the token be attached, and will usually
require the user tap the token to confirm the operation:

  $ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk -f ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
  Generating public/private ecdsa-sk key pair.
  You may need to touch your security key to authorize key generation.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/home/djm/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk):
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
  Enter same passphrase again:
  Your identification has been saved in /home/djm/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
  Your public key has been saved in /home/djm/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub

This will yield a public and private key-pair. The private key file
should be useless to an attacker who does not have access to the
physical token. After generation, this key may be used like any other
supported key in OpenSSH and may be listed in authorized_keys, added
to [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1), etc. The only additional stipulation is that the FIDO
token that the key belongs to must be attached when the key is used.

FIDO tokens are most commonly connected via USB but may be attached
via other means such as Bluetooth or NFC. In OpenSSH, communication
with the token is managed via a middleware library, specified by the
SecurityKeyProvider directive in ssh/[sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) or the
$SSH_SK_PROVIDER environment variable for [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) and
[ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1). The API for this middleware is documented in the sk-api.h
and PROTOCOL.u2f files in the source distribution.

OpenSSH includes a middleware ("SecurityKeyProvider=internal") with
support for USB tokens. It is automatically enabled in OpenBSD and may
be enabled in portable OpenSSH via the configure flag
--with-security-key-builtin. If the internal middleware is enabled
then it is automatically used by default. This internal middleware
requires that libfido2 (<https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2>)and its
dependencies be installed. We recommend that packagers of portable
OpenSSH enable the built-in middleware, as it provides the
lowest-friction experience for users.

Note: FIDO/U2F tokens are required to implement the ECDSA-P256
"ecdsa-sk" key type, but hardware support for Ed25519 "ed25519-sk" is
less common. Similarly, not all hardware tokens support some of the
optional features such as resident keys.

The protocol-level changes to support FIDO/U2F keys in SSH are
documented in the PROTOCOL.u2f file in the OpenSSH source
distribution.

There are a number of supporting changes to this feature:

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add a "no-touch-required" option when generating
   FIDO-hosted keys, that disables their default behaviour of
   requiring a physical touch/tap on the token during authentication.
   Note: not all tokens support disabling the touch requirement.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a sshd_config PubkeyAuthOptions directive that
   collects miscellaneous public key authentication-related options
   for [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). At present it supports only a single option
   "no-touch-required". This causes sshd to skip its default check for
   FIDO/U2F keys that the signature was authorised by a touch or press
   event on the token hardware.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add a "no-touch-required" option
   for authorized_keys and a similar extension for certificates. This
   option disables the default requirement that FIDO key signatures
   attest that the user touched their key to authorize them, mirroring
   the similar PubkeyAuthOptions sshd_config option.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add support for the writing the FIDO attestation
   information that is returned when new keys are generated via the
   "-O write-attestation=/path" option. FIDO attestation certificates
   may be used to verify that a FIDO key is hosted in trusted
   hardware. OpenSSH does not currently make use of this information,
   beyond optionally writing it to disk.

FIDO2 resident keys
-------------------

FIDO/U2F OpenSSH keys consist of two parts: a "key handle" part stored
in the private key file on disk, and a per-device private key that is
unique to each FIDO/U2F token and that cannot be exported from the
token hardware. These are combined by the hardware at authentication
time to derive the real key that is used to sign authentication
challenges.

For tokens that are required to move between computers, it can be
cumbersome to have to move the private key file first. To avoid this
requirement, tokens implementing the newer FIDO2 standard support
"resident keys", where it is possible to effectively retrieve the key
handle part of the key from the hardware.

OpenSSH supports this feature, allowing resident keys to be generated
using the [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) "-O resident" flag. This will produce a
public/private key pair as usual, but it will be possible to retrieve
the private key part from the token later. This may be done using
"ssh-keygen -K", which will download all available resident keys from
the tokens attached to the host and write public/private key files
for them. It is also possible to download and add resident keys
directly to [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) without writing files to the file-system
using "ssh-add -K".

Resident keys are indexed on the token by the application string and
user ID. By default, OpenSSH uses an application string of "ssh:" and
an empty user ID. If multiple resident keys on a single token are
desired then it may be necessary to override one or both of these
defaults using the [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) "-O application=" or "-O user="
options. Note: OpenSSH will only download and use resident keys whose
application string begins with "ssh:"

Storing both parts of a key on a FIDO token increases the likelihood
of an attacker being able to use a stolen token device. For this
reason, tokens should enforce PIN authentication before allowing
download of keys, and users should set a PIN on their tokens before
creating any resident keys.

Other New Features
------------------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add an Include sshd_config keyword that allows including
   additional configuration files via glob(3) patterns. [bz2468](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2468)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): make the LE (low effort) DSCP code point available
   via the IPQoS directive; [bz2986](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2986),

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when AddKeysToAgent=yes is set and the key contains no
   comment, add the key to the agent with the key's path as the
   comment. [bz2564](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2564)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): expose PKCS#11 key labels and X.509
   subjects as key comments, rather than simply listing the PKCS#11
   provider library path. [PR138](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/138)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow PEM export of DSA and ECDSA keys; [bz3091](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3091)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): make zlib compile-time optional, available via the
   Makefile.inc ZLIB flag on OpenBSD or via the --with-zlib configure
   option for OpenSSH portable.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): when clients get denied by MaxStartups, send a
   notification prior to the SSH2 protocol banner according to
   [RFC4253](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253) section 4.2.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): when invoking the $SSH_ASKPASS prompt
   program, pass a hint to the program to describe the type of
   desired prompt.  The possible values are "confirm" (indicating
   that a yes/no confirmation dialog with no text entry should be
   shown), "none" (to indicate an informational message only), or
   blank for the original ssh-askpass behaviour of requesting a
   password/phrase.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow forwarding a different agent socket to the path
   specified by $SSH_AUTH_SOCK, by extending the existing ForwardAgent
   option to accepting an explicit path or the name of an environment
   variable in addition to yes/no.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add a new signature operations "find-principals" to
   look up the principal associated with a signature from an allowed-
   signers file.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): expose the number of currently-authenticating connections
   along with the MaxStartups limit in the process title visible to
   "ps".

Bugfixes
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): make ClientAliveCountMax=0 have sensible semantics: it
   will now disable connection killing entirely rather than the
   current behaviour of instantly killing the connection after the
   first liveness test regardless of success. [bz2627](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2627)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): clarify order of AllowUsers / DenyUsers vs AllowGroups /
   DenyGroups in the [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) manual page. [bz1690](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1690)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): better describe HashKnownHosts in the manual page. [bz2560](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2560)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): clarify that that permitopen=/PermitOpen do no name or
   address translation in the manual page. [bz3099](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3099)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow the UpdateHostKeys feature to function when
   multiple known_hosts files are in use. When updating host keys,
   ssh will now search subsequent known_hosts files, but will add
   updated host keys to the first specified file only. [bz2738](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2738)

 * All: replace all calls to signal(2) with a wrapper around
   sigaction(2). This wrapper blocks all other signals during the
   handler preventing races between handlers, and sets SA_RESTART
   which should reduce the potential for short read/write operations.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix a race condition in the SIGCHILD handler that could
   turn in to a kill(-1); [bz3084](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3084)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix a case where valid (but extremely large) SSH channel
   IDs were being incorrectly rejected. [bz3098](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3098)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when checking host key fingerprints as answers to new
   hostkey prompts, ignore whitespace surrounding the fingerprint
   itself.

 * All: wait for file descriptors to be readable or writeable during
   non-blocking connect, not just readable. Prevents a timeout when
   the server doesn't immediately send a banner (e.g. multiplexers
   like sslh)

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): document the sntrup4591761x25519-sha512@tinyssh.org
   key exchange algorithm. [PR#151](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/151)

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): multiple adjustments to the Linux seccomp sandbox:
   - Non-fatally deny IPC syscalls in sandbox
   - Allow clock_gettime64() in sandbox (MIPS / glibc >= 2.31)
   - Allow clock_nanosleep_time64 in sandbox (ARM) [bz3100](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3100)
   - Allow clock_nanosleep() in sandbox (recent glibc) [bz3093](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3093)

 * Explicit check for memmem declaration and fix up declaration if the
   system headers lack it. [bz3102](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3102)

### [OpenSSH 8.1](txt/release-8.1)/[8.1p1](txt/release-8.1) (2019-10-09)

```

OpenSSH 8.1 was released on 2019-10-09. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Security
========

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): an exploitable integer
   overflow bug was found in the private key parsing code for the XMSS
   key type. This key type is still experimental and support for it is
   not compiled by default. No user-facing autoconf option exists in
   portable OpenSSH to enable it. This bug was found by Adam Zabrocki
   and reported via SecuriTeam's SSD program.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): add protection for private keys at
   rest in RAM against speculation and memory side-channel attacks like
   Spectre, Meltdown and Rambleed. This release encrypts private keys
   when they are not in use with a symmetric key that is derived from a
   relatively large "prekey" consisting of random data (currently 16KB).

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): when acting as a CA and signing certificates with
   an RSA key, default to using the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm.
   Certificates signed by RSA keys will therefore be incompatible
   with OpenSSH versions prior to 7.2 unless the default is
   overridden (using "ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa -s ...").

Changes since OpenSSH 8.0
=========================

This release is focused on bug-fixing.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Allow %n to be expanded in ProxyCommand strings

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Allow prepending a list of algorithms to the
   default set by starting the list with the '^' character, E.g.
   "HostKeyAlgorithms ^ssh-ed25519"

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): add an experimental lightweight signature and
   verification ability. Signatures may be made using regular ssh keys
   held on disk or stored in a ssh-agent and verified against an
   authorized_keys-like list of allowed keys. Signatures embed a
   namespace that prevents confusion and attacks between different
   usage domains (e.g. files vs email).

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): print key comment when extracting public key from a
   private key.  [bz#3052](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3052)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): accept the verbose flag when searching for host keys
   in known hosts (i.e. "ssh-keygen -vF host") to print the matching
   host's random-art signature too. [bz#3003](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3003)

 * All: support PKCS8 as an optional format for storage of private
   keys to disk.  The OpenSSH native key format remains the default,
   but PKCS8 is a superior format to PEM if interoperability with
   non-OpenSSH software is required, as it may use a less insecure
   key derivation function than PEM's.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): if a PKCS#11 token returns no keys then try to login and
   refetch them. Based on patch from Jakub Jelen; [bz#2430](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2430)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): produce a useful error message if the user's shell is set
   incorrectly during "match exec" processing. [bz#2791](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2791)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): allow the maximum uint32 value for the argument passed
   to -b which allows better error messages from later validation.
   [bz#3050](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3050)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): avoid pledge sandbox violations in some combinations of
   remote forwarding, connection multiplexing and ControlMaster.

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): include SHA2-variant RSA key algorithms in KEX
   proposal; allows ssh-keyscan to harvest keys from servers that
   disable old SHA1 ssh-rsa. [bz#3029](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3029)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): print explicit "not modified" message if a file was
   requested for resumed download but was considered already complete.
   [bz#2978](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2978)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix a typo and make <esc><right> move right to the
   closest end of a word just like <esc><left> moves left to the
   closest beginning of a word.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): cap the number of permitopen/permitlisten directives
   allowed to appear on a single authorized_keys line.

 * All: fix a number of memory leaks (one-off or on exit paths).

 * Regression tests: a number of fixes and improvements, including
   fixes to the interop tests, adding the ability to run most tests
   on builds that disable OpenSSL support, better support for running
   tests under Valgrind and a number of bug-fixes.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): check for convtime() refusing to accept times that
   resolve to LONG_MAX Reported by Kirk Wolf [bz2977](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2977)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): slightly more instructive error message when the user
   specifies multiple -J options on the command-line. [bz3015](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3015)

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): process agent requests for RSA certificate private
   keys using correct signature algorithm when requested. [bz3016](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3016)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): check for user@host when parsing sftp target. This
   allows user@[1.2.3.4] to work without a path.  [bz#2999](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2999)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): enlarge format buffer size for certificate serial
   number so the log message can record any 64-bit integer without
   truncation. [bz#3012](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3012)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): for PermitOpen violations add the remote host and port to
   be able to more easily ascertain the source of the request. Add the
   same logging for PermitListen violations which where not previously
   logged at all.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): use the correct POSIX format style for left
   justification for the transfer progress meter. [bz#3002](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3002)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) when examining a configuration using sshd -T, assume any
   attribute not provided by -C does not match, which allows it to work
   when sshd_config contains a Match directive with or without -C.
   [bz#2858](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2858)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): downgrade PKCS#11 "provider returned no
   slots" warning from log level error to debug. This is common when
   attempting to enumerate keys on smartcard readers with no cards
   plugged in. [bz#3058](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3058)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): do not unconditionally log in to PKCS#11
   tokens. Avoids spurious PIN prompts for keys not selected for
   authentication in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and when listing public keys available in
   a token using [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1). [bz#3006](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3006)

Portability
-----------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix SIGWINCH delivery of Solaris for multiplexed sessions
   [bz#3030](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3030)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix typo that prevented detection of Linux VRF

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add no-op implementation of pam_putenv to avoid build
   breakage on platforms where the PAM implementation lacks this
   function (e.g. HP-UX). [bz#3008](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3008)

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): fix Solaris privilege sandbox from preventing
   the legacy sftp rename operation from working (was refusing to
   allow hard links to files owned by other users). [bz#3036](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3036)

 * All: add a proc_pidinfo()-based closefrom() for OS X to avoid
   the need to brute-force close all high-numbered file descriptors.
   [bz#3049](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3049)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow mprotect(2) with
   PROT_(READ|WRITE|NONE) only. This syscall is used by some hardened
   heap allocators. Github [PR#142](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/142)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow the s390-specific
   ioctl for ECC hardware support.

 * All: use "doc" man page format if the mandoc(1) tool is present on
   the system. Previously configure would not select the "doc" man
   page format if mandoc was present but nroff was not.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): don't install duplicate STREAMS modules on Solaris; check
   if STREAMS modules are already installed on a pty before installing
   since when compiling with XPG>=4 they will likely be installed
   already. Prevents hangs and duplicate lines on the terminal.
   [bz#2945](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2945) and [bz#2998](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2998),

### [OpenSSH 8.0](txt/release-8.0)/[8.0p1](txt/release-8.0) (2019-04-17)

```

OpenSSH 8.0 was released on 2019-04-17. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Security
========

This release contains mitigation for a weakness in the [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) tool
and protocol (CVE-2019-6111): when copying files from a remote system
to a local directory, [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) did not verify that the filenames that
the server sent matched those requested by the client. This could
allow a hostile server to create or clobber unexpected local files
with attacker-controlled content.

This release adds client-side checking that the filenames sent from
the server match the command-line request,

The scp protocol is outdated, inflexible and not readily fixed. We
recommend the use of more modern protocols like sftp and rsync for
file transfer instead.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): Relating to the above changes to [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1); the scp protocol
   relies on the remote shell for wildcard expansion, so there is no
   infallible way for the client's wildcard matching to perfectly
   reflect the server's. If there is a difference between client and
   server wildcard expansion, the client may refuse files from the
   server. For this reason, we have provided a new "-T" flag to scp
   that disables these client-side checks at the risk of
   reintroducing the attack described above.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Remove support for obsolete "host/port" syntax. Slash-
   separated host/port was added in 2001 as an alternative to
   host:port syntax for the benefit of IPv6 users. These days there
   are establised standards for this like [::1]:22 and the slash
   syntax is easily mistaken for CIDR notation, which OpenSSH
   supports for some things. Remove the slash notation from
   ListenAddress and PermitOpen; [bz#2335](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2335)

Changes since OpenSSH 7.9
=========================

This release is focused on new features and internal refactoring.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): Add support for ECDSA keys in
   PKCS#11 tokens.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add experimental quantum-computing resistant
   key exchange method, based on a combination of Streamlined NTRU
   Prime 4591^761 and X25519.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Increase the default RSA key size to 3072 bits,
   following NIST Special Publication 800-57's guidance for a
   128-bit equivalent symmetric security level.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Allow "PKCS11Provider=none" to override later instances of
   the PKCS11Provider directive in ssh_config; [bz#2974](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2974)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add a log message for situations where a connection is
   dropped for attempting to run a command but a sshd_config
   ForceCommand=internal-sftp restriction is in effect; [bz#2960](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2960)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): When prompting whether to record a new host key, accept
   the key fingerprint as a synonym for "yes". This allows the user
   to paste a fingerprint obtained out of band at the prompt and
   have the client do the comparison for you.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): When signing multiple certificates on a single
   command-line invocation, allow automatically incrementing the
   certificate serial number.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Accept -J option as an alias to ProxyJump on
   the scp and sftp command-lines.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1), ssh-pkcs11-helper(8), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): Accept "-v"
   command-line flags to increase the verbosity of output; pass
   verbose flags though to subprocesses, such as ssh-pkcs11-helper
   started from ssh-agent.

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): Add a "-T" option to allowing testing whether keys in
   an agent are usable by performing a signature and a verification.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): Add a "lsetstat@openssh.com" protocol extension
   that replicates the functionality of the existing SSH2_FXP_SETSTAT
   operation but does not follow symlinks. [bz#2067](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2067)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Add "-h" flag to chown/chgrp/chmod commands to request
   they do not follow symlinks.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Expose $SSH_CONNECTION in the PAM environment. This makes
   the connection 4-tuple available to PAM modules that wish to use
   it in decision-making. [bz#2741](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2741)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add a ssh_config "Match final" predicate Matches in same
   pass as "Match canonical" but doesn't require hostname
   canonicalisation be enabled. [bz#2906](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2906)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Support a prefix of '@' to suppress echo of sftp batch
   commands; [bz#2926](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2926)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): When printing certificate contents using
   "ssh-keygen -Lf /path/certificate", include the algorithm that
   the CA used to sign the cert.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix authentication failures when sshd_config contains
   "AuthenticationMethods any" inside a Match block that overrides
   a more restrictive default.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Avoid sending duplicate keepalives when ClientAliveCount
   is enabled.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix two race conditions related to SIGHUP daemon restart.
   Remnant file descriptors in recently-forked child processes could
   block the parent sshd's attempt to listen(2) to the configured
   addresses. Also, the restarting parent sshd could exit before any
   child processes that were awaiting their re-execution state had
   completed reading it, leaving them in a fallback path.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Fix stdout potentially being redirected to /dev/null when
   ProxyCommand=- was in use.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Avoid sending SIGPIPE to child processes if they attempt
   to write to stderr after their parent processes have exited;
   [bz#2071](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2071)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Fix bad interaction between the ssh_config ConnectTimeout
   and ConnectionAttempts directives - connection attempts after the
   first were ignoring the requested timeout; [bz#2918](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2918)

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): Return a non-zero exit status if no keys were
   found; [bz#2903](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2903)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): Sanitize scp filenames to allow UTF-8 characters without
   terminal control sequences;  [bz#2434](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2434)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix confusion between ClientAliveInterval and time-based
   RekeyLimit that could cause connections to be incorrectly closed.
   [bz#2757](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2757)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): Correct some bugs in PKCS#11 token PIN
   handling at initial token login. The attempt to read the PIN
   could be skipped in some cases, particularly on devices with
   integrated PIN readers. This would lead to an inability to
   retrieve keys from these tokens. [bz#2652](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2652)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): Support keys on PKCS#11 tokens that set the
   CKA_ALWAYS_AUTHENTICATE flag by requring a fresh login after the
   C_SignInit operation. [bz#2638](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2638)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Improve documentation for ProxyJump/-J, clarifying that
   local configuration does not apply to jump hosts.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Clarify manual - ssh-keygen -e only writes
   public keys, not private.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): be more strict in processing protocol banners,
   allowing \r characters only immediately before \n.

 * Various: fix a number of memory leaks, including [bz#2942](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2942) and
   [bz#2938](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2938)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix calculation of initial bandwidth limits.
   Account for bytes written before the timer starts and adjust the
   schedule on which recalculations are performed. Avoids an initial
   burst of traffic and yields more accurate bandwidth limits;
   [bz#2927](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2927)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Only consider the ext-info-c extension during the initial
   key eschange. It shouldn't be sent in subsequent ones, but if it
   is present we should ignore it. This prevents sshd from sending a
   SSH_MSG_EXT_INFO for REKEX for buggy these clients. [bz#2929](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2929)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Clarify manual that ssh-keygen -F (find host in
   authorized_keys) and -R (remove host from authorized_keys) options
   may accept either a bare hostname or a [hostname]:port combo.
   [bz#2935](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2935)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Don't attempt to connect to empty SSH_AUTH_SOCK; [bz#2936](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2936)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Silence error messages when sshd fails to load some of
   the default host keys. Failure to load an explicitly-configured
   hostkey is still an error, and failure to load any host key is
   still fatal. pr/103

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Redirect stderr of ProxyCommands to /dev/null when ssh is
   started with ControlPersist; prevents random ProxyCommand output
   from interfering with session output.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): The ssh client was keeping a redundant ssh-agent socket
   (leftover from authentication) around for the life of the
   connection; [bz#2912](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2912)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix bug in HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes and
   PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes options. If only RSA-SHA2 siganture types
   were specified, then authentication would always fail for RSA keys
   as the monitor checks only the base key (not the signature
   algorithm) type against *AcceptedKeyTypes. [bz#2746](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2746)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Request correct signature types from ssh-agent when
   certificate keys and RSA-SHA2 signatures are in use.

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): On Cygwin, run as SYSTEM where possible, using S4U for
   token creation if it supports MsV1_0 S4U Logon.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): On Cygwin, use custom user/group matching code that
   respects the OS' behaviour of case-insensitive matching.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Don't set $MAIL if UsePAM=yes as PAM typically specifies
   the user environment if it's enabled; [bz#2937](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2937)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) Cygwin: Change service name to cygsshd to avoid collision
   with Microsoft's OpenSSH port.

 * Allow building against OpenSSL -dev (3.x)

 * Fix a number of build problems against version configurations and
   versions of OpenSSL. Including [bz#2931](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2931) and [bz#2921](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2921)

 * Improve warnings in cygwin service setup. [bz#2922](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2922)

 * Remove hardcoded service name in cygwin setup. [bz#2922](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2922)

### [OpenSSH 7.9](txt/release-7.9)/[7.9p1](txt/release-7.9) (2018-10-19)

```

OpenSSH 7.9 was released on 2018-10-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the setting of the new CASignatureAlgorithms
   option (see below) bans the use of DSA keys as certificate
   authorities.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the authentication success/failure log message has
   changed format slightly. It now includes the certificate
   fingerprint (previously it included only key ID and CA key
   fingerprint).

Changes since OpenSSH 7.8
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow most port numbers to be specified using
   service names from getservbyname(3) (typically /etc/services).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow the IdentityAgent configuration directive to accept
   environment variable names. This supports the use of multiple
   agent sockets without needing to use fixed paths.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): support signalling sessions via the SSH protocol.
   A limited subset of signals is supported and only for login or
   command sessions (i.e. not subsystems) that were not subject to
   a forced command via authorized_keys or sshd_config. [bz#1424](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1424)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): support "ssh -Q sig" to list supported signature options.
   Also "ssh -Q help" to show the full set of supported queries.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a CASignatureAlgorithms option for the
   client and server configs to allow control over which signature
   formats are allowed for CAs to sign certificates. For example,
   this allows banning CAs that sign certificates using the RSA-SHA1
   signature algorithm.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow key revocation lists (KRLs) to
   revoke keys specified by SHA256 hash.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow creation of key revocation lists directly
   from base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprints. This supports revoking
   keys using only the information contained in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)
   authentication log messages.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): avoid spurious "invalid format" errors when
   attempting to load PEM private keys while using an incorrect
   passphrase. [bz#2901](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2901)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): when a channel closed message is received from a client,
   close the stderr file descriptor at the same time stdout is
   closed. This avoids stuck processes if they were waiting for
   stderr to close and were insensitive to stdin/out closing. [bz#2863](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2863)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow ForwardX11Timeout=0 to disable the untrusted X11
   forwarding timeout and support X11 forwarding indefinitely.
   Previously the behaviour of ForwardX11Timeout=0 was undefined.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): when compiled with GSSAPI support, cache supported method
   OIDs regardless of whether GSSAPI authentication is enabled in the
   main section of sshd_config. This avoids sandbox violations if
   GSSAPI authentication was later enabled in a Match block. [bz#2107](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2107)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): do not fail closed when configured with a text key
   revocation list that contains a too-short key. [bz#2897](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2897)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): treat connections with ProxyJump specified the same as
   ones with a ProxyCommand set with regards to hostname
   canonicalisation (i.e. don't try to canonicalise the hostname
   unless CanonicalizeHostname is set to 'always'). [bz#2896](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2896)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix regression in OpenSSH 7.8 that could prevent public-
   key authentication using certificates hosted in a [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)
   or against [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) from OpenSSH <7.8.

Portability
-----------

 * All: support building against the openssl-1.1 API (releases 1.1.0g
   and later). The openssl-1.0 API will remain supported at least
   until OpenSSL terminates security patch support for that API version.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow the futex(2) syscall in the Linux seccomp sandbox;
   apparently required by some glibc/OpenSSL combinations.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): handle getgrouplist(3) returning more than
   _SC_NGROUPS_MAX groups. Some platforms consider this limit more
   as a guideline.

### [OpenSSH 7.8](txt/release-7.8)/[7.8p1](txt/release-7.8) (2018-08-24)

```

OpenSSH 7.8 was released on 2018-08-24. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): write OpenSSH format private keys by default
   instead of using OpenSSL's PEM format. The OpenSSH format,
   supported in OpenSSH releases since 2014 and described in the
   PROTOCOL.key file in the source distribution, offers substantially
   better protection against offline password guessing and supports
   key comments in private keys. If necessary, it is possible to write
   old PEM-style keys by adding "-m PEM" to ssh-keygen's arguments
   when generating or updating a key.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove internal support for S/Key multiple factor
   authentication. S/Key may still be used via PAM or BSD auth.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): remove vestigal support for running [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) as setuid. This
   used to be required for hostbased authentication and the (long
   gone) rhosts-style authentication, but has not been necessary for
   a long time. Attempting to execute ssh as a setuid binary, or with
   uid != effective uid will now yield a fatal error at runtime.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the semantics of PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes and the similar
   HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes options have changed. These now specify
   signature algorithms that are accepted for their respective
   authentication mechanism, where previously they specified accepted
   key types. This distinction matters when using the RSA/SHA2
   signature algorithms "rsa-sha2-256", "rsa-sha2-512" and their
   certificate counterparts. Configurations that override these
   options but omit these algorithm names may cause unexpected
   authentication failures (no action is required for configurations
   that accept the default for these options).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the precedence of session environment variables has
   changed. ~/.ssh/environment and environment="..." options in
   authorized_keys files can no longer override SSH_* variables set
   implicitly by sshd.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): the default IPQoS used by ssh/sshd has changed.
   They will now use DSCP AF21 for interactive traffic and CS1 for
   bulk.  For a detailed rationale, please see the commit message:
   <https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/usr.bin/ssh/readconf.c#rev1.284>

Changes since OpenSSH 7.7
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add new signature algorithms "rsa-sha2-256-cert-
   v01@openssh.com" and "rsa-sha2-512-cert-v01@openssh.com" to
   explicitly force use of RSA/SHA2 signatures in authentication.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): extend the PermitUserEnvironment option to accept a
   whitelist of environment variable names in addition to global
   "yes" or "no" settings.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a PermitListen directive to [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) and a
   corresponding permitlisten= authorized_keys option that control
   which listen addresses and port numbers may be used by remote
   forwarding (ssh -R ...).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add some countermeasures against timing attacks used for
   account validation/enumeration. sshd will enforce a minimum time
   or each failed authentication attempt consisting of a global 5ms
   minimum plus an additional per-user 0-4ms delay derived from a
   host secret.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a SetEnv directive to allow an administrator to
   explicitly specify environment variables in sshd_config.
   Variables set by SetEnv override the default and client-specified
   environment.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a SetEnv directive to request that the server sets
   an environment variable in the session. Similar to the existing
   SendEnv option, these variables are set subject to server
   configuration.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow "SendEnv -PATTERN" to clear environment variables
   previously marked for sending to the server. [bz#1285](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1285)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): make UID available as a %-expansion everywhere
   that the username is available currently. [bz#2870](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2870)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow setting ProxyJump=none to disable ProxyJump
   functionality. [bz#2869](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2869)

Bugfixes
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): avoid observable differences in request parsing that could
   be used to determine whether a target user is valid.

 * all: substantial internal refactoring

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix some memory leaks; [bz#2366](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2366)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix a pwent clobber (introduced in openssh-7.7) that could
   occur during key loading, manifesting as crash on some platforms.

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): clarify documentation for AuthenticationMethods
   option; [bz#2663](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2663)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): ensure that the public key algorithm sent in a
   public key SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST matches the content of the
   signature blob. Previously, these could be inconsistent when a
   legacy or non-OpenSSH ssh-agent returned a RSA/SHA1 signature
   when asked to make a RSA/SHA2 signature.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix failures to read authorized_keys caused by faulty
   supplemental group caching. [bz#2873](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2873)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): apply umask to directories, fixing potential mkdir/chmod
   race when copying directory trees [bz#2839](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2839)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): return correct exit code when searching for and
   hashing known_hosts entries in a single operation; [bz#2772](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2772)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): prefer the ssh binary pointed to via argv[0] to $PATH when
   re-executing ssh for ProxyJump. [bz#2831](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2831)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): do not ban PTY allocation when a sshd session is
   restricted because the user password is expired as it breaks
   password change dialog. (regression in openssh-7.7).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix error reporting from select() failures.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): improve documentation for -w (tunnel) flag, emphasising
   that -w implicitly sets Tunnel=point-to-point. [bz#2365](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2365)

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): implement EMFILE mitigation for ssh-agent. ssh-agent
   will no longer spin when its file descriptor limit is exceeded.
   [bz#2576](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2576)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): disable SSH2_MSG_DEBUG messages for Twisted Conch
   clients. Twisted Conch versions that lack a version number in
   their identification strings will mishandle these messages when
   running on Python 2.x (<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9422>)
 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): notify user immediately when underlying ssh process dies
   expectedly. [bz#2719](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2719)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix tunnel forwarding; regression in 7.7 release.
   [bz#2855](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2855)

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): don't kill ssh-agent's listening socket entirely if
   it fails to accept(2) a connection. [bz#2837](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2837)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): relax checking of authorized_keys environment="..."
   options to allow underscores in variable names (regression
   introduced in 7.7). [bz#2851](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2851)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add some missing options in the configuration dump output
   (ssh -G). [bz#2835](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2835)

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Expose details of completed authentication to PAM auth
   modules via SSH_AUTH_INFO_0 in the PAM environment. [bz#2408](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2408)

 * Fix compilation problems caused by fights between zlib and OpenSSL
   colliding uses of "free_func"

 * Improve detection of unsupported compiler options. Recently these
   may have manifested as "unsupported -Wl,-z,retpoline" warnings
   during linking.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): some sandbox support for Linux/s390 [bz#2752](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2752).

 * regress tests: unbreak key-options.sh test on platforms without
   openpty(3). [bz#2856](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2856)

 * use getrandom(2) for PRNG seeding when built without OpenSSL.

### [OpenSSH 7.7](txt/release-7.7)/[7.7p1](txt/release-7.7) (2018-04-02)

```

OpenSSH 7.7 was released on 2018-04-02. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Drop compatibility support for some very old SSH
   implementations, including ssh.com <=2.* and OpenSSH <= 3.*. These
   versions were all released in or before 2001 and predate the final
   SSH RFCs. The support in question isn't necessary for RFC-compliant
   SSH implementations.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.6
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

New Features
------------

 * All: Add experimental support for PQC XMSS keys (Extended Hash-
   Based Signatures) based on the algorithm described in
   <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-xmss-hash-based-signatures-12>
   The XMSS signature code is experimental and not compiled in by
   default.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add a "rdomain" criteria for the sshd_config Match keyword
   to allow conditional configuration that depends on which routing
   domain a connection was received on (currently supported on OpenBSD
   and Linux).

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): Add an optional rdomain qualifier to the
   ListenAddress directive to allow listening on different routing
   domains. This is supported only on OpenBSD and Linux at present.

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): Add RDomain directive to allow the authenticated
   session to be placed in an explicit routing domain. This is only
   supported on OpenBSD at present.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add "expiry-time" option for authorized_keys files to
   allow for expiring keys.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a BindInterface option to allow binding the outgoing
   connection to an interface's address (basically a more usable
   BindAddress)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Expose device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a new
   %T expansion for LocalCommand. This allows LocalCommand to be used
   to prepare the interface.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Expose the device allocated for tun/tap forwarding via a
   new SSH_TUNNEL environment variable. This allows automatic setup of
   the interface and surrounding network configuration automatically on
   the server.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1)/[sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Add URI support to ssh, sftp and scp, e.g.
   ssh://user@host or sftp://user@host/path.  Additional connection
   parameters described in draft-ietf-secsh-scp-sftp-ssh-uri-04 are not
   implemented since the ssh fingerprint format in the draft uses the
   deprecated MD5 hash with no way to specify the any other algorithm.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Allow certificate validity intervals that specify
   only a start or stop time (instead of both or neither).

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Allow "cd" and "lcd" commands with no explicit path
   argument. lcd will change to the local user's home directory as
   usual. cd will change to the starting directory for session (because
   the protocol offers no way to obtain the remote user's home
   directory). [bz#2760](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2760)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): When doing a config test with sshd -T, only require the
   attributes that are actually used in Match criteria rather than (an
   incomplete list of) all criteria.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): More strictly check signature types during key
   exchange against what was negotiated. Prevents downgrade of RSA
   signatures made with SHA-256/512 to SHA-1.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix support for client that advertise a protocol version
   of "1.99" (indicating that they are prepared to accept both SSHv1 and
   SSHv2). This was broken in OpenSSH 7.6 during the removal of SSHv1
   support. [bz#2810](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2810)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Warn when the agent returns a ssh-rsa (SHA1) signature when
   a rsa-sha2-256/512 signature was requested. This condition is possible
   when an old or non-OpenSSH agent is in use. [bz#2799](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2799)

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): Fix regression introduced in 7.6 that caused ssh-agent
   to fatally exit if presented an invalid signature request message.

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): Accept yes/no flag options case-insensitively, as
   has been the case in [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) for a long time. [bz#2664](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2664)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Improve error reporting for failures during connection.
   Under some circumstances misleading errors were being shown. [bz#2814](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2814)

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): Add -D option to allow printing of results directly
   in SSHFP format. [bz#2821](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2821)

 * regress tests: fix PuTTY interop test broken in last release's SSHv1
   removal. [bz#2823](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2823)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Compatibility fix for some servers that erroneously drop the
   connection when the IUTF8 ([RFC8160](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8160)) option is sent.

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): Disable RemoteCommand and RequestTTY in the ssh session
   started by scp (sftp was already doing this.)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Refuse to create a certificate with an unusable
   number of principals.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Fatally exit if ssh-keygen is unable to write all the
   public key during key generation. Previously it would silently
   ignore errors writing the comment and terminating newline.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Do not modify hostname arguments that are addresses by
   automatically forcing them to lower-case. Instead canonicalise them
   to resolve ambiguities (e.g. ::0001 => ::1) before they are matched
   against known_hosts. [bz#2763](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2763)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Don't accept junk after "yes" or "no" responses to hostkey
   prompts. [bz#2803](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2803)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Have sftp print a warning about shell cleanliness when
   decoding the first packet fails, which is usually caused by shells
   polluting stdout of non-interactive startups. [bz#2800](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2800)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Switch timers in packet code from using wall-clock
   time to monotonic time, allowing the packet layer to better function
   over a clock step and avoiding possible integer overflows during
   steps.

 * Numerous manual page fixes and improvements.

Portability
-----------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Correctly detect MIPS ABI in use at configure time. Fixes
   sandbox violations on some environments.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Remove UNICOS support. The hardware and software are literal
   museum pieces and support in sshd is too intrusive to justify
   maintaining.

 * All: Build and link with "retpoline" flags when available to mitigate
   the "branch target injection" style (variant 2) of the Spectre
   branch-prediction vulnerability.

 * All: Add auto-generated dependency information to Makefile.

 * Numerous fixed to the RPM spec files.

### [OpenSSH 7.6](txt/release-7.6)/[7.6p1](txt/release-7.6) (2017-10-03)

```

OpenSSH 7.6 was released on 2017-10-03. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): delete SSH protocol version 1 support, associated
   configuration options and documentation.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove support for the hmac-ripemd160 MAC.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove support for the arcfour, blowfish and CAST
   ciphers.

 * Refuse RSA keys <1024 bits in length and improve reporting for keys
   that do not meet this requirement.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): do not offer CBC ciphers by default.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.5
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release. It also contains substantial
internal refactoring.

Security
--------

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): in read-only mode, sftp-server was incorrectly
   permitting creation of zero-length files. Reported by Michal
   Zalewski.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add RemoteCommand option to specify a command in the ssh
   config file instead of giving it on the client's command line. This
   allows the configuration file to specify the command that will be
   executed on the remote host.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add ExposeAuthInfo option that enables writing details of
   the authentication methods used (including public keys where
   applicable) to a file that is exposed via a $SSH_USER_AUTH
   environment variable in the subsequent session.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add support for reverse dynamic forwarding. In this mode,
   ssh will act as a SOCKS4/5 proxy and forward connections
   to destinations requested by the remote SOCKS client. This mode
   is requested using extended syntax for the -R and RemoteForward
   options and, because it is implemented solely at the client,
   does not require the server be updated to be supported.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow LogLevel directive in sshd_config Match blocks;
   [bz#2717](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2717)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow inclusion of arbitrary string or flag
   certificate extensions and critical options.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow ssh-keygen to use a key held in ssh-agent as
   a CA when signing certificates. [bz#2377](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2377)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow IPQoS=none in ssh/sshd to not set an explicit
   ToS/DSCP value and just use the operating system default.

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): added -q option to make ssh-add quiet on success.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): expand the StrictHostKeyChecking option with two new
   settings. The first "accept-new" will automatically accept
   hitherto-unseen keys but will refuse connections for changed or
   invalid hostkeys. This is a safer subset of the current behaviour
   of StrictHostKeyChecking=no. The second setting "off", is a synonym
   for the current behaviour of StrictHostKeyChecking=no: accept new
   host keys, and continue connection for hosts with incorrect
   hostkeys. A future release will change the meaning of
   StrictHostKeyChecking=no to the behaviour of "accept-new". [bz#2400](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2400)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add SyslogFacility option to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) matching the equivalent
   option in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). [bz#2705](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2705)

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): use HostKeyAlias if specified instead of hostname for
   matching host certificate principal names; [bz#2728](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2728)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): implement sorting for globbed ls; [bz#2649](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2649)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add a user@host prefix to client's "Permission denied"
   messages, useful in particular when using "stacked" connections
   (e.g. ssh -J) where it's not clear which host is denying. [bz#2720](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2720)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): accept unknown EXT_INFO extension values that contain \0

### [OpenSSH 7.5](txt/release-7.5)/[7.5p1](txt/release-7.5) (2017-03-20)

```

OpenSSH 7.5 was released on 2017-03-20. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:

 * In the next major release (expected June-August), removing remaining
   support for the SSH v.1 protocol (currently client-only and compile-
   time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
   and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing the remaining CBC ciphers from being
   offered by default in the client (These have not been offered in
   sshd by default for several years).

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * This release deprecates the sshd_config UsePrivilegeSeparation
   option, thereby making privilege separation mandatory. Privilege
   separation has been on by default for almost 15 years and
   sandboxing has been on by default for almost the last five.

 * The format of several log messages emitted by the packet code has
   changed to include additional information about the user and
   their authentication state. Software that monitors ssh/sshd logs
   may need to account for these changes. For example:

   Connection closed by user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
   Connection closed by authenticating user x 10.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]
   Connection closed by invalid user x 1.1.1.1 port 1234 [preauth]

   Affected messages include connection closure, timeout, remote
   disconnection, negotiation failure and some other fatal messages
   generated by the packet code.

 * [Portable OpenSSH only] This version removes support for building
   against OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.1. OpenSSL stopped supporting
   versions prior to 1.0.1 over 12 months ago (i.e. they no longer
   receive fixes for security bugs).

Changes since OpenSSH 7.4
=========================

This is a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix weakness in CBC padding oracle countermeasures
   that allowed a variant of the attack fixed in OpenSSH 7.3 to proceed.
   Note that the OpenSSH client disables CBC ciphers by default, sshd
   offers them as lowest-preference options and will remove them by
   default entriely in the next release. Reported by Jean Paul
   Degabriele, Kenny Paterson, Martin Albrecht and Torben Hansen of
   Royal Holloway, University of London.

 * sftp-client(1): [portable OpenSSH only] On Cygwin, a client making
   a recursive file transfer could be maniuplated by a hostile server to
   perform a path-traversal attack. creating or modifying files outside
   of the intended target directory. Reported by Jann Horn of Google
   Project Zero.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Support "=-" syntax to easily remove methods from

   "ssh-keygen -H" on a known_hosts containing already-hashed entries.

 * Fix various fallout and sharp edges caused by removing SSH protocol
   1 support from the server, including the server banner string being
   incorrectly terminated with only \n (instead of \r\n), confusing
   error messages from ssh-keyscan [bz#2583](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2583) and a segfault in sshd
   if protocol v.1 was enabled for the client and sshd_config

   [bz#2520](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2520)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Return reason for port forwarding failures where

### [OpenSSH 7.4](txt/release-7.4)/[7.4p1](txt/release-7.4) (2016-12-19)

```

OpenSSH 7.4 was released on 2016-12-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in future releases,
specifically:

 * In approximately August 2017, removing remaining support for the
   SSH v.1 protocol (client-only and currently compile-time disabled).

 * In the same release, removing support for Blowfish and RC4 ciphers
   and the RIPE-MD160 HMAC. (These are currently run-time disabled).

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * The next release of OpenSSH will remove support for running [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)
   with privilege separation disabled.

 * The next release of portable OpenSSH will remove support for
   OpenSSL version prior to 1.0.1.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * This release removes server support for the SSH v.1 protocol.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Remove 3des-cbc from the client's default proposal. 64-bit
   block ciphers are not safe in 2016 and we don't want to wait until
   attacks like SWEET32 are extended to SSH. As 3des-cbc was the
   only mandatory cipher in the SSH RFCs, this may cause problems
   connecting to older devices using the default configuration,
   but it's highly likely that such devices already need explicit
   configuration for key exchange and hostkey algorithms already
   anyway.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Remove support for pre-authentication compression.
   Doing compression early in the protocol probably seemed reasonable
   in the 1990s, but today it's clearly a bad idea in terms of both
   cryptography (cf. multiple compression oracle attacks in TLS) and
   attack surface. Pre-auth compression support has been disabled by
   default for >10 years. Support remains in the client.

 * ssh-agent will refuse to load PKCS#11 modules outside a whitelist
   of trusted paths by default. The path whitelist may be specified
   at run-time.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): When a forced-command appears in both a certificate and
   an authorized keys/principals command= restriction, sshd will now
   refuse to accept the certificate unless they are identical.
   The previous (documented) behaviour of having the certificate
   forced-command override the other could be a bit confusing and
   error-prone.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Remove the UseLogin configuration directive and support
   for having /bin/login manage login sessions.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.3
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths
   outside a trusted whitelist (run-time configurable). Requests to
   load modules could be passed via agent forwarding and an attacker
   could attempt to load a hostile PKCS#11 module across the forwarded
   agent channel: PKCS#11 modules are shared libraries, so this would
   result in code execution on the system running the ssh-agent if the
   attacker has control of the forwarded agent-socket (on the host
   running the sshd server) and the ability to write to the filesystem
   of the host running ssh-agent (usually the host running the ssh
   client). Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-
   domain sockets would be created by [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) with the privileges of
   'root' instead of the authenticated user. This release refuses
   Unix-domain socket forwarding when privilege separation is disabled
   (Privilege separation has been enabled by default for 14 years).
   Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
   privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading
   keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys,
   nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material
   to unprivileged users. Reported by Jann Horn of Project Zero.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication
   compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by
   some optimising compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was
   incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was
   disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the
   privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
   process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
   This release removes support for pre-authentication compression
   from [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). Reported by Guido Vranken using the Stack unstable
   optimisation identification tool (<http://css.csail.mit.edu/stack/>)
 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix denial-of-service condition where an attacker who
   sends multiple KEXINIT messages may consume up to 128MB per
   connection. Reported by Shi Lei of Gear Team, Qihoo 360.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers
   directives at configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid
   ones. It was previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address
   ranges (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match,
   possibly resulting in granting access where it was not intended.
   Reported by Laurence Parry.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a proxy multiplexing mode to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) inspired by the
   version in PuTTY by Simon Tatham. This allows a multiplexing
   client to communicate with the master process using a subset of
   the SSH packet and channels protocol over a Unix-domain socket,
   with the main process acting as a proxy that translates channel
   IDs, etc.  This allows multiplexing mode to run on systems that
   lack file- descriptor passing (used by current multiplexing
   code) and potentially, in conjunction with Unix-domain socket
   forwarding, with the client and multiplexing master process on
   different machines. Multiplexing proxy mode may be invoked using
   "ssh -O proxy ..."

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add a sshd_config DisableForwarding option that disables
   X11, agent, TCP, tunnel and Unix domain socket forwarding, as well
   as anything else we might implement in the future. Like the
   'restrict' authorized_keys flag, this is intended to be a simple
   and future-proof way of restricting an account.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Support the "curve25519-sha256" key exchange
   method. This is identical to the currently-supported method named
   "curve25519-sha256@libssh.org".

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Improve handling of SIGHUP by checking to see if sshd is
   already daemonised at startup and skipping the call to daemon(3)
   if it is. This ensures that a SIGHUP restart of [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will
   retain the same process-ID as the initial execution. [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will
   also now unlink the PidFile prior to SIGHUP restart and re-create
   it after a successful restart, rather than leaving a stale file in
   the case of a configuration error. [bz#2641](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2641)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Allow ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax
   directives to appear in sshd_config Match blocks.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add %-escapes to AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand to match
   those supported by AuthorizedKeysCommand (key, key type,
   fingerprint, etc.) and a few more to provide access to the
   contents of the certificate being offered.

 * Added regression tests for string matching, address matching and
   string sanitisation functions.

 * Improved the key exchange fuzzer harness.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Allow IdentityFile to successfully load and use
   certificates that have no corresponding bare public key. [bz#2617](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2617)
   certificate id_rsa-cert.pub (and no id_rsa.pub).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Fix public key authentication when multiple
   authentication is in use and publickey is not just the first
   method attempted. [bz#2642](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2642)

 * regress: Allow the PuTTY interop tests to run unattended. [bz#2639](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2639)

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): improve reporting when attempting to load
   keys from PKCS#11 tokens with fewer useless log messages and more
   detail in debug messages. [bz#2610](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2610)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): When tearing down ControlMaster connections, don't
   pollute stderr when LogLevel=quiet.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): On ^Z wait for underlying [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to suspend before
   suspending [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) to ensure that [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) restores the terminal mode
   correctly if suspended during a password prompt.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Avoid busy-wait when [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) is suspended during a password
   prompt.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Correctly report errors during sending of ext-
   info messages.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix NULL-deref crash if [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) received an out-of-
   sequence NEWKEYS message.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Correct list of supported signature algorithms sent in
   the server-sig-algs extension. [bz#2547](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2547)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix sending ext_info message if privsep is disabled.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): more strictly enforce the expected ordering of privilege
   separation monitor calls used for authentication and allow them
   only when their respective authentication methods are enabled
   in the configuration

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix uninitialised optlen in getsockopt() call; harmless
   on Unix/BSD but potentially crashy on Cygwin.

 * Fix false positive reports caused by explicit_bzero(3) not being
   recognised as a memory initialiser when compiled with
   -fsanitize-memory.

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): Use 2001:db8::/32, the official IPv6 subnet for
   configuration examples.

Portability
-----------

 * On environments configured with Turkish locales, fall back to the
   C/POSIX locale to avoid errors in configuration parsing caused by
   that locale's unique handling of the letters 'i' and 'I'. [bz#2643](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2643)

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): Deny ptrace on OS X using
   ptrace(PT_DENY_ATTACH, ..)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Unbreak AES-CTR ciphers on old (~0.9.8) OpenSSL.

 * Fix compilation for libcrypto compiled without RIPEMD160 support.

 * contrib: Add a gnome-ssh-askpass3 with GTK+3 support. [bz#2640](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2640)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Improve PRNG reseeding across privilege separation and
   force libcrypto to obtain a high-quality seed before chroot or
   sandboxing.

 * All: Explicitly test for broken strnvis. NetBSD added an strnvis
   and unfortunately made it incompatible with the existing one in
   OpenBSD and Linux's libbsd (the former having existed for over ten
   years). Try to detect this mess, and assume the only safe option
   if we're cross compiling.

### [OpenSSH 7.3](txt/release-7.3)/[7.3p1](txt/release-7.3) (2016-08-01)

```

OpenSSH 7.3 was released on 2016-08-01. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in a near-future
release, specifically:

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)
 * Removing server-side support for the SSH v.1 protocol (currently
   compile-time disabled).
 * In approximately 1 year, removing all support for the SSH v.1
   protocol (currently compile-time disabled).

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.2
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against
   the system's crypt(3) function via [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). An attacker could
   send very long passwords that would cause excessive CPU use in
   crypt(3). [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now refuses to accept password authentication
   requests of length greater than 1024 characters. Independently
   reported by Tomas Kuthan (Oracle), Andres Rojas and Javier Nieto.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Mitigate timing differences in password authentication
   that could be used to discern valid from invalid account names
   when long passwords were sent and particular password hashing
   algorithms are in use on the server. CVE-2016-6210, reported by
   EddieEzra.Harari at verint.com

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix observable timing weakness in the CBC padding
   oracle countermeasures. Reported by Jean Paul Degabriele, Kenny
   Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin Albrecht. Note that CBC ciphers
   are disabled by default and only included for legacy compatibility.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Improve operation ordering of MAC verification for
   Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) mode transport MAC algorithms to verify the
   MAC before decrypting any ciphertext. This removes the possibility
   of timing differences leaking facts about the plaintext, though no
   such leakage has been observed.  Reported by Jean Paul Degabriele,
   Kenny Paterson, Torben Hansen and Martin Albrecht.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): (portable only) Ignore PAM environment vars when
   UseLogin=yes. If PAM is configured to read user-specified
   environment variables and UseLogin=yes in sshd_config, then a
   hostile local user may attack /bin/login via LD_PRELOAD or
   similar environment variables set via PAM. CVE-2015-8325,
   found by Shayan Sadigh.

New Features
------------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a ProxyJump option and corresponding -J command-line
   flag to allow simplified indirection through a one or more SSH
   bastions or "jump hosts".

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add an IdentityAgent option to allow specifying specific
   agent sockets instead of accepting one from the environment.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Allow ExitOnForwardFailure and ClearAllForwardings to be
   optionally overridden when using ssh -W. [bz#2577](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2577)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Implement support for the IUTF8 terminal mode as
   per draft-sgtatham-secsh-iutf8-00.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add support for additional fixed Diffie-Hellman
   2K, 4K and 8K groups from draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2-03.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): support SHA256 and SHA512 RSA
   signatures in certificates;

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add an Include directive for [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) files.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Permit UTF-8 characters in pre-authentication banners sent
   from the server. [bz#2058](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2058)

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Reduce the syslog level of some relatively common
   protocol events from LOG_CRIT. [bz#2585](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2585)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Refuse AuthenticationMethods="" in configurations and
   accept AuthenticationMethods=any for the default behaviour of not
   requiring multiple authentication. [bz#2398](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2398)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Remove obsolete and misleading "POSSIBLE BREAK-IN
   ATTEMPT!" message when forward and reverse DNS don't match. [bz#2585](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2585)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Close ControlPersist background process stderr except
   in debug mode or when logging to syslog. [bz#1988](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1988)

 * misc: Make PROTOCOL description for direct-streamlocal@openssh.com
   channel open messages match deployed code. [bz#2529](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2529)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Deduplicate LocalForward and RemoteForward entries to fix
   failures when both ExitOnForwardFailure and hostname
   canonicalisation are enabled. [bz#2562](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2562)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Remove fallback from moduli to obsolete "primes" file
   that was deprecated in 2001. [bz#2559](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2559).

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): Correct description of UseDNS: it affects ssh
   hostname processing for authorized_keys, not known_hosts; [bz#2554](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2554)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Fix authentication using lone certificate keys in an agent
   without corresponding private keys on the filesystem. [bz#2550](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2550)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Send ClientAliveInterval pings when a time-based
   RekeyLimit is set; previously keepalive packets were not being
   sent. [bz#2252](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2252)

Portability
-----------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix compilation by automatically disabling ciphers
   not supported by OpenSSL. [bz#2466](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2466)

 * misc: Fix compilation failures on some versions of AIX's compiler
   related to the definition of the VA_COPY macro. [bz#2589](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2589)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Whitelist more architectures to enable the seccomp-bpf
   sandbox. [bz#2590](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2590)

### [OpenSSH 7.2](txt/release-7.2)/[7.2p1](txt/release-7.2) (2016-02-29)

```

OpenSSH 7.2 was released on 2016-02-29. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in a near-future
release, specifically:

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for future releases.

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release disables a number of legacy cryptographic algorithms
by default in ssh:

 * Several ciphers blowfish-cbc, cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants
   and the rijndael-cbc aliases for AES.

 * MD5-based and truncated HMAC algorithms.

These algorithms are already disabled by default in sshd.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.1p2
===========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove unfinished and unused roaming code (was
   already forcibly disabled in OpenSSH 7.1p2).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): eliminate fallback from untrusted X11 forwarding to
   trusted forwarding when the X server disables the SECURITY
   extension.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): increase the minimum modulus size supported for
   diffie-hellman-group-exchange to 2048 bits.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): pre-auth sandboxing is now enabled by default (previous
   releases enabled it for new installations via sshd_config).

New Features
------------

 * all: add support for RSA signatures using SHA-256/512 hash
   algorithms based on draft-rsa-dsa-sha2-256-03.txt and
   draft-ssh-ext-info-04.txt.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add an AddKeysToAgent client option which can be set to
   'yes', 'no', 'ask', or 'confirm', and defaults to 'no'.  When
   enabled, a private key that is used during authentication will be
   added to ssh-agent if it is running (with confirmation enabled if
   set to 'confirm').

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a new authorized_keys option "restrict" that includes
   all current and future key restrictions (no-*-forwarding, etc.).
   Also add permissive versions of the existing restrictions, e.g.
   "no-pty" -> "pty". This simplifies the task of setting up
   restricted keys and ensures they are maximally-restricted,
   regardless of any permissions we might implement in the future.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add ssh_config CertificateFile option to explicitly list
   certificates. [bz#2436](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2436)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow ssh-keygen to change the key comment for all
   supported formats.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow fingerprinting from standard input, e.g.
   "ssh-keygen -lf -"

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): allow fingerprinting multiple public keys in a
   file, e.g. "ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" [bz#1319](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1319)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): support "none" as an argument for sshd_config
   Foreground and ChrootDirectory. Useful inside Match blocks to
   override a global default. [bz#2486](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2486)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): support multiple certificates (one per line) and
   reading from standard input (using "-f -") for "ssh-keygen -L"

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): add "ssh-keyscan -c ..." flag to allow fetching
   certificates instead of plain keys.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): better handle anchored FQDNs (e.g. 'cvs.openbsd.org.') in
   hostname canonicalisation - treat them as already canonical and
   remove the trailing '.' before matching ssh_config.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): existing destination directories should not terminate
   recursive uploads (regression in openssh 6.8) [bz#2528](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2528)

   already what is needed; makes it possible to use tun/tap
   networking as non-root user if device permissions and interface
   flags are pre-established

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): RekeyLimits could be exceeded by one packet.

### [OpenSSH 7.1p2](txt/release-7.1p2) (2016-01-14)

```

OpenSSH 7.1p2 was released on 2016-01-14. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols
that may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 7.1p1
===========================

 * SECURITY: [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): The OpenSSH client code between 5.4 and 7.1
   contains experimental support for resuming SSH-connections (roaming).

   The matching server code has never been shipped, but the client
   code was enabled by default and could be tricked by a malicious
   server into leaking client memory to the server, including private
   client user keys.

   The authentication of the server host key prevents exploitation
   by a man-in-the-middle, so this information leak is restricted
   to connections to malicious or compromised servers.

   MITIGATION: For OpenSSH >= 5.4 the vulnerable code in the client
   can be completely disabled by adding 'UseRoaming no' to the gobal
   [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) file, or to user configuration in ~/.ssh/config,
   or by passing -oUseRoaming=no on the command line.

   PATCH: See below for a patch to disable this feature (Disabling
   Roaming in the Source Code).

   This problem was reported by the Qualys Security Advisory team.

 * SECURITY: Fix an out of-bound read access in the packet handling
   code. Reported by Ben Hawkes.

 * PROTOCOL: Correctly interpret the 'first_kex_follows' option during
   the intial key exchange. Reported by Matt Johnston.

 * Further use of explicit_bzero has been added in various buffer
   handling code paths to guard against compilers aggressively
   doing dead-store removal.

Future deprecation notice
=========================

We plan on retiring more legacy cryptography in the next release
including:

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

 * Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc,
   cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases
   for AES.

 * MD5-based HMAC algorithms will be disabled by default.

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for OpenSSH 7.2 when it is released.

Changes since OpenSSH 7.0
=========================

This is a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): OpenSSH 7.0 contained a logic error in PermitRootLogin=
   prohibit-password/without-password that could, depending on
   compile-time configuration, permit password authentication to
   root while preventing other forms of authentication. This problem
   was reported by Mantas Mikulenas.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add compatibility workarounds for FuTTY

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): refine compatibility workarounds for WinSCP

 * Fix a number of memory faults (double-free, free of uninitialised
   memory, etc) in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1). Reported by Mateusz

release notes for OpenSSH 7.1 when it is released.

Changes since OpenSSH 6.9
=========================

This focus of this release is primarily to deprecate weak, legacy
and/or unsafe cryptography.

Security
--------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 incorrectly set TTYs to be world-
   writable. Local attackers may be able to write arbitrary messages
   to logged-in users, including terminal escape sequences.
   Reported by Nikolay Edigaryev.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation
   weakness related to PAM support. Attackers who could successfully
   compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
   execution and who had valid credentials on the host could
   impersonate other users.  Reported by Moritz Jodeit.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a use-after-free bug
   related to PAM support that was reachable by attackers who could
   compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
   execution. Also reported by Moritz Jodeit.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix circumvention of MaxAuthTries using keyboard-
   interactive authentication. By specifying a long, repeating
   keyboard-interactive "devices" string, an attacker could request
   the same authentication method be tried thousands of times in
   a single pass. The LoginGraceTime timeout in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) and any
   authentication failure delays implemented by the authentication
   mechanism itself were still applied. Found by Kingcope.

Potentially-incompatible Changes
--------------------------------

 * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by
   default at compile time.

 * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
   is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using
   the instructions at <http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html>

 * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled
   by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the
   instructions at <http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html>

 * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.

 * The default for the [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) PermitRootLogin option has
   changed from "yes" to "prohibit-password".

 * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all
   interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,
   hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted
   keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those
   were enabled).

New Features
------------

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5): add PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes option to control which
   public key types are available for user authentication.

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): add HostKeyAlgorithms option to control which
   public key types are offered for host authentications.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): extend Ciphers, MACs, KexAlgorithms,
   HostKeyAlgorithms, PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes and HostbasedKeyTypes
   options to allow appending to the default set of algorithms
   instead of replacing it. Options may now be prefixed with a '+'
   to append to the default, e.g. "HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss".

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): PermitRootLogin now accepts an argument of
   'prohibit-password' as a less-ambiguous synonym of 'without-
   password'.

Bugfixes
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add compatability workarounds for Cisco and more
   PuTTY versions. [bz#2424](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2424)

### [OpenSSH 6.9](txt/release-6.9)/[6.9p1](txt/release-6.9) (2015-07-01)

```

OpenSSH 6.9 was released on 2015-07-01. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Future Deprecation Notice
=========================

The 7.0 release of OpenSSH, due for release in late July, will
deprecate several features, some of which may affect compatibility
or existing configurations. The intended changes are as follows:

 * The default for the [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) PermitRootLogin option will
   change from "yes" to "no".

 * Support for the legacy version 1.x of the SSH protocol will be
   disabled at compile time by default.

 * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange
   will be run-time disabled by default.

 * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys will be
   run-time disabled by default.

 * Support for the legacy v00 cert format will be removed

 * Several ciphers will be disabled by default: blowfish-cbc,
   cast128-cbc, all arcfour variants and the rijndael-cbc aliases
   for AES

 * Refusing all RSA keys smaller than 1024 bits (the current minimum
   is 768 bits)

This list reflects our current intentions, but please check the final
release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 when it is released.

Changes since OpenSSH 6.8
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security
--------

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when forwarding X11 connections with ForwardX11Trusted=no,
   connections made after ForwardX11Timeout expired could be permitted
   and no longer subject to XSECURITY restrictions because of an
   ineffective timeout check in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) coupled with "fail open"
   behaviour in the X11 server when clients attempted connections with
   expired credentials. This problem was reported by Jann Horn.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): fix weakness of agent locking (ssh-add -x) to
   password guessing by implementing an increasing failure delay,
   storing a salted hash of the password rather than the password
   itself and using a timing-safe comparison function for verifying
   unlock attempts. This problem was reported by Ryan Castellucci.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow GSSAPI host credential check to be relaxed for
   multihomed hosts via GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck option; [bz#928](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=928)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): support "ssh-keygen -lF hostname" to search
   known_hosts and print key hashes rather than full keys.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): add -D flag to leave ssh-agent in foreground without
   enabling debug mode; [bz#2381](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2381)

### [OpenSSH 6.8](txt/release-6.8)/[6.8p1](txt/release-6.8) (2015-03-18)

```

OpenSSH 6.8 was released on 2015-03-18. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 6.7
=========================

This is a major release, containing a number of new features as
well as a large internal re-factoring.

Potentially-incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): UseDNS now defaults to 'no'. Configurations that match
   against the client host name (via sshd_config or authorized_keys)
   may need to re-enable it or convert to matching against addresses.

New Features
------------

 * Much of OpenSSH's internal code has been re-factored to be more
   library-like. These changes are mostly not user-visible, but
   have greatly improved OpenSSH's testability and internal layout.

 * Add FingerprintHash option to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), and equivalent
   command-line flags to the other tools to control algorithm used
   for key fingerprints. The default changes from MD5 to SHA256 and
   format from hex to base64.

   Fingerprints now have the hash algorithm prepended. An example of
   the new format: SHA256:mVPwvezndPv/ARoIadVY98vAC0g+P/5633yTC4d/wXE
   Please note that visual host keys will also be different.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Experimental host key rotation support. Add a
   protocol extension for a server to inform a client of all its
   available host keys after authentication has completed. The client
   may record the keys in known_hosts, allowing it to upgrade to better
   host key algorithms and a server to gracefully rotate its keys.

   The client side of this is controlled by a UpdateHostkeys config
   option (default off).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a ssh_config HostbasedKeyType option to control which
   host public key types are tried during host-based authentication.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix connection-killing host key mismatch errors
   when sshd offers multiple ECDSA keys of different lengths.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when host name canonicalisation is enabled, try to
   parse host names as addresses before looking them up for
   canonicalisation. fixes [bz#2074](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2074) and avoiding needless DNS
   lookups in some cases.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Key Revocation Lists (KRLs) no longer
   require OpenSSH to be compiled with OpenSSL support.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8): Make ed25519 keys work for host based
   authentication.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): SSH protocol v.1 workaround for the Meyer, et al,
   Bleichenbacher Side Channel Attack. Fake up a bignum key before
   RSA decryption.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Remember which public keys have been used for
   authentication and refuse to accept previously-used keys.
   This allows AuthenticationMethods=publickey,publickey to require
   that users authenticate using two _different_ public keys.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add sshd_config HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes and
   PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes options to allow sshd to control what
   public key types will be accepted. Currently defaults to all.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Don't count partial authentication success as a failure
   against MaxAuthTries.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add RevokedHostKeys option for the client to allow
   text-file or KRL-based revocation of host keys.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Permit KRLs that revoke certificates by
   serial number or key ID without scoping to a particular CA.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a "Match canonical" criteria that allows ssh_config
   Match blocks to trigger only in the second config pass.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a -G option to ssh that causes it to parse its
   configuration and dump the result to stdout, similar to "sshd -T".

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Allow Match criteria to be negated. E.g. "Match !host".

 * The regression test suite has been extended to cover more OpenSSH
   features. The unit tests have been expanded and now cover key
   exchange.

Bugfixes

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): ssh-keyscan has been made much more robust again
   servers that hang or violate the SSH protocol.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Fix regression [bz#2306](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2306): Key path names were
   being lost as comment fields.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Allow ssh_config Port options set in the second config
   parse phase to be applied (they were being ignored). [bz#2286](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2286)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Tweak config re-parsing with host canonicalisation - make
   the second pass through the config files always run when host name
   canonicalisation is enabled (and not whenever the host name
   changes) [bz#2267](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2267)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Fix passing of wildcard forward bind addresses when
   connection multiplexing is in use; [bz#2324](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2324);

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Fix broken private key conversion from non-OpenSSH
   formats; [bz#2345](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2345).

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Fix KRL generation bug when multiple CAs are in
   use.

 * Various fixes to manual pages: [bz#2288](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2288), [bz#2316](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2316), [bz#2273](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2273)

Portable OpenSSH

 * Support --without-openssl at configure time

   Disables and removes dependency on OpenSSL. Many features,
   including SSH protocol 1 are not supported and the set of crypto
   options is greatly restricted. This will only work on systems
   with native arc4random or /dev/urandom.

   Considered highly experimental for now.

 * Support --without-ssh1 option at configure time

   Allows disabling support for SSH protocol 1.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix compilation on systems with IPv6 support in utmpx; [bz#2296](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2296)

 * Allow custom service name for sshd on Cygwin. Permits the use of
   multiple sshd running with different service names.

OpenSSH 6.7 was released on 2014-10-06. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:

Changes since OpenSSH 6.6
=========================

Potentially-incompatible changes

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): The default set of ciphers and MACs has been altered to
   remove unsafe algorithms. In particular, CBC ciphers and arcfour*
   are disabled by default.

   The full set of algorithms remains available if configured
   explicitly via the Ciphers and MACs sshd_config options.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Support for tcpwrappers/libwrap has been removed.

 * OpenSSH 6.5 and 6.6 have a bug that causes ~0.2% of connections
   using the curve25519-sha256@libssh.org KEX exchange method to fail
   when connecting with something that implements the specification
   correctly. OpenSSH 6.7 disables this KEX method when speaking to
   one of the affected versions.

New Features

 * Major internal refactoring to begin to make part of OpenSSH usable
   as a library. So far the wire parsing, key handling and KRL code
   has been refactored. Please note that we do not consider the API
   stable yet, nor do we offer the library in separable form.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add support for Unix domain socket forwarding.
   A remote TCP port may be forwarded to a local Unix domain socket
   and vice versa or both ends may be a Unix domain socket.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Add support for SSHFP DNS records for
   ED25519 key types.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Allow resumption of interrupted uploads.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): When rekeying, skip file/DNS lookups of the hostkey if it
   is the same as the one sent during initial key exchange; [bz#2154](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2154)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Allow explicit ::1 and 127.0.0.1 forwarding bind
   addresses when GatewayPorts=no; allows client to choose address
   family; [bz#2222](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2222)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add a sshd_config PermitUserRC option to control whether
   ~/.ssh/rc is executed, mirroring the no-user-rc authorized_keys
   option; [bz#2160](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2160)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a %C escape sequence for LocalCommand and ControlPath
   that expands to a unique identifer based on a hash of the tuple of
   (local host, remote user, hostname, port). Helps avoid exceeding
   miserly pathname limits for Unix domain sockets in multiplexing
   control paths; [bz#2220](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2220)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Make the "Too many authentication failures" message
   include the user, source address, port and protocol in a format
   similar to the authentication success / failure messages; [bz#2199](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2199)

 * Added unit and fuzz tests for refactored code. These are run
   automatically in portable OpenSSH via the "make tests" target.

Bugfixes

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix remote forwarding with the same listen port but
   different listen address.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Fix inverted test that caused PKCS#11 keys that were
   explicitly listed in ssh_config or on the commandline not to be
   preferred.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Fix bug in KRL generation: multiple consecutive
   revoked certificate serial number ranges could be serialised to an
   invalid format. Readers of a broken KRL caused by this bug will
   fail closed, so no should-have-been-revoked key will be accepted.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Reflect stdio-forward ("ssh -W host:port ...") failures in
   exit status. Previously we were always returning 0; [bz#2255](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2255)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Make Ed25519 keys' title fit properly in the
   randomart border; [bz#2247](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2247)

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): Only cleanup agent socket in the main agent process
   and not in any subprocesses it may have started (e.g. forked
   askpass). Fixes agent sockets being zapped when askpass processes
   fatal(); [bz#2236](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2236)

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): Make stdout line-buffered; saves partial output getting
   lost when ssh-add fatal()s part-way through (e.g. when listing keys
   from an agent that supports key types that ssh-add doesn't);
   [bz#2234](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2234)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): When hashing or removing hosts, don't choke on
   @revoked markers and don't remove @cert-authority markers; [bz#2241](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2241)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Don't fatal when hostname canonicalisation fails and a
   ProxyCommand is in use; continue and allow the ProxyCommand to
   connect anyway (e.g. to a host with a name outside the DNS behind
   a bastion)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): When copying local->remote fails during read, don't send
   uninitialised heap to the remote end.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Fix fatal "el_insertstr failed" errors when tab-completing
   filenames with  a single quote char somewhere in the string;
   [bz#2238](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2238)

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1): Scan for Ed25519 keys by default.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): When using VerifyHostKeyDNS with a DNSSEC resolver, down-
   convert any certificate keys to plain keys and attempt SSHFP
   resolution.  Prevents a server from skipping SSHFP lookup and
   forcing a new-hostkey dialog by offering only certificate keys.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Avoid crash at exit via NULL pointer reference; [bz#2225](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2225)

 * Fix some strict-alignment errors.

Portable OpenSSH

 * Portable OpenSSH now supports building against libressl-portable.

 * Portable OpenSSH now requires openssl 0.9.8f or greater. Older
   versions are no longer supported.

 * In the OpenSSL version check, allow fix version upgrades (but not
   downgrades. Debian bug #748150.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): On Cygwin, determine privilege separation user at runtime,
   since it may need to be a domain account.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Don't attempt to use vhangup on Linux. It doesn't work for
   non-root users, and for them it just messes up the tty settings.

 * Use CLOCK_BOOTTIME in preference to CLOCK_MONOTONIC when it is
   available. It considers time spent suspended, thereby ensuring
   timeouts (e.g. for expiring agent keys) fire correctly.  [bz#2228](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2228)

 * Add support for ed25519 to opensshd.init init script.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): On platforms that support it, use prctl() to
   prevent sftp-server from accessing /proc/self/{mem,maps}

### [OpenSSH 6.6](txt/release-6.6)/[6.6p1](txt/release-6.6) (2014-03-15)

```

OpenSSH 6.6 was released on 2014-03-15. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 6.6
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Security:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): when using environment passing with a [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)
   AcceptEnv pattern with a wildcard. OpenSSH prior to 6.6 could be
   tricked into accepting any enviornment variable that contains the
   characters before the wildcard character.

New / changed features:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): this release removes the J-PAKE authentication code.
   This code was experimental, never enabled and had been unmaintained
   for some time.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when processing Match blocks, skip 'exec' clauses other clauses
   predicates failed to match.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): if hostname canonicalisation is enabled and results in the
   destination hostname being changed, then re-parse [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) files
   using the new destination hostname. This gives 'Host' and 'Match'
   directives that use the expanded hostname a chance to be applied.

Bugfixes:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): avoid spurious "getsockname failed: Bad file descriptor" in
   ssh -W. [bz#2200](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2200), debian#738692

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow the shutdown(2) syscall in seccomp-bpf and systrace
   sandbox modes, as it is reachable if the connection is terminated
   during the pre-auth phase.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix unsigned overflow that in SSH protocol 1 bignum
   parsing. Minimum key length checks render this bug unexploitable to
   compromise SSH 1 sessions.

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): clarify behaviour of a keyword that appears in
   multiple matching Match blocks. [bz#2184](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2184)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): avoid unnecessary hostname lookups when canonicalisation is
   disabled. [bz#2205](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2205)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): avoid sandbox violation crashes in GSSAPI code by caching
   the supported list of GSSAPI mechanism OIDs before entering the
   sandbox. [bz#2107](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2107)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix possible crashes in SOCKS4 parsing caused by assumption
   that the SOCKS username is nul-terminated.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix regression for UsePrivilegedPort=yes when BindAddress is
   not specified.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix memory leak in ECDSA signature verification.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix matching of 'Host' directives in [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) files
   to be case-insensitive again (regression in 6.5).

Portable OpenSSH:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): don't fatal if the FreeBSD Capsicum is offered by the
   system headers and libc but is not supported by the kernel.
 * Fix build using the HP-UX compiler.

### [OpenSSH 6.5](txt/release-6.5)/[6.5p1](txt/release-6.5) (2014-01-30)

```

Changes since OpenSSH 6.4
=========================

This is a feature-focused release.

New features:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add support for key exchange using elliptic-curve
   Diffie Hellman in Daniel Bernstein's Curve25519. This key exchange
   method is the default when both the client and server support it.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add support for Ed25519 as a public key type.
   Ed25519 is a elliptic curve signature scheme that offers
   better security than ECDSA and DSA and good performance. It may be
   used for both user and host keys.

 * Add a new private key format that uses a bcrypt KDF to better
   protect keys at rest. This format is used unconditionally for
   Ed25519 keys, but may be requested when generating or saving
   existing keys of other types via the -o [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) option.
   We intend to make the new format the default in the near future.
   Details of the new format are in the PROTOCOL.key file.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add a new transport cipher
   "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com" that combines Daniel Bernstein's
   ChaCha20 stream cipher and Poly1305 MAC to build an authenticated
   encryption mode. Details are in the PROTOCOL.chacha20poly1305 file.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Refuse RSA keys from old proprietary clients and
   servers that use the obsolete RSA+MD5 signature scheme. It will
   still be possible to connect with these clients/servers but only
   DSA keys will be accepted, and OpenSSH will refuse connection
   entirely in a future release.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Refuse old proprietary clients and servers that
   use a weaker key exchange hash calculation.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Increase the size of the Diffie-Hellman groups requested
   for each symmetric key size. New values from NIST Special
   Publication 800-57 with the upper limit specified by [RFC4419](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4419).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): Support PKCS#11 tokens that only provide
   X.509 certs instead of raw public keys (requested as [bz#1908](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1908)).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) "Match" keyword that allows
   conditional configuration to be applied by matching on hostname,
   user and result of arbitrary commands.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add support for client-side hostname canonicalisation
   using a set of DNS suffixes and rules in [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5). This
   allows unqualified names to be canonicalised to fully-qualified
   domain names to eliminate ambiguity when looking up keys in
   known_hosts or checking host certificate names.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): Add the ability to whitelist and/or blacklist sftp
   protocol requests by name.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): Add a sftp "fsync@openssh.com" to support calling
   fsync(2) on an open file handle.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add a [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) PermitTTY to disallow TTY allocation,
   mirroring the longstanding no-pty authorized_keys option.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Add a ssh_config ProxyUseFDPass option that supports the
   use of ProxyCommands that establish a connection and then pass a
   connected file descriptor back to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1). This allows the
   ProxyCommand to exit rather than staying around to transfer data.

Bugfixes:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Fix potential stack exhaustion caused by nested
   certificates.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): [bz#1211](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1211): make BindAddress work with UsePrivilegedPort.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): [bz#2137](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2137): fix the progress meter for resumed transfer.

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): [bz#2187](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2187): do not request smartcard PIN when removing
   keys from ssh-agent.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): [bz#2139](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2139): fix re-exec fallback when original sshd binary
   cannot be executed.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Make relative-specified certificate expiry times
   relative to current time and not the validity start time.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): [bz#2161](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2161): fix AuthorizedKeysCommand inside a Match block.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): [bz#2129](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2129): symlinking a file would incorrectly canonicalise
   the target path.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): [bz#2175](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2175): fix a use-after-free in the PKCS#11 agent
   helper executable.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Improve logging of sessions to include the user name,
   remote host and port, the session type (shell, command, etc.) and
   allocated TTY (if any).

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): [bz#1297](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1297): tell the client (via a debug message) when
   their preferred listen address has been overridden by the
   server's GatewayPorts setting.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): [bz#2162](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2162): include report port in bad protocol banner
   message.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): [bz#2163](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2163): fix memory leak in error path in do_readdir().

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): [bz#2171](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2171): don't leak file descriptor on error.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Include the local address and port in "Connection from
   ..." message (only shown at loglevel>=verbose).

Portable OpenSSH:

 * Please note that this is the last version of Portable OpenSSH that
   will support versions of OpenSSL prior to 0.9.6. Support (i.e.
   SSH_OLD_EVP) will be removed following the 6.5p1 release.

 * Portable OpenSSH will attempt compile and link as a Position
   Independent Executable on Linux, OS X and OpenBSD on recent gcc-
   like compilers. Other platforms and older/other compilers may
   request this using the --with-pie configure flag.

 * A number of other toolchain-related hardening options are used
   automatically if available, including -ftrapv to abort on signed
   integer overflow and options to write-protect dynamic linking
   information.  The use of these options may be disabled using the
   --without-hardening configure flag.

 * If the toolchain supports it, one of the -fstack-protector-strong,
   -fstack-protector-all or -fstack-protector compilation flag are
   used to add guards to mitigate attacks based on stack overflows.
   The use of these options may be disabled using the
   --without-stackprotect configure option.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add support for pre-authentication sandboxing using the
   Capsicum API introduced in FreeBSD 10.

 * Switch to a ChaCha20-based arc4random() PRNG for platforms that do
   not provide their own.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): [bz#2156](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2156): restore Linux oom_adj setting when handling
   SIGHUP to maintain behaviour over retart.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): [bz#2032](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2032): use local username in krb5_kuserok check rather
   than full client name which may be of form user@REALM.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Test for both the presence of ECC NID numbers in
   OpenSSL and that they actually work. Fedora (at least) has
   NID_secp521r1 that doesn't work.

 * [bz#2173](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2173): use pkg-config --libs to include correct -L location for
   libedit.

### [OpenSSH 6.3](txt/release-6.3)/[6.3p1](txt/release-6.3) (2013-09-13)

```

Changes since OpenSSH 6.2
=========================

This release is predominantly a bugfix release:

Features:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) support to [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8); allows encrypted hostkeys,
   or hostkeys on smartcards.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow optional time-based rekeying via a second argument
   to the existing RekeyLimit option. RekeyLimit is now supported in
   sshd_config as well as on the client.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): standardise logging of information during user authentication.

   The presented key/cert and the remote username (if available) is now
   logged in the authentication success/failure message on the same log
   line as the local username, remote host/port and protocol in use.
   Certificates contents and the key fingerprint of the signing CA are
   logged too.

   Including all relevant information on a single line simplifies log
   analysis as it is no longer necessary to relate information scattered
   across multiple log entries.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add the ability to query which ciphers, MAC algorithms, key
   types and key exchange methods are supported in the binary.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): support ProxyCommand=- to allow support cases where stdin and
   stdout already point to the proxy.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): allow IdentityFile=none

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add -E option to ssh and sshd to append debugging logs
   to a specified file instead of stderr or syslog.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): add support for resuming partial downloads using the "reget"
   command and on the sftp commandline or on the "get" commandline using
   the "-a" (append) option.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): add an "IgnoreUnknown" configuration option to selectively
   suppress errors arising from unknown configuration directives.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add support for submethods to be appended to required
   authentication methods listed via AuthenticationMethods.

Bugfixes:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix refusal to accept certificate if a key of a different type
   to the CA key appeared in authorized_keys before the CA key.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Use a monotonic time source for timers so
   that things like keepalives and rekeying will work properly over clock
   steps.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): update progressmeter when data is acknowledged, not when it's
   sent. [bz#2108](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2108)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): improve error messages when the current user does
   not exist in /etc/passwd; [bz#2125](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2125)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): reset the order in which public keys are tried after partial
   authentication success.

 * [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): clean up socket files after SIGINT when in debug mode;
   [bz#2120](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2120)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and others: avoid confusing error messages in the case of broken
   system resolver configurations; [bz#2122](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2122)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): set TCP nodelay for connections started with -N; [bz#2124](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2124)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): correct manual for permission requirements on ~/.ssh/config;

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): when running sshd -D, close stderr unless we have explicitly
   requested logging to stderr. [bz#1976](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1976),

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix incomplete bzero; [bz#2100](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2100)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): log and error and exit if ChrootDirectory is specified and
   running without root privileges.

 * Many improvements to the regression test suite. In particular log files
   are now saved from ssh and sshd after failures.

 * Fix a number of memory leaks. [bz#1967](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1967) [bz#2096](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2096) and others

     have a native crypt() function; [bz#2112](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2112)
   * Test for fd_mask, howmany and NFDBITS rather than trying to enumerate
     the plaforms that don't have them. [bz#2085](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2085)

### [OpenSSH 6.2](txt/release-6.2)/[6.2p1](txt/release-6.2) (2013-03-22)

```

Changes since OpenSSH 6.1
=========================

This release introduces a number of new features:

Features:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Added support for AES-GCM authenticated encryption in
   SSH protocol 2. The new cipher is available as aes128-gcm@openssh.com
   and aes256-gcm@openssh.com. It uses an identical packet format to the
   AES-GCM mode specified in [RFC 5647](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5647), but uses simpler and different
   selection rules during key exchange.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Added support for encrypt-then-mac (EtM) MAC modes
   for SSH protocol 2. These modes alter the packet format and compute
   the MAC over the packet length and encrypted packet rather than over
   the plaintext data. These modes are considered more secure and are
   used by default when available.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Added support for the UMAC-128 MAC as
   "umac-128@openssh.com" and "umac-128-etm@openssh.com". The latter
   being an encrypt-then-mac mode.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Added support for multiple required authentication in SSH
   protocol 2 via an AuthenticationMethods option. This option lists
   one or more comma-separated lists of authentication method names.
   Successful completion of all the methods in any list is required for
   authentication to complete. This allows, for example, requiring a
   user having to authenticate via public key or GSSAPI before they
   are offered password authentication.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)/[ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Added support for Key Revocation Lists
   (KRLs), a compact binary format to represent lists of revoked keys
   and certificates that take as little as one bit per certificate when
   revoking by serial number. KRLs may be generated using [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1)
   and are loaded into [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) via the existing RevokedKeys sshd_config
   option.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): IdentitiesOnly now applies to keys obtained from a
   PKCS11Provider. This allows control of which keys are offered from
   tokens using IdentityFile.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)'s AllowTcpForwarding now accepts "local"
   and "remote" in addition to its previous "yes"/"no" keywords to allow
   the server to specify whether just local or remote TCP forwarding is
   enabled.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Added a [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) option AuthorizedKeysCommand to
   support fetching authorized_keys from a command in addition to (or
   instead of) from the filesystem. The command is run under an account
   specified by an AuthorizedKeysCommandUser [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) option.

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): Now supports a -d option to allow the starting
   directory to be something other than the user's home directory.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Now allows fingerprinting of keys hosted in PKCS#11
   tokens using "ssh-keygen -lD pkcs11_provider".

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): When SSH protocol 2 only is selected (the default), [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
   now immediately sends its SSH protocol banner to the server without
   waiting to receive the server's banner, saving time when connecting.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Added ~v and ~V escape sequences to raise and lower the
   logging level respectively.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Made the escape command help (~?) context sensitive so that
   only commands that will work in the current session are shown.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): When deleting host lines from known_hosts using
   "ssh-keygen -R host", [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) now prints details of which lines
   were removed.

Bugfixes:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Force a clean shutdown of ControlMaster client sessions when
   the ~. escape sequence is used. This means that ~. should now work in
   mux clients even if the server is no longer responding.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Correctly detect errors during local TCP forward setup in
   multiplexed clients. [bz#2055](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2055)

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): Made deleting explicit keys "ssh-add -d" symmetric with
   adding keys with respect to certificates. It now tries to delete the
   corresponding certificate and respects the -k option to allow deleting
   of the key only.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): Fix a number of parsing and command-editing bugs, including
   [bz#1956](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1956)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): When muxmaster is run with -N, ensured that it shuts down
   gracefully when a client sends it "-O stop" rather than hanging around.
   [bz#1985](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1985)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): When screening moduli candidates, append to the file
   rather than overwriting to allow resumption. [bz#1957](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1957)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Record "Received disconnect" messages at ERROR rather than
   INFO priority. [bz#2057](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2057).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Loudly warn if explicitly-provided private key is unreadable.
   [bz#1981](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1981)

Portable OpenSSH:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): The Linux seccomp-filter sandbox is now supported on ARM
   platforms where the kernel supports it.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): The seccomp-filter sandbox will not be enabled if the system
   headers support it at compile time, regardless of whether it can be
   enabled then. If the run-time system does not support seccomp-filter,
   sshd will fall back to the rlimit pseudo-sandbox.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Don't link in the Kerberos libraries. They aren't necessary
   on the client, just on [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). [bz#2072](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2072)

 * Fix GSSAPI linking on Solaris, which uses a differently-named GSSAPI
   library. [bz#2073](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2073)

 * Fix compilation on systems with openssl-1.0.0-fips.

 * Fix a number of errors in the RPM spec files.

implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.9
=========================

This is primarily a bugfix release.

Features:

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Add optional checkpoints for moduli screening
 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1): new -k option to load plain keys (skipping certificates)
 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Add wildcard support to PermitOpen, allowing things like
   "PermitOpen localhost:*".  [bz #1857](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1857)
 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): support for cancelling local and remote port forwards via the
   multiplex socket. Use ssh -O cancel -L xx:xx:xx -R yy:yy:yy user@host"
   to request the cancellation of the specified forwardings
 * support cancellation of local/dynamic forwardings from ~C commandline

Bugfixes:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): ensure that $DISPLAY contains only valid characters before
   using it to extract xauth data so that it can't be used to play local
   shell metacharacter games.
 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): unbreak remote portforwarding with dynamic allocated listen ports
 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): uppress adding '--' to remote commandlines when the first
   argument does not start with '-'. saves breakage on some
   difficult-to-upgrade embedded/router platforms
 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix typo in IPQoS parsing: there is no "AF14" class,
   but there is an "AF21" class
 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): do not permit SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST/ACCEPT during
   rekeying
 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): skip attempting to create ~/.ssh when -F is passed
 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): unbreak stdio forwarding when ControlPersist is in use; [bz#1943](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1943)
 * [sshd(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.1): send tty break to pty master instead of (probably already
   closed) slave side; [bz#1859](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1859)
 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): silence error spam for "ls */foo" in directory with files;
   [bz#1683](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1683)
 * Fixed a number of memory and file descriptor leaks

Portable OpenSSH:

 * Add a new privilege separation sandbox implementation for Linux's
   new seccomp sandbox, automatically enabled on platforms that support
   it. (Note: privilege separation sandboxing is still experimental)
 * Fix compilation problems on FreeBSD, where libutil contained openpty()
   but not login().
 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): don't fail in -A on platforms that don't support ECC
 * Add optional support for LDNS, a BSD licensed DNS resolver library
   which supports DNSSEC
 * Relax OpenSSL version check to allow running OpenSSH binaries on
   systems with OpenSSL libraries with a newer "fix" or "patch" level
   than the binaries were originally compiled on (previous check only
   allowed movement within "patch" releases). [bz#1991](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1991)
 * Fix builds using contributed Redhat spec file. [bz#1992](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1992)

### [OpenSSH 5.9](txt/release-5.9)/[5.9p1](txt/release-5.9) (2011-09-06)

```

OpenSSH 5.9 was released on 2011-09-06. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.8
=========================

Features:

 * Introduce sandboxing of the pre-auth privsep child using an optional
   [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) "UsePrivilegeSeparation=sandbox" mode that enables
   mandatory restrictions on the syscalls the privsep child can perform.
   This intention is to prevent a compromised privsep child from being
   used to attack other hosts (by opening sockets and proxying) or
   probing local kernel attack surface.

   Three concrete sandbox implementation are provided (selected at
   configure time): systrace, seatbelt and rlimit.

   The systrace sandbox uses systrace(4) in unsupervised "fast-path"
   mode, where a list of permitted syscalls is supplied. Any syscall not
   on the list results in SIGKILL being sent to the privsep child. Note
   that this requires a kernel with the new SYSTR_POLICY_KILL option
   (only OpenBSD has this mode at present).

   The seatbelt sandbox uses OS X/Darwin sandbox(7) facilities with a
   strict (kSBXProfilePureComputation) policy that disables access to
   filesystem and network resources.

   The rlimit sandbox is a fallback choice for platforms that don't
   support a better one; it uses setrlimit() to reset the hard-limit
   of file descriptors and processes to zero, which should prevent
   the privsep child from forking or opening new network connections.

   Sandboxing of the privilege separated child process is currently
   experimental but should become the default in a future release.
   Native sandboxes for other platforms are welcome (e.g. Capsicum,
   Linux pid/net namespaces, etc.)

 * Add new SHA256-based HMAC transport integrity modes from
   <http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-dbider-sha2-mac-for-ssh-02.txt>
   These modes are hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-256-96, hmac-sha2-512,
   and hmac-sha2-512-96, and are available by default in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and
   [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)

 * The pre-authentication [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) privilege separation slave process
   now logs via a socket shared with the master process, avoiding the
   need to maintain /dev/log inside the chroot.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now warns when a server refuses X11 forwarding

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)'s AuthorizedKeysFile now accepts multiple paths,
   separated by whitespace. The undocumented AuthorizedKeysFile2
   option is deprecated (though the default for AuthorizedKeysFile
   includes .ssh/authorized_keys2)

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5): similarly deprecate UserKnownHostsFile2 and
   GlobalKnownHostsFile2 by making UserKnownHostsFile and
   GlobalKnownHostsFile accept multiple options and default to
   include known_hosts2

 * Retain key comments when loading v.2 keys. These will be visible
   in "ssh-add -l" and other places. [bz#439](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=439)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): set IPv6 traffic class from IPQoS (as well as
   IPv4 ToS/DSCP). [bz#1855](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1855)

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5)'s ControlPath option now expands %L to the host
   portion of the destination host name.

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) "Host" options now support negated Host matching, e.g.

     Host *.example.org !c.example.org
        User mekmitasdigoat

   Will match "a.example.org", "b.example.org", but not "c.example.org"

 * [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5): a new RequestTTY option provides control over when a
   TTY is requested for a connection, similar to the existing -t/-tt/-T
   [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) commandline options.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): allow GSSAPI authentication to detect when a server-side
   failure causes authentication failure and don't count such failures
   against MaxAuthTries; [bz#1244](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1244)

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): Add -A option. For each of the key types (rsa1, rsa,
   dsa and ecdsa) for which host keys do not exist, generate the host
   keys with the default key file path, an empty passphrase, default
   bits for the key type, and default comment. This is useful for
   system initialisation scripts.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Allow graceful shutdown of multiplexing: request that a mux
   server removes its listener socket and refuse future multiplexing
   requests but don't kill existing connections. This may be requested
   using "ssh -O stop ..."

 * [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1) now accepts keys piped from standard input. E.g.
   "ssh-add - < /path/to/key"

 * [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8) now signs hostbased authentication
   challenges correctly using ECDSA keys; [bz#1858](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1858)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): document that sftp accepts square brackets to delimit
   addresses (useful for IPv6); [bz#1847](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1847)a

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): when using session multiplexing, the master process will
   change its process title to reflect the control path in use and
   when a ControlPersist-ed master is waiting to close; [bz#1883](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1883) and
   [bz#1911](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1911)

 * Other minor bugs fixed: 1849 1861 1862 1869 1875 1878 1879 1892
   1900 1905 1913

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Fix a compilation error in the SELinux support code. [bz#1851](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1851)

 * This release removes support for ssh-rand-helper. OpenSSH now
   obtains its random numbers directly from OpenSSL or from
   a PRNGd/EGD instance specified at configure time.

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now resets the SELinux process execution context before
   executing passwd for password changes; [bz#1891](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891)

 * Since gcc >= 4.x ignores all -Wno-options options, test only the
   corresponding -W-option when trying to determine whether it is
   accepted; [bz#1901](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1901)

 * Add ECDSA key generation to the Cygwin ssh-{host,user}-config
   scripts.

 * Updated .spec and init files for Linux; [bz#1920](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1920)

 * Improved SELinux error messages in context change failures and
   suppress error messages when attempting to change from the
   "unconfined_t" type; [bz#1924](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1924) [bz#1919](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1919)

 * Fix build errors on platforms without dlopen(); [bz#1929](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1929)

### [OpenSSH 5.8p2](txt/release-5.8p2) (2011-05-03)

```

Portable OpenSSH 5.8p2 was released on 2011-05-03. It will be available
from the mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.8p1
===========================

Security:

 * Fix local private host key compromise on platforms without host-
   level randomness support (e.g. /dev/random) reported by Tomas Mraz

   On hosts that did not have a randomness source configured in
   OpenSSL and were not configured to use EGD/PRNGd (using the
   --with-prngd-socket configure option), the ssh-rand-helper command
   was being implicitly executed by ssh-keysign with open file
   descriptors to the host private keys. An attacker could use
   ptrace(2) to attach to ssh-rand-helper and exfiltrate the keys.

   Most modern operating systems are not vulnerable. In particular,
   *BSD, Linux, OS X and Cygwin do not use ssh-rand-helper.

   A full advisory for this issue is available at:
   <http://www.openssh.com/txt/portable-keysign-rand-helper.adv>

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Fix compilation failure when enabling SELinux support.

 * Revised Cygwin ssh-{host,user}-config that include ECDSA key
   support.

 * Revised Cygwin ssh-host-config to be more thorough in error checking
   and reporting.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.7
=========================

Security:

 * Fix vulnerability in legacy certificate signing introduced in
   OpenSSH-5.6 and found by Mateusz Kocielski.

   Legacy certificates signed by OpenSSH 5.6 or 5.7 included data from
   the stack in place of a random nonce field. The contents of the stack
   do not appear to contain private data at this point, but this cannot
   be stated with certainty for all platform, library and compiler
   combinations. In particular, there exists a risk that some bytes from
   the privileged CA key may be accidentally included.

   A full advisory for this issue is available at:
   <http://www.openssh.com/txt/legacy-cert.adv>

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Fix compilation failure when enableing SELinux support.

 * Do not attempt to call SELinux functions when SELinux is disabled.

### [OpenSSH 5.7](txt/release-5.7)/[5.7p1](txt/release-5.7) (2011-01-24)

```

OpenSSH 5.7 was released on 2011-01-24. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.6
=========================

Features:

 * Implement Elliptic Curve Cryptography modes for key exchange (ECDH)
   and host/user keys (ECDSA) as specified by [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656). ECDH and ECDSA
   offer better performance than plain DH and DSA at the same equivalent
   symmetric key length, as well as much shorter keys.

   Only the mandatory sections of [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656) are implemented, specifically
   the three REQUIRED curves nistp256, nistp384 and nistp521 and only
   ECDH and ECDSA. Point compression (optional in [RFC5656](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656)) is NOT
   implemented.

   Certificate host and user keys using the new ECDSA key types are
   supported - an ECDSA key may be certified, and an ECDSA key may act
   as a CA to sign certificates.

   ECDH in a 256 bit curve field is the preferred key agreement
   algorithm when both the client and server support it. ECDSA host
   keys are preferred when learning a host's keys for the first time,
   or can be learned using [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1).

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1)/[sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): add a protocol extension to support a hard
   link operation. It is available through the "ln" command in the
   client. The old "ln" behaviour of creating a symlink is available
   using its "-s" option or through the preexisting "symlink" command

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): Add a new -3 option to scp: Copies between two remote hosts
   are transferred through the local host.  Without this option the
   data is copied directly between the two remote hosts.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): automatically order the hostkeys requested by the client
   based on which hostkeys are already recorded in known_hosts. This
   avoids hostkey warnings when connecting to servers with new ECDSA
   keys, since these are now preferred when learning hostkeys for the
   first time.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a new IPQoS option to specify arbitrary
   TOS/DSCP/QoS values instead of hardcoding lowdelay/throughput.
   [bz#1733](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1733)

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): the sftp client is now significantly faster at performing
   directory listings, using OpenBSD glob(3) extensions to preserve
   the results of stat(3) operations performed in the course of its
   execution rather than performing expensive round trips to fetch
   them again afterwards.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): "atomically" create the listening mux socket by binding it on
   a temporary name and then linking it into position after listen() has
   succeeded. This allows the mux clients to determine that the server
   socket is either ready or stale without races. stale server sockets
   are now automatically removed. (also fixes [bz#1711](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1711))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): add a KexAlgorithms knob to the client and server
   configuration to allow selection of which key exchange methods are
   used by [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) and their order of preference.

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1)/[scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): factor out bandwidth limiting code from [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) into
   a generic bandwidth limiter that can be attached using the atomicio
   callback mechanism and use it to add a bandwidth limit option to
   [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1). [bz#1147](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1147)

BugFixes:

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)/[ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1): honour $TMPDIR for client xauth and ssh-agent
   temporary directories. [bz#1809](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1809)

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): avoid NULL deref on receiving a channel request on an unknown
   or invalid channel; [bz#1842](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1842)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove a debug() that pollutes stderr on client connecting
   to a server in debug mode; [bz#1719](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1719)

 * [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1): pass through ssh command-line flags and options when doing
   remote-remote transfers, e.g. to enable agent forwarding which is
   particularly useful in this case; [bz#1837](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1837)

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8): umask should be parsed as octal

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): escape '[' in filename tab-completion

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): Typo in confirmation message.  [bz#1827](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1827)

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): prevent free() of string in .rodata when overriding
   AuthorizedKeys in a Match block

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Use default shell /bin/sh if $SHELL is ""

### [OpenSSH 5.6](txt/release-5.6)/[5.6p1](txt/release-5.6) (2010-08-23)

```

OpenSSH 5.6 was released on 2010-08-23. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.5
=========================

Features:

 * Added a ControlPersist option to [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) that automatically
   starts a background [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) multiplex master when connecting. This
   connection can stay alive indefinitely, or can be set to
   automatically close after a user-specified duration of inactivity.

 * Hostbased authentication may now use certificate host keys. CA keys
   must be specified in a known_hosts file using the @cert-authority
   marker as described in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8).

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) now supports signing certificate using a CA key that
   has been stored in a PKCS#11 token.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) will now log the hostname and address that we connected to at
   LogLevel=verbose after authentication is successful to mitigate
   "phishing" attacks by servers with trusted keys that accept
   authentication silently and automatically before presenting fake
   password/passphrase prompts.

   Note that, for such an attack to be successful, the user must have
   disabled StrictHostKeyChecking (enabled by default) or an attacker
   must have access to a trusted host key for the destination server.

 * Expand %h to the hostname in ssh_config Hostname options. While this
   sounds useless, it is actually handy for working with unqualified
   hostnames:

     Host *.*
        Hostname %h
     Host *
        Hostname %h.example.org

 * Allow [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) to import (-i) and export (-e) of PEM and PKCS#8
   keys in addition to [RFC4716](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716) (SSH.COM) encodings via a new -m option
   ([bz#1749](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1749))

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will now queue debug messages for bad ownership or
   permissions on the user's keyfiles encountered during authentication
   and will send them after authentication has successfully completed.
   These messages may be viewed in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) at LogLevel=debug or higher.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) connection multiplexing now supports remote forwarding with
   dynamic port allocation and can report the allocated port back to
   the user:

     LPORT=`ssh -S muxsocket -R0:localhost:25 -O forward somehost`

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now supports indirection in matching of principal names
   listed in certificates. By default, if a certificate has an
   embedded principals list then the username on the server must match
   one of the names in the list for it to be accepted for
   authentication.

   [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now has a new AuthorizedPrincipalsFile option to specify a
   file containing a list of names that may be accepted in place of the
   username when authorizing a certificate trusted via the
   [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) TrustedCAKeys option. Similarly, authentication
   using a CA trusted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys now accepts a
   principals="name1[,name2,...]" to specify a list of permitted names.

   If either option is absent, the current behaviour of requiring the
   username to appear in principals continues to apply. These options
   are useful for role accounts, disjoint account namespaces and
   "user@realm"-style naming policies in certificates.

 * Additional [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) options are now valid inside Match blocks:

     AuthorizedKeysFile
     AuthorizedPrincipalsFile
     HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly
     PermitTunnel

 * Revised the format of certificate keys. The new format, identified as
   ssh-{dss,rsa}-cert-v01@openssh.com includes the following changes:

     - Adding a serial number field. This may be specified by the CA at
       the time of certificate signing.

     - Moving the nonce field to the beginning of the certificate where
       it can better protect against chosen-prefix attacks on the
       signature hash (currently infeasible against the SHA1 hash used)

     - Renaming the "constraints" field to "critical options"

     - Addng a new non-critical "extensions" field. The "permit-*"
       options are now extensions, rather than critical options to
       permit non-OpenSSH implementation of this key format to degrade
       gracefully when encountering keys with options they do not
       recognize.

   The older format is still supported for authentication and may still
   be used when signing certificates (use "ssh-keygen -t v00 ...").
   The v00 format, introduced in OpenSSH 5.4, will be supported for at
   least one year from this release, after which it will be deprecated
   and removed.

BugFixes:

 * The PKCS#11 code now retries a lookup for a private key if there is
   no matching key with CKA_SIGN attribute enabled; this fixes fixes
   MuscleCard support ([bz#1736](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1736))

 * Unbreak strdelim() skipping past quoted strings ([bz#1757](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1757)). For
   example, the following directive was not parsed correctly:

       AllowUsers "blah blah" blah

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix swapped args in upload_dir_internal(), breaking
   recursive upload depth checks and causing verbose printing of
   transfers to always be turned on ([bz#1797](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1797))

 * Fix a longstanding problem where if you suspend [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) at the
   password/passphrase prompt the terminal mode is not restored.

   returned for C_GetAttributValue ([bz#1773](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1773))

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix ls in working directories that contain globbing
   characters in their pathnames ([bz#1655](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1655))

 * Print warning for missing home directory when ChrootDirectory=none
   ([bz#1564](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564))

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1): fix a memory leak in do_realpath() error path ([bz#1771](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1771))

 * ssk-keygen(1): Standardise error messages when attempting to open
   private key files to include "progname: filename: error reason"
   ([bz#1783](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1783))

 * Replace verbose and overflow-prone Linebuf code with
   read_keyfile_line() ([bz#1565](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565))

 * Include the user name on "subsystem request for ..." log messages

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): remove hardcoded limit of 100 permitopen clauses
   and port forwards per direction ([bz#1327](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1327))

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): ignore stderr output from subsystems to avoid hangs if a
   subsystem or shell initialisation writes to stderr ([bz#1750](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1750))

 * Skip the initial check for access with an empty password when
   PermitEmptyPasswords=no ([bz#1638](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1638))

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): fix logspam when key options (from="..." especially) deny
   non-matching keys ([bz#1765](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1765))

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): display a more helpful error message when $HOME is
   inaccessible while trying to create .ssh directory ([bz#1740](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1740))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): fix hang when terminating a mux slave using ~. ([bz#1758](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1758))

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1): refuse to generate keys longer than
   OPENSSL_[RD]SA_MAX_MODULUS_BITS, since we would refuse to use
   them anyway ([bz#1516](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1516))

 * Suppress spurious tty warning when using -O and stdin is not a tty
   ([bz#1746](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1746))

 * Kill channel when pty allocation requests fail. Fixed stuck client
   if the server refuses pty allocation ([bz#1698](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1698))

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): increase the maximum username length for login recording
   to 512 characters ([bz#1579](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1579))

 * Initialize the values to be returned from PAM to sane values in
   case the PAM method doesn't write to them. ([bz#1795](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1795))

 * Let configure find OpenSSL libraries in a lib64 subdirectory.

### [OpenSSH 5.4](txt/release-5.4)/[5.4p1](txt/release-5.4) (2010-03-08)

```

OpenSSH 5.4 was released on 2010-03-08. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0

continued support of the project, especially those who contributed code
or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the project.
More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

This is a major feature and bugfix release.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.3
=========================

Features:

 * After a transition period of about 10 years, this release disables
   SSH protocol 1 by default. Clients and servers that need to use the
   legacy protocol must explicitly enable it in ssh_config / sshd_config
   or on the command-line.

 * Remove the libsectok/OpenSC-based smartcard code and add support for
   PKCS#11 tokens. This support is automatically enabled on all
   platforms that support dlopen(3) and was inspired by patches written
   by Alon Bar-Lev. Details in the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1) manpages.

 * Add support for certificate authentication of users and hosts using a
   new, minimal OpenSSH certificate format (not X.509). Certificates
   contain a public key, identity information and some validity
   constraints and are signed with a standard SSH public key using
   [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1). CA keys may be marked as trusted in authorized_keys
   or via a TrustedUserCAKeys option in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) (for user
   authentication), or in known_hosts (for host authentication).

   Documentation for certificate support may be found in [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1),
   [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) and [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and a description of the protocol extensions in
   PROTOCOL.certkeys.

 * Added a 'netcat mode' to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1): "ssh -W host:port ..." This connects
   stdio on the client to a single port forward on the server. This
   allows, for example, using ssh as a ProxyCommand to route connections
   via intermediate servers. [bz#1618](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1618)

 * Add the ability to revoke keys in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) and [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1). User keys may
   be revoked using a new [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) option "RevokedKeys". Host keys
   are revoked through known_hosts (details in the [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) man page).
   Revoked keys cannot be used for user or host authentication and will
   trigger a warning if used.

 * Rewrite the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) multiplexing support to support non-blocking
   operation of the mux master, improve the resilience of the master to
   malformed messages sent to it by the slave and add support for
   requesting port- forwardings via the multiplex protocol. The new
   stdio-to-local forward mode ("ssh -W host:port ...") is also
   supported. The revised multiplexing protocol is documented in the
   file PROTOCOL.mux in the source distribution.

 * Add a 'read-only' mode to [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) that disables open in write
   mode and all other fs-modifying protocol methods. [bz#430](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430)

 * Allow setting an explicit umask on the [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) commandline to
   override whatever default the user has. [bz#1229](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1229)

 * Many improvements to the [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) client, many of which were
   implemented by Carlos Silva through the Google Summer of Code
   program:
   - Support the "-h" (human-readable units) flag for ls
   - Implement tab-completion of commands, local and remote filenames
   - Support most of [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1)'s commandline arguments in [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1), as a
     first step towards making [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) a drop-in replacement for [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1).
     Note that the rarely-used "-P sftp_server_path" option has been
     moved to "-D sftp_server_path" to make way for "-P port" to match
     [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1).
   - Add recursive transfer support for get/put and on the commandline

 * New RSA keys will be generated with a public exponent of RSA_F4 ==
   (2**16)+1 == 65537 instead of the previous value 35.

 * Passphrase-protected SSH protocol 2 private keys are now protected
   with AES-128 instead of 3DES. This applied to newly-generated keys
   as well as keys that are reencrypted (e.g. by changing their
   passphrase).

Bugfixes:

 * Hold authentication debug messages until after successful
   authentication. Fixes a minor information leak of environment
   variables specified in authorized_keys if an attacker happens to
   know the public key in use.
 * When using ChrootDirectory, make sure we test for the existence of
   the user's shell inside the chroot and not outside ([bz#1679](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1679))
 * Cache user and group name lookups in sftp-server using
   user_from_[ug]id(3) to improve performance on hosts where these
   operations are slow (e.g. NIS or LDAP). [bz#1495](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495)
 * Fix problem that prevented passphrase reading from being interrupted
   in some circumstances; [bz#1590](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1590)
 * Ignore and log any Protocol 1 keys where the claimed size is not
   equal to the actual size.
 * Make HostBased authentication work with a ProxyCommand. [bz#1569](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1569)
 * Avoid run-time failures when specifying hostkeys via a relative
   path by prepending the current working directory in these cases.
   [bz#1290](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290)
 * Do not prompt for a passphrase if we fail to open a keyfile, and log
   the reason why the open failed to debug. [bz#1693](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1693)
 * Document that the PubkeyAuthentication directive is allowed in a
   [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) Match block. [bz#1577](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577)
 * When converting keys, truncate key comments at 72 chars as per
   [RFC4716](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4716). [bz#1630](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1630)
 * Do not allow logins if /etc/nologin exists but is not readable by the
   user logging in.
 * Output a debug log if [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) can't open an existing authorized_keys.
   [bz#1694](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1694)
 * Quell tc[gs]etattr warnings when forcing a tty (ssh -tt), since we
   usually don't actually have a tty to read/set; [bz#1686](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1686)
 * Prevent sftp from crashing when given a "-" without a command.
   Also, allow whitespace to follow a "-". [bz#1691](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1691)
 * After sshd receives a SIGHUP, ignore subsequent HUPs while sshd
   re-execs itself. Prevents two HUPs in quick succession from resulting
   in sshd dying. [bz#1692](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1692)
 * Clarify in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) that StrictModes does not apply to
   ChrootDirectory. Permissions and ownership are always checked when
   chrooting. [bz#1532](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532)
 * Set close-on-exec on various descriptors so they don't get leaked to
   child processes. [bz#1643](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1643)
 * Fix very rare race condition in x11/agent channel allocation: don't
   read after the end of the select read/write fdset and make sure a
   reused FD is not touched before the pre-handlers are called.
 * Fix incorrect exit status when multiplexing and channel ID 0 is
   recycled. [bz#1570](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1570)
 * Fail with an error when an attempt is made to connect to a server
   with ForceCommand=internal-sftp with a shell session (i.e. not a
   subsystem session). Avoids stuck client when attempting to ssh to
   such a service. [bz#1606](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1606):
 * Warn but do not fail if stat()ing the subsystem binary fails. This
   helps with chrootdirectory+forcecommand=sftp-server and restricted
   shells. [bz #1599](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599)
 * Change "Connecting to host..." message to "Connected to host."
   and delay it until after the sftp protocol connection has been
   established. Avoids confusing sequence of messages when the
   underlying ssh connection experiences problems. [bz#1588](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588)
 * Use the HostKeyAlias rather than the hostname specified on the
   commandline when prompting for passwords. [bz#1039](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1039)
 * Correct off-by-one in percent_expand(): we would fatal() when trying
   to expand EXPAND_MAX_KEYS, allowing only EXPAND_MAX_KEYS-1 to
   actually work. Note that nothing in OpenSSH actually uses close to
   this limit at present. [bz#1607](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607)
 * Fix passing of empty options from [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) and [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) to the
   underlying [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1). Also add support for the stop option "--".
 * Fix an incorrect magic number and typo in PROTOCOL; [bz#1688](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1688)
 * Don't escape backslashes when displaying the SSH2 banner. [bz#1533](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1533)
 * Don't unnecessarily dup() the in and out fds for sftp-server. [bz#1566](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1566)
 * Force use of the correct hash function for random-art signature
   display as it was inheriting the wrong one when bubblebabble
   signatures were activated. [bz#1611](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1611)
 * Do not fall back to adding keys without constraints (ssh-add -c /
   -t ...) when the agent refuses the constrained add request. [bz#1612](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612)
 * Fix a race condition in ssh-agent that could result in a wedged or
   spinning agent. [bz#1633](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1633)
 * Flush stdio before exec() to ensure that everying (motd
   in particular) has made it out before the streams go away. [bz#1596](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1596)
 * Set FD_CLOEXEC on in/out sockets in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). [bz#1706](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1706)

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * Use system's kerberos principal name on AIX if it's available.
   [bz#1583](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1583)
 * Disable OOM-killing of the listening sshd on Linux. [bz#1470](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1470)
 * Use pkg-config for opensc config if it's available. [bz#1160](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1160)
 * Unbreak Redhat spec to allow building without askpass. [bz#1677](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1677)
 * If PidFile is set in sshd_config, use it in SMF init file. [bz#1628](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1628)
 * Print error and usage() when ssh-rand-helper is passed command-
   line arguments as none are supported. [bz#1568](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568)
 * Add missing setsockopt() to set IPV6_V6ONLY for local forwarding
   with GatwayPorts=yes. [bz#1648](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1648)
 * Make GNOME 2 askpass dialog desktop-modal. [bz#1645](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1645)
 * If SELinux is enabled set the security context to "sftpd_t" before
   running the internal sftp server. [bz#1637](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637)
 * Correctly check libselinux for necessary SELinux functions; [bz#1713](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1713)
 * Unbreak builds on Redhat using the supplied openssh.spec; [bz#1731](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1731)
 * Fix incorrect privilege dropping order on AIX that prevented
   chroot operation; [bz#1567](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567)
 * Call aix_setauthdb/aix_restoredb at the correct times on AIX to
   prevent authentication failure; [bz#1710](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1710)

### [OpenSSH 5.3](txt/release-5.3)/[5.3p1](txt/release-5.3) (2009-10-01)

```

OpenSSH 5.3 was released on 2009-10-01. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release marks the 10th anniversary of the OpenSSH project.
We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their support,
especially those who will continue to contribute code or patches,
report bugs, test snapshots or donate to the project during the
next 10 years.  More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

This is a bugfix release, no new features have been added.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.2
=========================

General Bugfixes:

 * Do not limit home directory paths to 256 characters. [bz#1615](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1615)

 * Several minor documentation and correctness fixes.

Portable OpenSSH Bugfixes:

 * This release removes for support for very old versions of Cygwin and
   for Windows 95/98/ME

 * Move the deletion of PAM credentials on logout to after the session
   close. [bz#1534](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1534)

 * Make PrintLastLog work on AIX. [bz#1595](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1595)

 * Avoid compile errors on FreeBSD from conflicts in glob.h. [bz#1634](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1634)

 * Delay dropping of root privileges on AIX so chroot and pam_open_session
   work correctly. [bz#1249](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1249) and [bz#1567](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567)

 * Increase client IO buffer on Cygwin to 64K, realising a significant
   performance improvement.

 * Roll back [bz#1241](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1241) (better handling for expired passwords on Tru64).
   The change broke password logins on some configurations.

 * Accept ENOSYS as a fallback error when attempting atomic
   rename(). [bz#1535](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1535)

 * Fix passing of variables to recursive make(1) invocations on Solaris.
   [bz#1505](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1505)

 * Skip the tcgetattr call on the pty master on Solaris, since it never
   succeeds and can hang if large amounts of data is sent to the slave
   (eg a copy-paste). [bz#1528](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528)

 * Fix detection of krb5-config. [bz#1639](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1639)

 * Fix test for server-assigned remote forwarding port for non-root users.

### [OpenSSH 5.2](txt/release-5.2)/[5.2p1](txt/release-5.2) (2009-02-23)

```

OpenSSH 5.2 was released on 2009-02-23. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We have also recently completed another Internet SSH usage scan, the
results of which may be found at <http://www.openssh.com/usage.html>

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

The focus of this release has been on bugfixes as the previous
openssh-5.1 release introduced many new features and made some
invasive changes.

Changes since OpenSSH 5.1
=========================

Security:

 * This release changes the default cipher order to prefer the AES CTR
   modes and the revised "arcfour256" mode to CBC mode ciphers that are
   susceptible to CPNI-957037 "Plaintext Recovery Attack Against SSH".

 * This release also adds countermeasures to mitigate CPNI-957037-style
   attacks against the SSH protocol's use of CBC-mode ciphers. Upon
   detection of an invalid packet length or Message Authentication
   Code, ssh/sshd will continue reading up to the maximum supported
   packet length rather than immediately terminating the connection.
   This eliminates most of the known differences in behaviour that
   leaked information about the plaintext of injected data which formed
   the basis of this attack. We believe that these attacks are rendered
   infeasible by these changes.

New features:

 * Added a -y option to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to force logging to syslog rather than
   stderr, which is useful when running daemonised (ssh -f)

 * The [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) ForceCommand directive now accepts commandline
   arguments for the internal-sftp server.

 * The [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ~C escape commandline now support runtime creation of
   dynamic (-D) port forwards.

 * Support the SOCKS4A protocol in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) dynamic (-D) forwards.
   ([bz#1482](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1482))

 * Support remote port forwarding with a listen port of '0'. This
   informs the server that it should dynamically allocate a listen
   port and report it back to the client. ([bz#1003](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1003))

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now supports setting PermitEmptyPasswords and
   AllowAgentForwarding in Match blocks

Bug and documentation fixes

 * Repair a [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) crash introduced in openssh-5.1 when the client is
   sent a zero-length banner ([bz#1496](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1496))

 * Due to interoperability problems with certain
   broken SSH implementations, the eow@openssh.com and
   no-more-sessions@openssh.com protocol extensions are now only sent
   to peers that identify themselves as OpenSSH.

 * Make [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) send the correct channel number for
   SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS and SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE messages to
   avoid triggering 'Non-public channel' error messages on [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) in
   openssh-5.1.

 * Avoid printing 'Non-public channel' warnings in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), since the
   [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) has sent incorrect channel numbers since ~2004 (this reverts
   a behaviour introduced in openssh-5.1).

 * Avoid double-free in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ~C escape -L handler ([bz#1539](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1539))

 * Correct fail-on-error behaviour in [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) batchmode for remote
   stat operations. ([bz#1541](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1541))

 * Disable nonfunctional [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ~C escape handler in multiplex slave
   connections. ([bz#1543](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543))

 * Avoid hang in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) when attempting to connect to a server that
   has MaxSessions=0 set.

 * Multiple fixes to [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) configuration test (-T) mode

 * Several core and portable OpenSSH bugs fixed: 1380, 1412, 1418,
   1419, 1421, 1490, 1491, 1492, 1514, 1515, 1518, 1520, 1538, 1540

 * Many manual page improvements.

### [OpenSSH 5.1](txt/release-5.1)/[5.1p1](txt/release-5.1) (2008-07-22)

```

OpenSSH 5.1 was released on 2008-07-22. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We have also recently completed another Internet SSH usage scan, the
results of which may be found at <http://www.openssh.com/usage.html>

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Changes since OpenSSH 5.0
=========================

Security:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): Avoid X11 man-in-the-middle attack on HP/UX (and possibly
   other platforms) when X11UseLocalhost=no

   When attempting to bind(2) to a port that has previously been bound
   with SO_REUSEADDR set, most operating systems check that either the
   effective user-id matches the previous bind (common on BSD-derived
   systems) or that the bind addresses do not overlap (Linux and
   Solaris).

   Some operating systems, such as HP/UX, do not perform these checks
   and are vulnerable to an X11 man-in-the-middle attack when the
   [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) option X11UseLocalhost has been set to "no" - an
   attacker may establish a more-specific bind, which will be used in
   preference to sshd's wildcard listener.

   Modern BSD operating systems, Linux, OS X and Solaris implement the
   above checks and are not vulnerable to this attack, nor are systems
   where the X11UseLocalhost has been left at the default value of
   "yes".

   Portable OpenSSH 5.1 avoids this problem for all operating systems
   by not setting SO_REUSEADDR when X11UseLocalhost is set to no.

   This vulnerability was reported by sway2004009 AT hotmail.com.

New features:

 * Introduce experimental SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualisation to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
   and [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1). Visual fingerprinnt display is controlled by a new
   [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) option "VisualHostKey". The intent is to render
   SSH host keys in a visual form that is amenable to easy recall and
   rejection of changed host keys. This technique inspired by the
   graphical hash visualisation schemes known as "random art[*]", and
   by Dan Kaminsky's musings at 23C3 in Berlin.

   Fingerprint visualisation in is currently disabled by default, as the
   algorithm used to generate the random art is still subject to change.

   [*] "Hash Visualization: a New Technique to improve Real-World
       Security", Perrig A. and Song D., 1999, International Workshop on
       Cryptographic Techniques and E-Commerce (CrypTEC '99)
   <http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf>

 * [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) now supports CIDR address/masklen matching in "Match
   address" blocks, with a fallback to classic wildcard matching. For
   example:
     Match address 192.0.2.0/24,3ffe:ffff::/32,!10.*
         PasswordAuthentication yes

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now supports CIDR matching in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   from="..." restrictions, also with a fallback to classic wildcard
   matching.

 * Added an extended test mode (-T) to [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) to request that it write
   its effective configuration to stdout and exit. Extended test mode
   also supports the specification of connection parameters (username,
   source address and hostname) to test the application of
   [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) Match rules.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now prints the number of bytes transferred and the overall
   connection throughput for SSH protocol 2 sessions when in verbose
   mode (previously these statistics were displayed for protocol 1
   connections only).

 * [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) now supports extension methods statvfs@openssh.com and
   fstatvfs@openssh.com that implement statvfs(2)-like operations.
   ([bz#1399](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1399))

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) now has a "df" command to the sftp client that uses the
   statvfs@openssh.com to produce a df(1)-like display of filesystem
   space and inode utilisation (requires statvfs@openssh.com support on
   the server)

 * Added a MaxSessions option to [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) to allow control of the
   number of multiplexed sessions supported over a single TCP connection.
   This allows increasing the number of allowed sessions above the
   previous default of 10, disabling connection multiplexing
   (MaxSessions=1) or disallowing login/shell/subsystem sessions
   entirely (MaxSessions=0).

 * Added a no-more-sessions@openssh.com global request extension that is
   sent from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) when the client knows that it will never
   request another session (i.e. when session multiplexing is disabled).
   This allows a server to disallow further session requests and
   terminate the session in cases where the client has been hijacked.

 * [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) now supports the use of the -l option in combination
   with -F to search for a host in ~/.ssh/known_hosts and display its
   fingerprint.

 * [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1) now defaults to "rsa" (protocol 2) keys, instead of
   "rsa1".

 * Added an AllowAgentForwarding option to [sshd_config(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.8) to control
   whether authentication agent forwarding is permitted. Note that this
   is a loose control, as a client may install their own unofficial
   forwarder.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): avoid unnecessary malloc/copy/free when receiving
   network data, resulting in a ~10% speedup

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will now try additional addresses when connecting
   to a port forward destination whose DNS name resolves to more than
   one address. The previous behaviour was to try the only first address
   and give up if that failed. ([bz#383](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=383))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now support signalling that channels are
   half-closed for writing, through a channel protocol extension
   notification "eow@openssh.com". This allows propagation of closed
   file descriptors, so that commands such as:
       "ssh -2 localhost od /bin/ls | true"
   do not send unnecessary data over the wire. ([bz#85](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85))

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8): increased the default size of ssh protocol 1 ephemeral keys
   from 768 to 1024 bits.

 * When [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) has been requested to fork after authentication
   ("ssh -f") with ExitOnForwardFailure enabled, delay the fork until
   after replies for any -R forwards have been seen. Allows for robust
   detection of -R forward failure when using -f. ([bz#92](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92))

 * "Match group" blocks in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) now support negation of
   groups. E.g. "Match group staff,!guests" ([bz#1315](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1315))

 * [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) and [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) now allow chmod-like operations to set
   set[ug]id/sticky bits. ([bz#1310](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310))

 * The MaxAuthTries option is now permitted in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) match
   blocks.

 * Multiplexed [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) sessions now support a subset of the ~ escapes
   that are available to a primary connection. ([bz#1331](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1331))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) connection multiplexing will now fall back to creating a new
   connection in most error cases. ([bz#1439](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1439) [bz#1329](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1329))

 * Added some basic interoperability tests against Twisted Conch.

 * Documented OpenSSH's extensions to and deviations from the published
   SSH protocols (the PROTOCOL file in the distribution)

 * Documented OpenSSH's ssh-agent protocol (PROTOCOL.agent).

Bug and documentation fixes

 * Make [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) deal more gracefully with channel requests that fail.
   Previously it would optimistically assume that requests would always
   succeed, which could cause hangs if they did not (e.g. when the
   server runs out of file descriptors). ([bz#1384](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1384))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now reports multiplexing errors via the multiplex slave's
   stderr where possible (subject to LogLevel in the mux master).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now send terminate protocol banners with CR+LF for
   protocol 2 to comply with [RFC 4253](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253). Previously they were terminated
   with CR alone. Protocol 1 banners remain CR terminated. ([bz#1443](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1443))

 * Merged duplicate authentication file checks in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) and refuse to
   read authorised_keys and .shosts from non-regular files. ([bz#1438](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438))

 * Ensure that [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)'s umask disallows at least group and world write,
   even if a more permissive one has been inherited. ([bz#1433](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433))

 * Suppress the warning message from [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) when changing to a
   non-existent user home directory after chrooting. ([bz#1461](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1461))

 * Mention that [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) follows symlinks when performing recursive
   copies. ([bz#1466](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1466))

 * Prevent [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) from erroneously applying public key restrictions
   leaned from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys to other authentication methods
   when public key authentication subsequently fails. ([bz#1472](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1472))

 * Fix protocol keepalive timeouts - in some cases, keepalive packets
   were being sent, but the connection was not being closed when the
   limit for missing replies was exceeded. ([bz#1465](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1465))

 * Fix [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) sending invalid TTY modes when a TTY was forced (ssh -tt)
   but stdin was not a TTY. ([bz#1199](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1199))

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) will now exit with a non-zero exit status if
   ExitOnForwardFailure was set and forwardings were disabled due to a
   failed host key check.

 * Fix MaxAuthTries tests to disallow a free authentication try to
   clients that skipped the protocol 2 "none" authentication method.
   (part of [bz#1432](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432))

 * Make keepalive timeouts apply while synchronously waiting
   for a packet, particularly during key renegotiation. ([bz#1363](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363))

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) has been audited to eliminate fd leaks and calls to fatal()
   in conditions of file descriptor exhaustion.

Portable OpenSSH-specific bugfixes

 * Avoid a [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) hang-on-exit on Solaris caused by depending on the
   success of isatty() on a PTY master (undefined behaviour). Probably
   affected other platforms too. ([bz#1463](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1463))

 * Fixed test for locked accounts on HP/UX with shadowed
   passwords disabled. ([bz#1083](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1083))

 * Disable poll() fallback in atomiciov for Tru64. readv
   doesn't seem to be a comparable object there, which lead to
   compilation errors. ([bz#1386](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1386))

 * Fall back to racy rename if link returns EXDEV. ([bz#1447](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447))

 * Explicitly handle EWOULDBLOCK wherever we handle EAGAIN, on
   some platforms (HP nonstop) it is a distinct errno. ([bz#1467](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467))

 * Avoid NULL dereferences in ancient sigaction replacement
   code. ([bz#1240](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1240))

 * Avoid linking against libgssapi, which despite its name
   doesn't seem to implement all of GSSAPI. ([bz#1276](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1276))

 * Use explicit noreturn attribute instead of __dead, fixing
   compilation problems on Interix. ([bz#1112](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1112))

 * Added support password expiry on Tru64 SIA systems. ([bz#1241](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1241))

 * Fixed an UMAC alignment problem that manifested on Itanium
   platforms. ([bz#1462](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462))

 * The [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) manual now describes the requirements for
   transfer logging in chroot environments. ([bz#1488](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488))

 * Strip trailing dot from hostnames when the [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)
   HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly option is set. ([bz#1200](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1200))

### [OpenSSH 5.0](txt/release-5.0)/[5.0p1](txt/release-5.0) (2008-04-03)

```

OpenSSH 5.0 was released on 2008-04-03. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
We apologise for any inconvenience resulting from this release
being made so shortly after 4.9. Unfortunately we only learned of
the below security issue from the public CVE report. The Debian
OpenSSH maintainers responsible for handling the initial report of
this bug failed to report it via either the private OpenSSH security
contact list (openssh@openssh.com) or the portable OpenSSH Bugzilla
([http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/)](http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/%29).
We ask anyone wishing to report security bugs in OpenSSH to please use
the openssh@openssh.com contact and to practice responsible disclosure.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures

and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.9:
============================

Security:

 * CVE-2008-1483: Avoid possible hijacking of X11-forwarded connections
   by refusing to listen on a port unless all address families bind
   successfully.

### [OpenSSH 4.9](txt/release-4.9)/[4.9p1](txt/release-4.9) (2008-03-31)

```

OpenSSH 4.9 was released on 2008-03-31. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed

and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Note that OpenSSH 4.8 was an OpenBSD-only release shipped with the
OpenBSD 4.3 CD.

Changes since OpenSSH 4.7:
============================

Security:

 * Disable execution of ~/.ssh/rc for sessions where a command has been
   forced by the sshd_config ForceCommand directive. Users who had
   write access to this file could use it to execute abritrary commands.
   This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe default and an extra
   hassle for administrators.

New features:

  * Added chroot(2) support for [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), controlled by a new option
    "ChrootDirectory". Please refer to [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) for details, and
    please use this feature carefully. ([bz#177](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177) [bz#1352](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1352))
  * Linked [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) into [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). The internal sftp server is
    used when the command "internal-sftp" is specified in a Subsystem
    or ForceCommand declaration. When used with ChrootDirectory, the
    internal sftp server requires no special configuration of files
    inside the chroot environment. Please refer to [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) for
    more information.
  * Added a "no-user-rc" option for authorized_keys to disable execution
    of ~/.ssh/rc
  * Added a protocol extension method "posix-rename@openssh.com" for
    [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) to perform POSIX atomic rename() operations.
    ([bz#1400](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1400))
  * Removed the fixed limit of 100 file handles in [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8). The
    server will now dynamically allocate handles up to the number of
    available file descriptors. ([bz#1397](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397))
  * [ssh(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.8) will now skip generation of SSH protocol 1 ephemeral server
    keys when in inetd mode and protocol 2 connections are negotiated.
    This speeds up protocol 2 connections to inetd-mode servers that
    also allow Protocol 1 ([bz#440](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440))
  * Accept the PermitRootLogin directive in a [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) Match
    block. Allows for, e.g. permitting root only from the local
    network.
  * Reworked [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) argument splitting and escaping to be more
    internally consistent (i.e. between sftp commands) and more
    consistent with sh(1). Please note that this will change the
    interpretation of some quoted strings, especially those with
    embedded backslash escape sequences. ([bz#778](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778))
  * Support "Banner=none" in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) to disable sending of a
    pre-login banner (e.g. in a Match block).
  * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ProxyCommands are now executed with $SHELL rather than
    /bin/sh.
  * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)'s ConnectTimeout option is now applied to both the TCP
    connection and the SSH banner exchange (previously it just covered
    the TCP connection). This allows callers of [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to better detect
    and deal with stuck servers that accept a TCP connection but don't
    progress the protocol, and also makes ConnectTimeout useful for
    connections via a ProxyCommand.
  * Many new regression tests, including interop tests against PuTTY's
    plink.
  * Support BSM auditing on Mac OS X

The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

   - [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) incorrectly reported "stalled" on slow copies. ([bz#799](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=799))
   - [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) date underflow for timestamps before epoch. ([bz#828](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=828))
   - [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) and [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) progressmeter type fixes. ([bz#842](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=842))
   - SSH2_MSG_UNIMPLEMENTED packets did not correctly reset the client
     keepalive logic, causing disconnections on servers that did not
     explicitly implement "keepalive@openssh.com". ([bz#1307](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1307))
   - [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) used the obsolete SIG DNS RRtype for host keys in DNS,
     instead of the current standard RRSIG. ([bz#1317](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1317))
   - Extract magic buffer size constants in [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) to #defines.
     ([bz#1333](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1333))
   - Correctly drain ACKs when a [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) upload write fails midway,
     avoids a fatal() exit from what should be a recoverable condition.
     ([bz#1354](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1354))
   - Avoid pointer arithmetic and strict aliasing warnings. ([bz#1355](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1355))
   - Fixed packet size advertisements. Previously TCP and agent
     forwarding incorrectly advertised the channel window size as the
     packet size, causing fatal errors under some conditions. ([bz#1360](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360))
   - Document KbdInteractiveAuthentication in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5). ([bz#1367](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1367))
   - Fixed [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) file handle leak on download when the local file
     could not be opened. ([bz#1375](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1375))
   - Fixed [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) selective host key hashing (i.e.
     "ssh-keygen -HF hostname") to not include any IP address in the
     data to be hashed. ([bz#1376](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376))
   - Fix clobbering of struct passwd from multiple getpwid calls,
     resulting in fatal errors inside tilde_expand_filename. ([bz#1377](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377))
   - Fix parsing of port-forwarding specifications to correctly
     detect errors in either specified port number. ([bz#1378](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378))
   - Fix memory leak in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ~ escape commandline handling. ([bz#1379](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379))
   - Make [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) skip listening on the IPv6 wildcard address when a
     binding address of 0.0.0.0 is used against an old SSH server that
     does not support the [RFC4254](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254) syntax for wildcard bind addresses.
     ([bz#1381](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1381))
   - Remove extra backslashes in the RB_PROTOTYPE macro definition.
     ([bz#1385](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1385))
   - Support [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) RekeyLimits up to the maximum allowed by the
     protocol: 2**32-1. ([bz#1390](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1390))
   - Enable IPV6_V6ONLY socket option on [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) listen socket, as is
     already done for X11/TCP forwarding sockets. ([bz#1392](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392))
   - Fix FD leak that could hang a [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) connection multiplexing
     master. ([bz#1398](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1398))
   - Improve error messages when hostname resolution fails due to a
     system error. ([bz#1417](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1417))
   - Make [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) -q option documentation consistent with reality.
     ([bz#1427](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1427) [bz#1429](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1429))

Portable OpenSSH bugs fixed:

   - Fixed [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) PAM support not calling pam_session_close(), or
     failing to call it with root privileges. ([bz#926](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=926))
   - Made [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) use configuration-specified SyslogFacility for
     hosts_access(3) messages for denied connections. ([bz#1042](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1042))
   - Implement getgrouplist(3) for AIX, enabling NSS LDAP to work on
     this platform. ([bz#1081](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1081))
   - Fix compilation errors on AIX due to misdefinition of LLONG_MAX.
     ([bz#1347](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1347))
   - Force use of local glob(3) implementation on Mac OS X and FreeBSD,
     as the platform versions lack features or have unexpected
     behaviour. ([bz#1407](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1407))
   - Reduce stdout/stderr noise from ssh-copy-id. ([bz#1431](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1431))
   - Fix activation of OpenSSL engine support when requested in
     configure. ([bz#1437](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437))

### [OpenSSH 4.8](txt/release-4.8)/[4.8p1](txt/release-4.8) (2008-03-31)

```

OpenSSH 4.8 was an OpenBSD-only release, included on the OpenBSD 4.3
CD only.

Changes since OpenSSH 4.8:
============================

New features:

  * Added chroot(2) support for [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), controlled by a new option
    "ChrootDirectory". Please refer to [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) for details, and

   - Fixed [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) selective host key hashing (i.e.
     "ssh-keygen -HF hostname") to not include any IP address in the
     data to be hashed. ([bz#1376](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1376))
   - Fix clobbering of struct passwd from multiple getpwid calls,
     resulting in fatal errors inside tilde_expand_filename. ([bz#1377](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1377))
   - Fix parsing of port-forwarding specifications to correctly
     detect errors in either specified port number. ([bz#1378](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1378))
   - Fix memory leak in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ~ escape commandline handling. ([bz#1379](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379))
   - Make [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) skip listening on the IPv6 wildcard address when a
     binding address of 0.0.0.0 is used against an old SSH server that
     does not support the [RFC4254](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254) syntax for wildcard bind addresses.
     ([bz#1381](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1381))

   - Enable IPV6_V6ONLY socket option on [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) listen socket, as is
     already done for X11/TCP forwarding sockets. ([bz#1392](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392))
   - Fix FD leak that could hang a [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) connection multiplexing

### [OpenSSH 4.7](txt/release-4.7)/[4.7p1](txt/release-4.7) (2007-09-05)

```

OpenSSH 4.7 was released on 2007-09-05. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html> and
        <http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html>

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.6:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Prevent [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) from using a trusted X11 cookie if creation of an
   untrusted cookie fails; found and fixed by Jan Pechanec.

Other changes, new functionality and fixes in this release:

 * [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) in new installations defaults to SSH Protocol 2 only.
   Existing installations are unchanged.

 * The SSH channel window size has been increased, and both [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
   [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now send window updates more aggressively. These improves
   performance on high-BDP (Bandwidth Delay Product) networks.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now preserve MAC contexts between packets, which
   saves 2 hash calls per packet and results in 12-16% speedup for
   arcfour256/hmac-md5.

 * A new MAC algorithm has been added, UMAC-64 ([RFC4418](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4418)) as
   "umac-64@openssh.com". UMAC-64 has been measured to be
   approximately 20% faster than HMAC-MD5.

 * A -K flag was added to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to set GSSAPIAuthentication=Yes

 * Failure to establish a [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) TunnelForward is now treated as a
   fatal error when the ExitOnForwardFailure option is set.

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) returns a sensible exit status if the control master goes
   away without passing the full exit status. ([bz #1261](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1261))

 * The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

   - When using a ProxyCommand in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), set the outgoing hostname with
     gethostname(2), allowing hostbased authentication to work ([bz #616](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616))
   - Make [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) skip FIFOs rather than hanging ([bz #856](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=856))
   - Encode non-printing characters in [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) filenames.
     these could cause copies to be aborted with a "protocol error"
     ([bz #891](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=891))
   - Handle SIGINT in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) privilege separation child process to
     ensure that wtmp and lastlog records are correctly updated
     ([bz #1196](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1196))
   - Report GSSAPI mechanism in errors, for libraries that support
     multiple mechanisms ([bz #1220](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1220))
   - Improve documentation for [ssh-add(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1)'s -d option ([bz #1224](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1224))
   - Rearrange and tidy GSSAPI code, removing server-only code being
     linked into the client. ([bz #1225](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1225))
   - Delay execution of [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)'s LocalCommand until after all forwadings
     have been established. ([bz #1232](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1232))
   - In [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), do not truncate non-regular files ([bz #1236](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1236))
   - Improve exit message from ControlMaster clients. ([bz #1262](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1262))
   - Prevent [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8) from reading until it runs out of buffer
     space, whereupon it would exit with a fatal error. ([bz #1286](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1286))

 * Portable OpenSSH bugs fixed:

   - Fix multiple inclusion of paths.h on AIX 5.1 systems. ([bz #1243](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1243))
   - Implement getpeereid for Solaris using getpeerucred. Solaris
     systems will now refuse [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) and [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) ControlMaster
     clients from different, non-root users ([bz #1287](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1287))
   - Fix compilation warnings by including string.h if found. ([bz #1294](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1294))
   - Remove redefinition of _res in getrrsetbyname.c for platforms that
     already define it. ([bz #1299](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1299))
   - Fix spurious "chan_read_failed for istate 3" errors from [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8),
     a side-effect of the "hang on exit" fix introduced in 4.6p1.
     ([bz #1306](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1306))
   - pam_end() was not being called if authentication failed ([bz #1322](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1322))
   - Fix SELinux support when SELinux is in permissive mode. Previously
     [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) was treating SELinux errors as always fatal. ([bz #1325](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1325))
   - Ensure that pam_setcred(..., PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED) is called before
     pam_setcred(..., PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED), fixing pam_dhkeys.
     ([bz #1339](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1339))
   - Fix privilege separation on QNX - pre-auth only, this platform does
     not support file descriptior passing needed for post-auth privilege
     separation. ([bz #1343](https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1343))

 * sshd now allows the enabling and disabling of authentication
   methods on a per user, group, host and network basis via the
   Match directive in sshd_config.

 * The following bugs have been fixed in this release:

   - Clear SIGALRM when restarting due to SIGHUP. Prevents stray
     signal from taking down sshd if a connection was pending at
     the time SIGHUP was received
   - sftp returned a zero exit status when upload failed due to write
     errors (bugzilla #1252)
   - fixed an inconsistent check for a terminal when displaying scp
     progress meter (bugzilla #1265)
   - Parsing of time values in Match blocks was incorrectly applied
     to the global configuration (bugzilla #1275)
   - Allow multiple forwarding options to work when specified in a
     PermitOpen directive (bugzilla #1267)
   - Interoperate with ssh.com versions that do not support binding
     remote port forwarding sessions to a hostname (bugzilla #1019)

 * Portable OpenSSH bugs fixed:

   - "hang on exit" when background processes are running at the time
     of exit on a ttyful/login session (bugzilla #52)
   - Fix typos in the ssh-rand-helper(8) man page (bugzilla #1259)
   - Check that some SIG records have been returned in getrrsetbyname
     (bugzilla #1281)
   - Fix contrib/findssl for platforms that lack "which" (bugzilla
     #1237)
   - Work around bug in OpenSSL 0.9.8e that broke aes256-ctr,
     aes192-ctr, arcfour256 (bugzilla #1291)

### [OpenSSH 4.4](txt/release-4.4)/[4.4p1](txt/release-4.4) (2006-09-27)

```

OpenSSH 4.4 was released on 2006-09-27. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0

and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.3:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * Fix a pre-authentication denial of service found by Tavis Ormandy,
   that would cause [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) to spin until the login grace time
   expired.

 * Fix an unsafe signal hander reported by Mark Dowd. The signal
   handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be exploited
   to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. On portable
   OpenSSH, this vulnerability could theoretically lead to
   pre-authentication remote code execution if GSSAPI authentication
   is enabled, but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears
   remote.

 * On portable OpenSSH, fix a GSSAPI authentication abort that could
   be used to determine the validity of usernames on some platforms.

This release includes the following new functionality and fixes:

 * Implemented conditional configuration in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) using the
   "Match" directive. This allows some configuration options to be
   selectively overridden if specific criteria (based on user, group,
   hostname and/or address) are met. So far a useful subset of post-
   authentication options are supported and more are expected to be
   added in future releases.

 * Add support for Diffie-Hellman group exchange key agreement with a
   final hash of SHA256.

 * Added a "ForceCommand" directive to [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5). Similar to the
   command="..." option accepted in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, this forces
   the execution of the specified command regardless of what the user
   requested. This is very useful in conjunction with the new "Match"
   option.

 * Add a "PermitOpen" directive to [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5). This mirrors the
   permitopen="..." authorized_keys option, allowing fine-grained
   control over the port-forwardings that a user is allowed to
   establish.

 * Add optional logging of transactions to [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8).

 * [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) will now record port numbers for hosts stored in
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys when a non-standard port has been requested.

 * Add an "ExitOnForwardFailure" option to cause [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) to exit (with
   a non-zero exit code) when requested port forwardings could not be
   established.

 * Extend [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) "SubSystem" declarations to allow the
   specification of command-line arguments.

 * Replacement of all integer overflow susceptible invocations of
   malloc(3) and realloc(3) with overflow-checking equivalents.

 * Many manpage fixes and improvements

 * New portable OpenSSH-specific features:

   - Add optional support for SELinux, controlled using the
     --with-selinux configure option (experimental)

   - Add optional support for Solaris process contracts, enabled
     using the --with-solaris-contracts configure option (experimental)
     This option will also include SMF metadata in Solaris packages
     built using the "make package" target

   - Add optional support for OpenSSL hardware accelerators (engines),
     enabled using the --with-ssl-engine configure option.

 * Bugs from <http://bugzilla.mindrot.org> fixed:
    #482  - readconf doesn't accept paths with spaces in them.
    #906  - syslog messages from sshd [net] lost.
    #975  - Kerberos authentication timing can leak information
            about account validity.
    #981  - Flow stop in SSH2.
    #1102 - C program 'write' with zero length hangs.
    #1129 - sshd hangs for command-only invocations due to
            fork/child signals.
    #1131 - error "buffer_append_space:alloc not supported"
    #1138 - Passphrase asked for (but ignored) if key file permissions
            too liberal..
    #1156 - Closes connection after C-c is pressed on QNX.
    #1157 - ssh-keygen doesn't handle DOS line breaks.
    #1159 - %u and %h not handled in IdentityFile.
    #1161 - scp -r fails.
    #1162 - Inappropriate sequence of syslog messages.
    #1166 - openssh-4.3p1 has some issues compiling.
    #1171 - configure can't always figure out LLONG_MAX..
    #1173 - scp reports lost connection for very large files.
    #1177 - Incorrect sshrc file location in Makefile.in.
    #1179 - sshd incorrectly rejects  connections due to IP options.
    #1181 - configure should detect when openssl-0.9.8x needs -ldl.
    #1186 - ssh tries multiple times to open unprotected keys.
    #1188 - keyboard-interactive should not allow retry after
            pam_acct_mgmt fails.
    #1193 - Open ssh will not allow changing of passwords on usernames
            greater than 8 characters..
    #1201 - Bind address information is not specified in command line
            help messages.
    #1203 - configure.ac is missing an open [.
    #1207 - sshd does not clear unsuccessful login count on
            non-interactive logins.
    #1218 - GSSAPI client code permits SPNEGO usage.
    #1221 - Banner only suppressed at log level = QUIET (used to be
            at log level < INFO).

 * Fixes to memory and file descriptor leaks reported by the Coverity
   static analysis tool

 * Fixes to inconsistent pointer checks reported by the Stanford
   SATURN tool

### [OpenSSH 4.3p2](txt/release-4.3p2) (2006-02-11)

```

Portable OpenSSH 4.3p2 was released on 2006-02-11. It will be available
from the mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We have also recently completed another Internet SSH usage scan, the
results of which may be found at <http://www.openssh.com/usage.html>

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots and purchased
T-shirts or posters.

T-shirt, poster and CD sales directly support the project. Pictures
and more information can be found at:
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html> and
	<http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html>

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since Portable OpenSSH 4.3p1:
====================================

This is a release of Portable OpenSSH only, to resolve some
portability bugs. There are no new features, only fixes:

 * Explicitly test for egrep in ./configure, fixing a problem in 4.3p1
   that caused some platforms to fail to detect the available fields
   in utmp/wtmp/lastlog records. This bug manifested as missing or
   empty login/logout records (as seen by last(1), etc.)

 * Fix for logout records not being updated on platforms without
   support for post-authentication privilege separation (e.g. Cygwin)

 * Fixed compilation problems on Ultrix, NewsOS and QNX

Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, reported bugs or test
releases.

and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.2:
============================

Security bugs resolved in this release:

 * CVE-2006-0225: scp (as does rcp, on which it is based) invoked a
   subshell to perform local to local, and remote to remote copy
   operations. This subshell exposed filenames to shell expansion
   twice; allowing a local attacker to create filenames containing
   shell metacharacters that, if matched by a wildcard, could lead
   to execution of attacker-specified commands with the privilege of
   the user running scp (Bugzilla #1094)

This is primarily a bug-fix release, only one new feature has been
added:

 * Add support for tunneling arbitrary network packets over a
   connection between an OpenSSH client and server via tun(4) virtual
   network interfaces. This allows the use of OpenSSH (4.3+) to create
   a true VPN between the client and server providing real network
   connectivity at layer 2 or 3. This feature is experimental and is
   currently supported on OpenBSD, Linux, NetBSD (IPv4 only) and
   FreeBSD. Other operating systems with tun/tap interface capability
   may be added in future portable OpenSSH releases. Please refer to
   the README.tun file in the source distribution for further details
   and usage examples.

Some of the other bugs resolved and internal improvements are:

 * Reduce default key length for new DSA keys generated by ssh-keygen
   back to 1024 bits. DSA is not specified for longer lengths and does
   not fully benefit from simply making keys longer. As per FIPS 186-2
   Change Notice 1, ssh-keygen will refuse to generate a new DSA key
   smaller or larger than 1024 bits

 * Fixed X forwarding failing to start when a the X11 client is executed
   in background at the time of session exit (Bugzilla #1086)

 * Change ssh-keygen to generate a protocol 2 RSA key when invoked
   without arguments (Bugzilla #1064)

 * Fix timing variance for valid vs. invalid accounts when attempting
   Kerberos authentication (Bugzilla #975)

 * Ensure that ssh always returns code 255 on internal error (Bugzilla
   #1137)

 * Cleanup wtmp files on SIGTERM when not using privsep (Bugzilla #1029)

 * Set SO_REUSEADDR on X11 listeners to avoid problems caused by
   lingering sockets from previous session (X11 applications can
   sometimes not connect to 127.0.0.1:60xx) (Bugzilla #1076)

 * Ensure that fds 0, 1 and 2 are always attached in all programs, by
   duping /dev/null to them if necessary.

 * Xauth list invocation had bogus "." argument (Bugzilla #1082)

 * Remove internal assumptions on key exchange hash algorithm and output
   length, preparing OpenSSH for KEX methods with alternate hashes.

 * Ignore junk sent by a server before  it sends the "SSH-" banner
   (Bugzilla #1067)

 * The manpages has been significantly improves and rearranged, in
   addition to other specific manpage fixes:
   #1037 - Man page entries for -L and -R should mention -g.
   #1077 - Descriptions for "ssh -D" and DynamicForward should mention
           they can specify "bind_address" optionally.
   #1088 - Incorrect descriptions in ssh_config man page for
           ControlMaster=no.
   #1121 - Several corrections for ssh_agent manpages

 * Lots of cleanups, including fixes to memory leaks on error paths
   (Bugzilla #1109, #1110, #1111 and more) and possible crashes (#1092)

 * Portable OpenSSH-specific fixes:

   - Pass random seed during re-exec for each connection: speeds up
     processing of new connections on platforms using the OpenSSH's
     builtin entropy collector (ssh-rand-helper)

   - PAM fixes and improvements:
     #1045 - Missing option for ignoring the /etc/nologin file
     #1087 - Show PAM password expiry message from LDAP on login
     #1028 - Forward final non-query conversations to client
     #1126 - Prevent user from being forced to change an expired
             password repeatedly on AIX in some PAM configurations.
     #1045 - Do not check /etc/nologin when PAM is enabled, instead
             allow PAM to handle it.  Note that on platforms using
             PAM, the pam_nologin module should be used in sshd's
             session stack in order to maintain past behaviour

   - Portability-related fixes:
     #989  - Fix multiplexing regress test on Solaris
     #1097 - Cross-compile fixes.
     #1096 - ssh-keygen broken on HPUX.
     #1098 - $MAIL being set incorrectly for HPUX server login.
     #1104 - Compile error on Tru64 Unix 4.0f
     #1106 - Updated .spec file and startup for SuSE.
     #1122 - Use _GNU_SOURCE define in favor of __USE_GNU, fixing
             compilation problems on glibc 2.4

### [OpenSSH 4.2](txt/release-4.2)/[4.2p1](txt/release-4.2) (2005-09-01)

```

OpenSSH 4.2 was released on 2005-09-01. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support of the project, especially those who contributed source,

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.1:
============================

  - SECURITY: Fix a bug introduced in OpenSSH 4.0 that caused
    GatewayPorts to be incorrectly activated for dynamic ("-D") port
    forwardings when no listen address was explicitly specified.

  - SECURITY: sshd in OpenSSH versions prior to 4.2 allow GSSAPI
    credentials to be delegated to users who log in with methods
    other than GSSAPI authentication (e.g. public key) when the
    client requests it. This behaviour has been changed in OpenSSH
    4.2 to only delegate credentials to users who authenticate
    using the GSSAPI method. This eliminates the risk of credentials
    being inadvertently exposed to an untrusted user/host (though
    users should not activate GSSAPIDelegateCredentials to begin
    with when the remote user or host is untrusted)

  - Added a new compression method that delays the start of zlib
    compression until the user has been authenticated successfully.
    The new method ("Compression delayed") is on by default in the
    server. This eliminates the risk of any zlib vulnerability
    leading to a compromise of the server from unauthenticated users.

    NB. Older OpenSSH (<3.5) versions have a bug that will cause them
    to refuse to connect to any server that does not offer compression
    when the client has compression requested. Since the new "delayed"
    server mode isn't supported by these older clients, they will
    refuse to connect to a new server unless compression is disabled
    (on the client end) or the original compression method is enabled
    on the server ("Compression yes" in sshd_config)

  - Another round of proactive changes for signed vs unsigned integer
    bugs has been completed, including changing the atomicio() API to
    encourage safer programming. This work is ongoing.

  - Added support for the improved arcfour cipher modes from
    draft-harris-ssh-arcfour-fixes-02. The improves the cipher's
    resistance to a number of attacks by discarding early keystream
    output.

  - Increase the default size of new RSA/DSA keys generated by
    ssh-keygen from 1024 to 2048 bits.

  - Many bugfixes and improvements to connection multiplexing,
    including:

    - Added ControlMaster=auto/autoask options to support opportunistic
      multiplexing (see the [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) manpage for details).

    - The client will now gracefully fallback to starting a new TCP
      connection if it cannot connect to a specified multiplexing
      control socket

    - Added %h (target hostname), %p (target port) and %r (remote
      username) expansion sequences to ControlPath. Also allow
      ControlPath=none to disable connection multiplexing.

    - Implemented support for X11 and agent forwarding over multiplexed
      connections. Because of protocol limitations, the slave
      connections inherit the master's DISPLAY and SSH_AUTH_SOCK rather
      than distinctly forwarding their own.

  - Portable OpenSSH: Added support for long passwords (> 8-char) on
    UnixWare 7.

  - The following bugs from <http://bugzilla.mindrot.org/> were closed:

     #471  - Misleading error message if /dev/tty perms wrong
     #623  - Don't use $HOME in manpages
     #829  - Don't allocate a tty if -n option is set
     #1025 - Correctly handle disabled special character in ttymodes
     #1033 - Fix compile-time warnings
     #1046 - AIX 5.3 Garbage on Login
     #1054 - Don't terminate connection on getpeername() failure
     #1076 - GSSAPIDelegateCredentials issue mentioned above

  - Lots of other improvements and fixes. Please refer to the ChangeLog
    for details

Thanks to everyone who has contributed patches, problem or test reports.

### [OpenSSH 4.1](txt/release-4.1)/[4.1p1](txt/release-4.1) (2005-05-26)

```

OpenSSH 4.1 was released on 2005-05-26. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18>

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 4.0:
============================

* This is a bugfix release, no new features have been added. Some notable
  fixes are:

  - Fix segfault when using forwardings configured in [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) and
    ClearAllForwardings (bugzilla #996)

  - Limit input buffer size for channels. A peer could send more data
    than the buffer code was willing to accept. This would cause OpenSSH
    to abort the connection (bugzilla #896)

* Several improvements to the regression tests

* Portable OpenSSH:

  - OpenSSH will now always normalise IPv4 in IPv6 mapped addresses back to
    IPv4 addresses. This means that IPv4 addresses in log messages on IPv6
    enabled machines will no longer be prefixed by "::ffff:" and AllowUsers,
    DenyUsers, AllowGroups, DenyGroups will match IPv4-style addresses only
    for 4-in-6 mapped connections. This ensures a consistent representation
    of IPv4 addresses regardless of whether or not the machine is IPv6
    enabled.

* Other bugfixes, including bugzilla #950, #997, #998, #999, #1005, #1006,
  #1024, and #1038

Changes since OpenSSH 3.9:
============================

* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now allows the optional specification of an address to bind to
  in port forwarding connections (local, remote and dynamic). Please
  refer to the documentation for the -L and -R options in the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
  manual page and the LocalForward and RemoteForward options in the
  [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) manpage. (Bugzilla #413)

* To control remote bindings while retaining backwards compatibility,
  [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)'s GatewayPorts option has been extended. To allow client
  specified bind addresses for remote (-R) port forwardings, the server
  must be configured with "GatewayPorts clientspecified".

* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [ssh-keyscan(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1) now support hashing of host names and
  addresses added to known_hosts files, controlled by the [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)
  HashKnownHosts configuration directive. This option improves user
  privacy by hiding which hosts have been visited. At present this
  option is off by default, but may be turned on once it receives
  sufficient testing.

* Added options for managing keys in known_hosts files to [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1),
  including the ability to search for hosts by name, delete hosts by
  name and convert an unhashed known_hosts file into one with hashed
  names. These are particularly useful for managing known_hosts files
  with hashed hostnames.

* Improve account and password expiry support in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8). Ther server
  will now warn in advance for both account and password expiry.

* [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) will now log the source of connections denied by AllowUsers,
  DenyUsers, AllowGroups and DenyGroups (Bugzilla #909)

* Added AddressFamily option to [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) to allow global control over
  IPv4/IPv6 usage. (Bugzilla #989)

* Improved [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) client, including bugfixes and optimisations for the
  ``ls'' command and command history and editing support using libedit.

* Improved the handling of bad data in authorized_keys files,
  eliminating fatal errors on corrupt or very large keys. (Bugzilla
  #884)

* Improved connection multiplexing support in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1). Several bugs
  have been fixed and a new "command mode" has been added to allow the
  control of a running multiplexing master connection, including
  checking that it is up, determining its PID and asking it to exit.

* Have [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) and [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) wait for the spawned ssh to exit before they
  exit themselves.  This prevents ssh from being unable to restore
  terminal modes (not normally a problem on OpenBSD but common with
  -Portable on POSIX platforms). (Bugzilla #950)

* Portable OpenSSH:

  - Add *EXPERIMENTAL* BSM audit support for Solaris systems
    (Bugzilla #125)

  - Enable IPv6 on AIX where possible (see README.platform for
    details), working around a misfeature of AIX's getnameinfo.
    (Bugzilla #835)

  - Teach [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) to write failed login records to btmp for
    unsuccessful auth attempts. Currently this is only for password,
    keyboard-interactive and challenge/response authentication methods
    and only on Linux and HP-UX.

  - [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now sends output from failing PAM session modules to the
    user before exiting, similar to the way /etc/nologin is handled

  - Store credentials from gssapi-with-mic authentication early enough
    to be available to PAM session modules when privsep=yes.

### [OpenSSH 3.9](txt/release-3.9)/[3.9p1](txt/release-3.9) (2004-08-18)

```

OpenSSH 3.9 was released on 2004-08-18. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18>

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Changes since OpenSSH 3.8:
============================

* Added new "IdentitiesOnly" option to [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), which specifies that it should
  use keys specified in ssh_config, rather than any keys in [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)

* Make [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) re-execute itself on accepting a new connection. This security
  measure ensures that all execute-time randomisations are reapplied for each
  connection rather than once, for the master process' lifetime. This includes
  mmap and malloc mappings, shared library addressing, shared library mapping
  order, ProPolice and StackGhost cookies on systems that support such things

* Add strict permission and ownership checks to programs reading ~/.ssh/config
  NB [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) will now exit instead of trying to process a config with poor
  ownership or permissions

* Implemented the ability to pass selected environment variables between the
  client and the server. See "AcceptEnv" in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) and "SendEnv" in
  [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) for details

* Added a "MaxAuthTries" option to [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), allowing control over the maximum
  number of authentication attempts permitted per connection

* Added support for cancellation of active remote port forwarding sessions.
  This may be performed using the ~C escape character, see "Escape Characters"
  in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) for details

* Many [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) interface improvements, including greatly enhanced "ls" support
  and the ability to cancel active transfers using SIGINT (^C)

* Implement session multiplexing: a single [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) connection can now carry
  multiple login/command/file transfer sessions. Refer to the "ControlMaster"
  and "ControlPath" options in [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) for more information

* The sftp-server has improved support for non-POSIX filesystems (e.g. FAT)

* Portable OpenSSH: Re-introduce support for PAM password authentication, in
  addition to the keyboard-interactive driver. PAM password authentication
  is less flexible, and doesn't support pre-authentication password expiry but
  runs in-process so Kerberos tokens, etc are retained

* Improved and more extensive regression tests

* Many bugfixes and small improvements

Changes since OpenSSH 3.7.1:
============================

* [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now supports forced changes of expired passwords via
  /usr/bin/passwd or keyboard-interactive authentication.

  Note for AIX: sshd will now deny password access to accounts with
  passwords expired longer than their maxexpired attribute.  For
  details, see the AIX section in README.platform.

* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now uses untrusted cookies for X11-Forwarding.
  Some X11 applications might need full access to the X11 server,
  see ForwardX11Trusted in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and xauth(1) for more information.

* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now supports sending application layer
  keep-alive messages to the server.  See ServerAliveInterval
  in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) for more information.

* Improved [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) batch file support.

### [OpenSSH 3.7.1p2](txt/release-3.7.1p2) (2003-09-23)

```

Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2  was released on 2003-09-23. It will be available
from the mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html> shortly.

Please note that this is a release to address issues in the portable
version only. The items mentioned below do not affect the OpenBSD
version.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18>

For international orders use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <http://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Security Changes:
=================

  Portable OpenSSH version 3.7p1 and 3.7.1p1 contain multiple
  vulnerabilities in the new PAM authentication code. At least one of
  these bugs is remotely exploitable (under a non-standard
  configuration, with privsep disabled).

  OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 fixes these bugs. Please note that these bugs do not
  exist in OpenBSD's releases of OpenSSH.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.7.1p1:
==============================

* This release disables PAM by default. To enable it, set "UsePAM yes" in
  sshd_config. Due to complexity, inconsistencies in the specification and
  differences between vendors' PAM implementations we recommend that PAM
  be left disabled in sshd_config unless there is a need for its use.
  Sites using only public key or simple password authentication usually
  have little need to enable PAM support.

* This release now requires zlib 1.1.4 to build correctly. Previous
  versions have security problems.

* Fix compilation for versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.6. Some cipher modes
  are not supported for older OpenSSL versions.

* Fix compilation problems on systems with a missing or lacking inet_ntoa()
  function.

* Workaround problems related to unimplemented or broken setresuid/setreuid
  functions on several platforms.

* Fix compilation on older OpenBSD systems.

* Fix handling of password-less authentication (PermitEmptyPasswords=yes)
  that has not worked since the 3.7p1 release.

### [OpenSSH 3.7.1](txt/release-3.7.1)/[3.7.1p1](txt/release-3.7.1) (2004-02-25)

```

OpenSSH 3.7.1 was released on 2004-02-25. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        <http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18>

For international orders use <https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order>
and for European orders, use <https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order.eu>

Security Changes:
=================

  All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7.1 contain buffer
  management errors.  It is uncertain whether these errors are
  potentially exploitable, however, we prefer to see bugs
  fixed proactively.

  OpenSSH 3.7 fixed one of these bugs.

  OpenSSH 3.7.1 fixes more similar bugs.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.6.1:
============================

* The entire OpenSSH code-base has undergone a license review. As
  a result, all non-ssh1.x code is under a BSD-style license with no
  advertising requirement. Please refer to README in the source
  distribution for the exact license terms.

* Rhosts authentication has been removed in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8).

* Changes in Kerberos support:

    - KerberosV password support now uses a file cache instead of
      a memory cache.

    - KerberosIV and AFS support has been removed.

    - KerberosV support has been removed from SSH protocol 1.

    - KerberosV password authentication support remains for SSH
      protocols 1 and 2.

    - This release contains some GSSAPI user authentication support
      to replace legacy KerberosV authentication support. At present
      this code is still considered experimental and SHOULD NOT BE
      USED.

* Changed order that keys are tried in public key authentication.
  The [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) client tries the keys in the following order:

     1. [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) keys that are found in the [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) file
     2. remaining [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) keys
     3. keys that are only listed in the [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) file

  This helps when an [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) has many keys, where the [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)
  server might close the connection before the correct key is tried.

* SOCKS5 support has been added to the dynamic forwarding mode
  in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1).

* Removed implementation barriers to operation of SSH over SCTP.

* [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) client can now transfer files with quote characters in
  their filenames.

* Replaced [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)'s VerifyReverseMapping with UseDNS option.
  When UseDNS option is on, reverse hostname lookups are always
  performed.

* Fix a number of memory leaks.

* Support for sending tty BREAK over SSH protocol 2.

* Workaround for other vendor bugs in KEX guess handling.

* Support for generating KEX-GEX groups (/etc/moduli) in [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1).

* Automatic re-keying based on amount of data sent over connection.

* New AddressFamily option on client to select protocol to use (IPv4
  or IPv6).

* Experimental support for the "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", and
  "aes256-ctr" ciphers for SSH protocol 2.

* Experimental support for host keys in DNS (draft-ietf-secsh-dns-xx.txt).
  Please see README.dns in the source distribution for details.

* Portable OpenSSH:

    - Replace PAM password authentication kludge with a more correct
      PAM challenge-response module from FreeBSD.

    - PAM support may now be enabled/disabled at runtime using the
      UsePAM directive.

    - Many improvements to the OpenSC smartcard support.

    - Regression tests now work with portable OpenSSH.
      Please refer to regress/README.regress in the source distribution.

    - On platforms that support it, portable OpenSSH now honors the
      UMASK, PATH and SUPATH attributes set in /etc/default/login.

    - Deny access to locked accounts, regardless of authentication
      method in use.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.6:
==========================

* The 'kex guesses' bugfix from OpenSSH 3.6 triggers a bug
  in a few other SSH v2 implementations and causes connections to
  stall.  OpenSSH 3.6.1 disables this bugfix when interoperating
  with these implementations.

Changes between OpenSSH 3.5 and OpenSSH 3.6:
============================================

### [OpenSSH 3.5](txt/release-3.5)/[3.5p1](txt/release-3.5) (2002-10-15)

```

OpenSSH 3.5 was released on 2002-10-15. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.4:
============================

* Improved support for Privilege Separation (Portability, Kerberos,
  PermitRootLogin handling).

* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) prints out all known host keys for a host if it receives an
  unknown host key of a different type.

* Fixed AES/Rijndael EVP integration for OpenSSL < 0.9.7 (caused
  problems with bounds checking patches for gcc).

* [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8) is disabled by default and only enabled if the
  HostbasedAuthentication option is enabled in the global [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5)
  file.

* [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8) uses RSA blinding in order to avoid timing attacks
  against the RSA host key.

* A use-after-free bug was fixed in [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8).  This bug
  broke hostbased authentication on several platforms.

* [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) is now installed setgid in order to avoid ptrace(2)
  attacks.

* [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1) now restricts the access with getpeereid(2) (or
  equivalent, where available).

* [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) no longer uses the ASN.1 parsing code from libcrypto when
  verifying RSA signatures.

* [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) now sets the SSH_CONNECTION environment variable.

* Enhanced "ls" support for the [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1) client, including globbing and
  detailed listings.

* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now always falls back to uncompressed sessions, if the
  server does not support compression.

* The default behavior of [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) with regard to user settable
  environ variables has changed:  the new option PermitUserEnvironment
  is disabled by default, see [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5).

* The default value for LoginGraceTime has been changed from 600 to 120
  seconds, see [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5).

* Removed erroneous SO_LINGER handling.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.3:
============================

Security Changes:
=================

  All versions of OpenSSH's sshd between 2.9.9 and 3.3
  contain an input validation error that can result in
  an integer overflow and privilege escalation.

  OpenSSH 3.4 fixes this bug.

  In addition, OpenSSH 3.4 adds many checks to detect
  invalid input and mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.

  OpenSSH 3.2 and later prevent privilege escalation
  if UsePrivilegeSeparation is enabled in sshd_config.
  OpenSSH 3.3 enables UsePrivilegeSeparation by
  default.

	privilege separation is now enabled by default

  See UsePrivilegeSeparation in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5)
  and <http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html> for more
  information.
- ssh no longer needs to be installed setuid root for protocol
  version 2 hostbased authentication, see [ssh-keysign(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8).
  protocol version 1 rhosts-rsa authentication still requires privileges
  and is not recommended.

Other Changes:
==============

- documentation for the client and server configuration options have
  been moved to [ssh_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) and [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5).

```

OpenSSH 3.2.3 was released on 2002-05-23. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.2.2:
============================

  This release fixes several problems in OpenSSH 3.2.2:

    - a defect in the BSD_AUTH access control handling for
      OpenBSD and BSD/OS systems:

      Under certain conditions, on systems using YP with netgroups
      in the password database, it is possible that sshd does ACL
      checks for the requested user name but uses the password
      database entry of a different user for authentication. This
      means that denied users might authenticate successfully while
      permitted users could be locked out (OpenBSD PR 2659).

    - login/tty problems on Solaris (bug #245)

    - build problems on Cygwin systems

Changes between OpenSSH 3.1 and OpenSSH 3.2.2:
==============================================

  Security Changes:
  =================

  - fixed buffer overflow in Kerberos/AFS token passing
  - fixed overflow in Kerberos client code
  - sshd no longer auto-enables Kerberos/AFS
  - experimental support for privilege separation,
    see UsePrivilegeSeparation in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) and
  	  <http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html>
    for more information.
  - only accept RSA keys of size SSH_RSA_MINIMUM_MODULUS_SIZE (768) or larger

  Other Changes:
  ==============

  - improved smartcard support (including support for OpenSC,
    see www.opensc.org)
  - improved Kerberos support (including support for MIT-Kerberos V)
  - fixed stderr handling in protocol v2
  - client reports failure if -R style TCP forwarding fails in protocol v2
  - support configuration of TCP forwarding during interactive sessions (~C)
  - improved support for older sftp servers
  - improved support for importing old DSA keys (from ssh.com software).
  - client side suport for PASSWD_CHANGEREQ in protocol v2
  - fixed waitpid race conditions
  - record correct lastlogin time

### [OpenSSH 3.1](txt/release-3.1)/[3.1p1](txt/release-3.1) (2004-04-09)

```

OpenSSH 3.1 was released on 2004-04-09. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.

### [OpenSSH 3.0.2](txt/release-3.0.2)/[3.0.2p1](txt/release-3.0.2) (2002-12-04)

```

OpenSSH 3.0.2 was released on 2002-12-04. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

        This release fixes a vulnerability in the UseLogin option
        of OpenSSH.  This option is not enabled in the default
        installation of OpenSSH.

        However, if UseLogin is enabled by the administrator, all
        versions of OpenSSH prior to 3.0.2 may be vulnerable to
        local attacks.

        The vulnerability allows local users to pass environment
        variables (e.g. LD_PRELOAD) to the login process.  The login
        process is run with the same privilege as sshd (usually
        with root privilege).

        Do not enable UseLogin on your machines or disable UseLogin
        again in /etc/sshd_config:
		UseLogin no

We also have received many reports about attacks against the crc32
bug.  This bug has been fixed about 12 months ago in OpenSSH 2.3.0.
However, these attacks cause non-vulnerable daemons to chew a lot
of cpu since the crc32 attack sends a tremendously large amount of
data which must be processed.

OpenSSH is brought to you by Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt,
Kevin Steves, Damien Miller and Ben Lindstrom.

The following patch fixes the UseLogin vulnerability in OpenSSH 3.0.1 and
earlier releases.

### [OpenSSH 3.0.1](txt/release-3.0.1)/[3.0.1p1](txt/release-3.0.1) (2001-11-19)

```

OpenSSH 3.0.1 was released on 2001-11-19. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

        A security hole that may allow an attacker to authenticate
        if -- and only if -- the administrator has enabled KerberosV.
        By default, OpenSSH KerberosV support only becomes active
        after KerberosV has been properly configured.

        An excessive memory clearing bug (which we believe to be
        unexploitable) also exists, but since this may cause daemon
        crashes, we are providing a fix as well.

        Various other non-critical fixes (~& support and more).

### [OpenSSH 3.0](txt/release-3.0)/[3.0p1](txt/release-3.0) (2001-11-06)

```

OpenSSH 3.0 was released on 2001-11-06. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

1) SSH protocol v2 is now the default protocol version

	use the 'Protocol' option from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) if
	you need to change this.

2) The files
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
   are now obsolete, you can use
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts
	~/.ssh/known_hosts
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   For backward compatibility ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 will still used for
   authentication and hostkeys are still read from the known_hosts2.
   However, those deprecated files are considered 'readonly'.  Future
   releases are likely not to read these files.

3) The CheckMail option in sshd_config is deprecated, as [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) no longer
   checks for new mail.

4) X11 cookies are now stored in $HOME.

New Features:
=============

1) Smartcard support in the ssh client and agent based on work by
   University of Michigan CITI ([http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/smartcard/)](http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/smartcard/%29).
2) support for Rekeying in protocol version 2

3) improved Kerberos support in protocol v1 (KerbIV and KerbV)

4) backward compatibility with older commercial SSH versions >= 2.0.10

5) getopt(3) is now used by all programs

6) dynamic forwarding (use [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) as your socks server)

7) ClearAllForwardings in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)

8) [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now checks the hostkey for localhost (NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes/no).

9) -F option in [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)

10) [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) now has a '-b bindaddress' option

11) [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) allows "scp /file localhost:/file"

12) The AuthorizedKeysFile option allows specification of alternative
    files that contain the public keys that can be used for user authentication
    (e.g. /etc/ssh_keys/%u, see [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8))

13) extended AllowUsers user@host syntax in [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)

### [OpenSSH 2.9.9](txt/release-2.9.9)/[2.9.9p1](txt/release-2.9.9) (2001-09-25)

```

OpenSSH 2.9.9 has just been uploaded. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH 2.9.9 fixes a weakness in the key file option handling,
including source IP based access control.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Security Notes:
===============

This release fixes weakness in the source IP based access control
for SSH protocol v2 public key authentication:

        Versions of OpenSSH between 2.5 and 2.9.9 are
        affected if they use the 'from=' key file option in
        combination with both RSA and DSA keys in
        ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2.

        Depending on the order of the user keys in
        ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 sshd might fail to apply the
        source IP based access control restriction (e.g.
        from="10.0.0.1") to the correct key:

        If a source IP restricted key (e.g. DSA key) is
        immediately followed by a key of a different type
        (e.g. RSA key), then key options for the second key
        are applied to both keys, which includes 'from='.

	This means that users can circumvent the system policy
	and login from disallowed source IP addresses.

Important Changes:
==================

OpenSSH 2.9.9 might have upgrade issues introduced by the long time
between releases, which may affect people in unforseen ways:

1) The files
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/known_hosts2
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys2
   are now obsolete, you can use
	/etc/ssh_known_hosts
	~/.ssh/known_hosts
	~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   For backward compatibility ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 is still used for
   authentication and hostkeys are still read from the known_hosts2.
   However, old files are considered 'readonly'.  Future releases are
   likely to not read these files.

2) The CheckMail option in sshd_config is deprecated, sshd no longer
   checks for new mail.

3) X11 cookies are stored in $HOME

### [OpenSSH 2.9](txt/release-2.9)/[2.9p1](txt/release-2.9) (2001-04-29)

```

OpenSSH 2.9 has just been uploaded. It is available from the
mirrors listed at <https://www.openssh.com/>.
OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

WARNING: SSH protocol v2 is now the default protocol version

	use the 'Protocol' option from [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) and [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8) if
	you want to change this.

SSH protocol v2 implementation adds support for:

        HostbasedAuthentication, similar to RhostsRSA in SSH protocol
        v1

        Rekeying (negotiate new encryption keys for the current SSH
        session, try ~R in interactive SSH sessions)

        updated DH group exchange:
        	draft-ietf-secsh-dh-group-exchange-01.txt

        client option HostKeyAlgorithms

        server options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax

        tty mode passing

general:

        gid swapping in sshd (fixes access to /home/group/user based
        directory structures)

        Dan Kaminsky <dankamin@cisco.com> contributed an experimental
        SOCKS4 proxy to the ssh client (yes, client not the server).
        Use 'ssh -D 1080 server' if you want to try this out.

	server option PrintLastLog

	improvements for scp > 2GB

	improved ListenAddress option.
	You can now use ListenAddress host:port

	improved interoperability (bug detection for older implementations)

	improved documentation

### [OpenSSH 2.5.2p2](txt/release-2.5.2p2) (2001-03-22)

```

Portable OpenSSH 2.5.2p2 is now available from the mirror sites
listed at <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>

Security related changes:
	Improved countermeasure against "Passive Analysis of SSH
	(Secure Shell) Traffic"
	<http://openwall.com/advisories/OW-003-ssh-traffic-analysis.txt>

	The countermeasures introduced in earlier OpenSSH-2.5.x versions
	caused interoperability problems with some other implementations.

	Improved countermeasure against "SSH protocol 1.5 session
	key recovery vulnerability"
	<http://www.core-sdi.com/advisories/ssh1_sessionkey_recovery.htm>

New options:
	permitopen authorized_keys option to restrict portforwarding.

	PreferredAuthentications allows client to specify the order in which
	authentication methods are tried.

Sftp:
	sftp client supports globbing (get *, put *).

	Support for sftp protocol v3 (draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-01.txt).

	Batch file (-b) support for automated transfers

Performance:
	Speedup DH exchange. OpenSSH should now be significantly faster when
	connecting use SSH protocol 2.

	Preferred SSH protocol 2 cipher is AES with hmac-md5. AES offers
	much faster throughput in a well scrutinised cipher.

Bugfixes:
	stderr handling fixes in SSH protocol 2.

	Improved interoperability.

Client:
	The client no longer asks for the the passphrase if the key
	will not be accepted by the server (SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK)

Miscellaneous:
	scp should now work for files > 2GB

	ssh-keygen can now generate fingerprints in the "bubble babble"
	format for exchanging fingerprints with SSH.COM's SSH protocol 2
	implementation.

Portable version:
	Better support for the PRNGd[1] entropy collection daemon. The
	--with-egd-pool configure option has been deprecated in favour
	of --with-prngd-socket and the new --with-prngd-port options.
	The latter allows collection of entropy from a localhost
	socket.

	configure ensures that scp is in the $PATH set by the server
	(unless a custom path is specified).

### [OpenSSH 2.5.1p2](txt/release-2.5.1p2) (2001-03-20)

```

Portable OpenSSH 2.5.1p2 has just been uploaded and will be making its
way to the mirror sites (<http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>)in due
course.

This release contains primarily bug-fixes over 2.5.1p1 but an upgrade is
recommended. Specific bug-fixes include:

 - Fixed endianess issue causing failues when usin Rijndael/AES cipher
 - Fix PAM failures on Solaris and Linux
 - Fix RPM spec file for Redhat systems
 - Fixed several compatibility functions
 - Fix entropy collection code for SCO3 and NeXTStep
 - Many other minor fixes (see Changelog for details)

This release includes Mark Roth's mdoc2man.pl script which can be used
to fix up the manpages on systems that lack the full andoc set of
macros (e.g. Solaris). A future release of portable OpenSSH will automate
this scripts use for systems that require it.

### [OpenSSH 2.5.1p1](txt/release-2.5.1p1) (2001-02-19)

```

Portable OpenSSH 2.5.1p1 has just been uploaded. It will be available
from the mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH 1.3 & 1.5 protocol implementation and
a 99% SSH 2 protocol implementation, including sftp client and server
support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

OpenSSH 2.5.0p1 was skipped because of interoperability issues with
ssh-1.2.18 => ssh-1.2.22.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued support
and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

1) Features added to the implementation of the SSH 2 protocol:

    * agent forwarding
    * support for -R forwarding
    * RSA host and userkeys
    * extended support for older SSH 2 protocol implementations

    OpenSSH still lacks support for rekeying, so you have to turn off
    rekeying if your server tries to force this feature.

    The next release of OpenSSH will probably support rekeying.

2) Damien Miller contributed an interactive sftp client.

    The sftp client works for both SSH protocol versions.

3) David Mazieres' ssh-keyscan has been added to the OpenSSH distribution.

4) Now there are three types of keys in OpenSSH:

    RSA1 is used by the SSH 1 protocol only,
    RSA and DSA keys are used by the SSH 2 protocol implementation.

    You can generate RSA keys for use with SSH 2 protocol with:

        $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key

        To use RSA or DSA keys in SSH 2 protocol, simply
        add the public keys to the .ssh/authorised_keys2 file.

    IdentityFile2, HostDsaKey and DSAAuthentication are obsolete:

    You can use multiple IdentityFile and HostKey options instead, e.g
        HostKey /etc/ssh_host_key
        HostKey /etc/ssh_host_dsa_key
        HostKey /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key
    in /etc/sshd_config

    The option DSAAuthentication has been replaced by PubkeyAuthentication.

    Fingerprinting works for all types of keys:

        $ ssh-keygen -l -f $HOME/.ssh/{authorized_keys,known_hosts}{,2}

5) Important changes in the implementation of SSH 1 protocol:

    The OpenSSH server does not require a privileged source port for
    RhostsRsaAuthentication, since it adds no additional security.

    Interoperation with SSH 1.4 protocol

6) New option HostKeyAlias

    This option allows the user to record the host key under a
    different name. This is useful for tunneling over
    forwarded connections or if you run multiple sshd's on
    different ports on the same machine.

    Alternatively you can use the UserKnownHostsFile or
    UserKnownHostsFile2 options to specify seperate host key
    files for the connection.

7) The ReverseMappingCheck is now optional in sshd_config.

    If you combine this with the 'sshd -u0' option the server
    will not do DNS lookups when a client connects.

8) Stricter Hostkey Checking

9) Option Change Summary:

    a) New or changed:

        ChallengeResponseAuthentication
        MACs
        PubkeyAuthentication

        HostkeyAlias        (Client only)

        Banner              (Server only)
        ReverseMappingCheck (Server only)

        PermitRootLogin     {yes,without-password,forced-commands-only,no}

        {Allow,Deny}Groups  now support supplementary groups

        sshd -D             for monitoring scripts or inittab
        ssh -t              multiple -t force tty allocation

    b) Obsolete:

        DsaAuthentication   (use PubkeyAuthentication instead)
        HostDsaKey          (use HostKey)
        Identityfile2       (use Identityfile or -i)
        SkeyAuthentication  (use ChallengeResponseAuthentication)
        TisAuthentication   (use ChallengeResponseAuthentication)

### [OpenSSH 2.3.0p1](txt/release-2.3.0p1) (2000-11-06)

```

This is to announce the release of portable openssh-2.3.0p1. This
release includes many new features and bug fixes. This is a
recommended upgrade if you are using 2.2.0p1 or an older release.

Portable OpenSSH is available from one of the many mirrors listed at
<http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>

Some of the more notable features include:

- Rijndael support for SSH2. Use the "Ciphers" configuration directive
  to enable it. (Markus Friedl <markus@cvs.openbsd.org>

- Cygwin support (Corinna Vinschen <vinschen@cygnus.com>)

- sftp-server support (Markus Friedl <markus@cvs.openbsd.org>)

- SSH1 single-des support for interop with Cisco routers. This cipher
  is never enabled automatically, you have to either specify "-c des"
  or enable it using "Cipher des" in a config file. (Markus Friedl
  <markus@cvs.openbsd.org>

- Support expired password change through PAM (Steve VanDevender's
  <stevev@darkwing.uoregon.edu>)

- Better compatibility with buggy SSH implementations (Markus Friedl
  <markus@cvs.openbsd.org>

- S/key support for SSH2, based on kbd-interactive auth (Markus Friedl
  <markus@cvs.openbsd.org> and mkiernan@avantgo.com

- scp now supports "-o" option (Ben Lindstron <mouring@pconline.com>)

Please refer to the ChangeLog for a full list of features and bugfixes.

### [OpenSSH 2.2.0p1](txt/release-2.2.0p1) (2000-09-01)

```

Version 2.2.0p1 of portable OpenSSH has just been uploaded to the
master site and should be making its way to the mirrors in due
course.

<http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>

This release contains several new features and bugfixes relative to
the previous 2.1.1p4 release. In particular:

- DSA key support in ssh-agent. Please not that this will not
  interop with ssh.com's ssh-agent (Markus Friedl)
- sshd now implements Random Early Drop connection rate limiting,
  which can help mitigate DoS attacks against sshd. See the
  `MaxStartups' option in the sshd manpage for details (Markus Friedl)
- `-u' option to sshd allow logging of hostnames (rather than IP
  addresses) in wtmp when `UseLogin' is set to `yes'. (Markus Friedl)
- Escape character `~' support in SSH2 (Markus Friedl)
- Interop with SSH.COM ssh 2.3.0 (Markus Friedl)
- Fix problems when sshd is run from inetd
- Better SunOS 4.1.x support (Nate Itkin and Charles Levert)
- Solaris package support, see contrib/solaris (Rip Loomis)
- Work around connection freezes on HPUX and SunOS 4 (Lutz Jaenicke,
  Tamito KAJIYAMA)
- Fix ^C ignored issue on Solaris. (Gert Doering, John Horne and
  Garrick James)
- Further improved NeXT support. (Ben Lindstrom, Mark Miller)
- Lots of other minor fixes (see ChangeLog for details)

This release has been tested on HPUX (10.20, 11.00), Irix (5.3,
6.5), Linux (Debian, Redhat, Slackware, SuSE), NeXTstep 3 (HPPA,
i386, m68k), OpenStep (i386, m68k, Sparc), SCO Unixware 7.1.0, SCO
OpenServer 5.0.5, Solaris 2.7 (Sparc), Solaris 2.8 (i386, Sparc),

### [OpenSSH 2.1.1p3](txt/release-2.1.1p3) (2000-07-12)

```

The 2.1.1p3 release of portable OpenSSH has been uploaded to the
OpenBSD ftp master site. In a few hours it will be available from one
of the many mirrors listed at:

<http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>

This release fixes several bugs reported since the previous release
and extends portability to NeXT and Reliant Unix.

As usual, the OpenBSD team has been hard at work further polishing and
enhancing OpenSSH. This release brings a new configuration directive
"MaxStartups" which mitigates connection flooding attacks, further
details are in the sshd man-page.

Another noteworthy difference from previous releases is that
'FallBackToRsh' now defaults to 'no'. Users of this feature may need
to edit their /etc/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config files to achieve the
same behavior.

Again, thanks to those who reported bugs, tested the snapshot and sent
fixes.

Regards,
Damien Miller

### [OpenSSH 2.1.1p1](txt/release-2.1.1p1) (2000-06-09)

```

Announcing the availability of portable OpenSSH 2.1.1p1.

This release contains the fix for the "UseLogin yes" vulnerability
identified in Markus' release and several other enhancements and
bugfixes. Including:

 - Better login code. Andre Lucas has rewritten the login code to
   be much more modular and extensible. In the process he has fixed
   the problems with Solaris utmp[x].

 - Revised the entropy collection code to be faster and more reliable.

 - Fix for RSA host restrictions ("from=" in authorized_keys)

It is recommended that all users upgrade to this version.

Portable OpenSSH 2.1.1p1 is available from one of the many mirrors
listed at: <http://www.openssh.com/portable.html>

Regards,
Damien Miller

```

### [OpenSSH 2.1.0p1](txt/release-2.1.0p1) (2000-05-09)

```

This is to announce the release of openssh-2.1.0, the first stable
release of portable OpenSSH to incorporate support for the SSH2
protocol.

The SSH2 protocol offers a number of advantages over the SSH1 protocol
including standards compliance (SSH2 is on the IETF standards
track[1]), improved security and operation without RSA (which is
patented in some countries).

The SSH2 support in OpenSSH has been developed by Markus Friedl, with
support from the OpenBSD team.

This is also the first version of the portable version of OpenSSH
to offer built-in entropy collection. This removes the requirement
for EGD on systems that lack a /dev/random driver. As a result,
OpenSSH-2.1.0 now requires a recent version of OpenSSL[2] to compile
(version 0.9.5 or later).

NB. The portable version of OpenSSH is currently in the
process of merging its webpages with the official OpenBSD
project. Please use <http://www.openssh.com/> from now
on. Distribution files are also available from the mirrors listed at
<http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html>

Please read <http://www.openssh.com/report.html> before reporting bugs.
Patches, bug reports, developer and user queries are welcome on the
mailing list ([http://www.openssh.com/list.html)](http://www.openssh.com/list.html%29).

### [OpenSSH 1.2.3p1](txt/release-1.2.3p1) (2000-03-24)

```

The Unix/Linux port of OpenSSH 1.2.3 was released yesterday and should
be available from a mirror near you. A mirror list is available from:

<http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html>

This release fixes the bugs reported since 1.2.2p1 and contains many
cleanups from the OpenBSD tree.

In particular, the OpenSSL detection problems have been resolved.

The layout has changed a little bit. The packages/ subdirectory has
been replaced with a contrib/ subdirectory which contains platform
specific code and other patches. Submissions are welcome.

Enjoy,
Damien Miller

### [OpenSSH 1.2.2p1](txt/release-1.2.2p1) (2000-03-05)

```

It gives me no little pleasure to announce the first stable release
of the Unix port of OpenSSH.

It is available in tar.gz and RPM format from one of the mirrors
listed at:

<http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/files/MIRRORS.html>

This release fixes all known issues and is known to compile and
function on (at least) recent releases on Linux, Solaris, HPUX and SCO
Unixware.

Please review the ChangeLog[1] for details on what has changed since
the last release.

I am holding off on a wider announcement until the mirrors have
updated.

Thanks to everyone who assisted with testing, bug reports, success
stories and most of all, patches :) Special thanks to the OpenBSD
developers for giving us OpenSSH to begin with.

Regards,
Damien Miller

Message-ID: <3b1ca587d1faad82@openbsd.org>
Date: Tue, 8 Oct 2019 20:41:56 -0600 (MDT)
From: Damien Miller <djm@...nbsd.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Announce: OpenSSH 8.1 released

OpenSSH 8.1 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Security
========

 * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1): an exploitable integer
   overflow bug was found in the private key parsing code for the XMSS
   key type. This key type is still experimental and support for it is
   not compiled by default. No user-facing autoconf option exists in
   portable OpenSSH to enable it. This bug was found by Adam Zabrocki
   and reported via SecuriTeam's SSD program.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-agent(1): add protection for private keys at
   rest in RAM against speculation and memory side-channel attacks like
   Spectre, Meltdown and Rambleed. This release encrypts private keys
   when they are not in use with a symmetric key that is derived from a
   relatively large "prekey" consisting of random data (currently 16KB).

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * ssh-keygen(1): when acting as a CA and signing certificates with
   an RSA key, default to using the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm.
   Certificates signed by RSA keys will therefore be incompatible
   with OpenSSH versions prior to 7.2 unless the default is
   overridden (using "ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa -s ...").

Changes since OpenSSH 8.0
=========================

This release is focused on bug-fixing.

New Features
------------

 * ssh(1): Allow %n to be expanded in ProxyCommand strings

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Allow prepending a list of algorithms to the
   default set by starting the list with the '^' character, E.g.
   "HostKeyAlgorithms ^ssh-ed25519"

 * ssh-keygen(1): add an experimental lightweight signature and
   verification ability. Signatures may be made using regular ssh keys
   held on disk or stored in a ssh-agent and verified against an
   authorized_keys-like list of allowed keys. Signatures embed a
   namespace that prevents confusion and attacks between different
   usage domains (e.g. files vs email).

 * ssh-keygen(1): print key comment when extracting public key from a
   private key.  bz#3052

 * ssh-keygen(1): accept the verbose flag when searching for host keys
   in known hosts (i.e. "ssh-keygen -vF host") to print the matching
   host's random-art signature too. bz#3003

 * All: support PKCS8 as an optional format for storage of private
   keys to disk.  The OpenSSH native key format remains the default,
   but PKCS8 is a superior format to PEM if interoperability with
   non-OpenSSH software is required, as it may use a less insecure
   key derivation function than PEM's.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1): if a PKCS#11 token returns no keys then try to login and
   refetch them. Based on patch from Jakub Jelen; bz#2430

 * ssh(1): produce a useful error message if the user's shell is set
   incorrectly during "match exec" processing. bz#2791

 * sftp(1): allow the maximum uint32 value for the argument passed
   to -b which allows better error messages from later validation.
   bz#3050

 * ssh(1): avoid pledge sandbox violations in some combinations of
   remote forwarding, connection multiplexing and ControlMaster.

 * ssh-keyscan(1): include SHA2-variant RSA key algorithms in KEX
   proposal; allows ssh-keyscan to harvest keys from servers that
   disable old SHA1 ssh-rsa. bz#3029

 * sftp(1): print explicit "not modified" message if a file was
   requested for resumed download but was considered already complete.
   bz#2978

 * sftp(1): fix a typo and make <esc><right> move right to the
   closest end of a word just like <esc><left> moves left to the
   closest beginning of a word.

 * sshd(8): cap the number of permitopen/permitlisten directives
   allowed to appear on a single authorized_keys line.

 * All: fix a number of memory leaks (one-off or on exit paths).

 * Regression tests: a number of fixes and improvements, including
   fixes to the interop tests, adding the ability to run most tests
   on builds that disable OpenSSL support, better support for running
   tests under Valgrind and a number of bug-fixes.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): check for convtime() refusing to accept times that
   resolve to LONG_MAX Reported by Kirk Wolf bz2977

 * ssh(1): slightly more instructive error message when the user
   specifies multiple -J options on the command-line. bz3015

 * ssh-agent(1): process agent requests for RSA certificate private
   keys using correct signature algorithm when requested. bz3016

 * sftp(1): check for user@...t when parsing sftp target. This
   allows user@[1.2.3.4] to work without a path.  bz#2999

 * sshd(8): enlarge format buffer size for certificate serial
   number so the log message can record any 64-bit integer without
   truncation. bz#3012

 * sshd(8): for PermitOpen violations add the remote host and port to
   be able to more easily ascertain the source of the request. Add the
   same logging for PermitListen violations which where not previously
   logged at all.

 * scp(1), sftp(1): use the correct POSIX format style for left
   justification for the transfer progress meter. bz#3002

 * sshd(8) when examining a configuration using sshd -T, assume any
   attribute not provided by -C does not match, which allows it to work
   when sshd_config contains a Match directive with or without -C.
   bz#2858

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): downgrade PKCS#11 "provider returned no
   slots" warning from log level error to debug. This is common when
   attempting to enumerate keys on smartcard readers with no cards
   plugged in. bz#3058

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): do not unconditionally log in to PKCS#11
   tokens. Avoids spurious PIN prompts for keys not selected for
   authentication in ssh(1) and when listing public keys available in
   a token using ssh-keygen(1). bz#3006

Portability
-----------

 * ssh(1): fix SIGWINCH delivery of Solaris for multiplexed sessions
   bz#3030

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix typo that prevented detection of Linux VRF

 * sshd(8): add no-op implementation of pam_putenv to avoid build
   breakage on platforms where the PAM implementation lacks this
   function (e.g. HP-UX). bz#3008

 * sftp-server(8): fix Solaris privilege sandbox from preventing
   the legacy sftp rename operation from working (was refusing to
   allow hard links to files owned by other users). bz#3036

 * All: add a proc_pidinfo()-based closefrom() for OS X to avoid
   the need to brute-force close all high-numbered file descriptors.
   bz#3049

 * sshd(8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow mprotect(2) with
   PROT_(READ|WRITE|NONE) only. This syscall is used by some hardened
   heap allocators. Github PR#142

 * sshd(8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow the s390-specific
   ioctl for ECC hardware support.

 * All: use "doc" man page format if the mandoc(1) tool is present on
   the system. Previously configure would not select the "doc" man
   page format if mandoc was present but nroff was not.

 * sshd(8): don't install duplicate STREAMS modules on Solaris; check
   if STREAMS modules are already installed on a pty before installing
   since when compiling with XPG>=4 they will likely be installed
   already. Prevents hangs and duplicate lines on the terminal.
   bz#2945 and bz#2998,

# OpenSSH: Integer overflow — GLSA **201911-01**

An integer overflow in OpenSSH might allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/openssh** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | >= **8.0\_p1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **8.0\_p1-r4** |

### Background

OpenSSH is a complete SSH protocol implementation that includes SFTP
client and server support.

### Description

OpenSSH, when built with “xmss” USE flag enabled, has a
pre-authentication integer overflow if a client or server is configured
to use a crafted XMSS key.

NOTE: This USE flag is disabled by default!

### Impact

A remote attacker could connect to a vulnerable OpenSSH server using a
special crafted XMSS key possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

Disable XMSS key type.

### Resolution

All OpenSSH users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=net-misc/openssh/openssh-8.0_p1-r4"

```

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

fix shield/unshield for xmss keys:

When system calls indicate an error they return -1, not some arbitrary
value < 0.  errno is only updated in this case.  Change all (most?)
callers of syscalls to follow this better, and let's see if this strictness
helps us in the future.

Message-ID: <3b1ca587d1faad82@openbsd.org>
Date: Tue, 8 Oct 2019 20:41:56 -0600 (MDT)
From: Damien Miller <djm@...nbsd.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: Announce: OpenSSH 8.1 released

OpenSSH 8.1 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at <http://www.openssh.com/> shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their
continued support of the project, especially those who contributed
code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the
project. More information on donations may be found at:
<http://www.openssh.com/donations.html>

Security
========

 * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-add(1), ssh-keygen(1): an exploitable integer
   overflow bug was found in the private key parsing code for the XMSS
   key type. This key type is still experimental and support for it is
   not compiled by default. No user-facing autoconf option exists in
   portable OpenSSH to enable it. This bug was found by Adam Zabrocki
   and reported via SecuriTeam's SSD program.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8), ssh-agent(1): add protection for private keys at
   rest in RAM against speculation and memory side-channel attacks like
   Spectre, Meltdown and Rambleed. This release encrypts private keys
   when they are not in use with a symmetric key that is derived from a
   relatively large "prekey" consisting of random data (currently 16KB).

Potentially-incompatible changes
================================

This release includes a number of changes that may affect existing
configurations:

 * ssh-keygen(1): when acting as a CA and signing certificates with
   an RSA key, default to using the rsa-sha2-512 signature algorithm.
   Certificates signed by RSA keys will therefore be incompatible
   with OpenSSH versions prior to 7.2 unless the default is
   overridden (using "ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa -s ...").

Changes since OpenSSH 8.0
=========================

This release is focused on bug-fixing.

New Features
------------

 * ssh(1): Allow %n to be expanded in ProxyCommand strings

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Allow prepending a list of algorithms to the
   default set by starting the list with the '^' character, E.g.
   "HostKeyAlgorithms ^ssh-ed25519"

 * ssh-keygen(1): add an experimental lightweight signature and
   verification ability. Signatures may be made using regular ssh keys
   held on disk or stored in a ssh-agent and verified against an
   authorized_keys-like list of allowed keys. Signatures embed a
   namespace that prevents confusion and attacks between different
   usage domains (e.g. files vs email).

 * ssh-keygen(1): print key comment when extracting public key from a
   private key.  bz#3052

 * ssh-keygen(1): accept the verbose flag when searching for host keys
   in known hosts (i.e. "ssh-keygen -vF host") to print the matching
   host's random-art signature too. bz#3003

 * All: support PKCS8 as an optional format for storage of private
   keys to disk.  The OpenSSH native key format remains the default,
   but PKCS8 is a superior format to PEM if interoperability with
   non-OpenSSH software is required, as it may use a less insecure
   key derivation function than PEM's.

Bugfixes
--------

 * ssh(1): if a PKCS#11 token returns no keys then try to login and
   refetch them. Based on patch from Jakub Jelen; bz#2430

 * ssh(1): produce a useful error message if the user's shell is set
   incorrectly during "match exec" processing. bz#2791

 * sftp(1): allow the maximum uint32 value for the argument passed
   to -b which allows better error messages from later validation.
   bz#3050

 * ssh(1): avoid pledge sandbox violations in some combinations of
   remote forwarding, connection multiplexing and ControlMaster.

 * ssh-keyscan(1): include SHA2-variant RSA key algorithms in KEX
   proposal; allows ssh-keyscan to harvest keys from servers that
   disable old SHA1 ssh-rsa. bz#3029

 * sftp(1): print explicit "not modified" message if a file was
   requested for resumed download but was considered already complete.
   bz#2978

 * sftp(1): fix a typo and make <esc><right> move right to the
   closest end of a word just like <esc><left> moves left to the
   closest beginning of a word.

 * sshd(8): cap the number of permitopen/permitlisten directives
   allowed to appear on a single authorized_keys line.

 * All: fix a number of memory leaks (one-off or on exit paths).

 * Regression tests: a number of fixes and improvements, including
   fixes to the interop tests, adding the ability to run most tests
   on builds that disable OpenSSL support, better support for running
   tests under Valgrind and a number of bug-fixes.

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): check for convtime() refusing to accept times that
   resolve to LONG_MAX Reported by Kirk Wolf bz2977

 * ssh(1): slightly more instructive error message when the user
   specifies multiple -J options on the command-line. bz3015

 * ssh-agent(1): process agent requests for RSA certificate private
   keys using correct signature algorithm when requested. bz3016

 * sftp(1): check for user@...t when parsing sftp target. This
   allows user@[1.2.3.4] to work without a path.  bz#2999

 * sshd(8): enlarge format buffer size for certificate serial
   number so the log message can record any 64-bit integer without
   truncation. bz#3012

 * sshd(8): for PermitOpen violations add the remote host and port to
   be able to more easily ascertain the source of the request. Add the
   same logging for PermitListen violations which where not previously
   logged at all.

 * scp(1), sftp(1): use the correct POSIX format style for left
   justification for the transfer progress meter. bz#3002

 * sshd(8) when examining a configuration using sshd -T, assume any
   attribute not provided by -C does not match, which allows it to work
   when sshd_config contains a Match directive with or without -C.
   bz#2858

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): downgrade PKCS#11 "provider returned no
   slots" warning from log level error to debug. This is common when
   attempting to enumerate keys on smartcard readers with no cards
   plugged in. bz#3058

 * ssh(1), ssh-keygen(1): do not unconditionally log in to PKCS#11
   tokens. Avoids spurious PIN prompts for keys not selected for
   authentication in ssh(1) and when listing public keys available in
   a token using ssh-keygen(1). bz#3006

Portability
-----------

 * ssh(1): fix SIGWINCH delivery of Solaris for multiplexed sessions
   bz#3030

 * ssh(1), sshd(8): fix typo that prevented detection of Linux VRF

 * sshd(8): add no-op implementation of pam_putenv to avoid build
   breakage on platforms where the PAM implementation lacks this
   function (e.g. HP-UX). bz#3008

 * sftp-server(8): fix Solaris privilege sandbox from preventing
   the legacy sftp rename operation from working (was refusing to
   allow hard links to files owned by other users). bz#3036

 * All: add a proc_pidinfo()-based closefrom() for OS X to avoid
   the need to brute-force close all high-numbered file descriptors.
   bz#3049

 * sshd(8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow mprotect(2) with
   PROT_(READ|WRITE|NONE) only. This syscall is used by some hardened
   heap allocators. Github PR#142

 * sshd(8): in the Linux seccomp-bpf sandbox, allow the s390-specific
   ioctl for ECC hardware support.

 * All: use "doc" man page format if the mandoc(1) tool is present on
   the system. Previously configure would not select the "doc" man
   page format if mandoc was present but nroff was not.

 * sshd(8): don't install duplicate STREAMS modules on Solaris; check
   if STREAMS modules are already installed on a pty before installing
   since when compiling with XPG>=4 they will likely be installed
   already. Prevents hangs and duplicate lines on the terminal.
   bz#2945 and bz#2998,

Checksums:
==========

 - SHA1 (openssh-8.1.tar.gz) = bf7b0c65a7c0afa5ba9c787f345b8a24fa459add
 - SHA256 (openssh-8.1.tar.gz) = vamkKxZTFfgxQXSxGeJ1vbuot0H3Vx9bNBgrvChSrFg=

 - SHA1 (openssh-8.1p1.tar.gz) = c44b96094869f177735ae053d92bd5fcab1319de
 - SHA256 (openssh-8.1p1.tar.gz) = AvXb7zg10HU1VvlzzVe0wZtrH2zSTANEXiOsd8obk/8=

Please note that the SHA256 signatures are base64 encoded and not
hexadecimal (which is the default for most checksum tools). The PGP
key used to sign the releases is available as RELEASE_KEY.asc from
the mirror sites.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1153537#c0)  Robert Frohl   2019-10-10 08:03:39 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16905  OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a pre-authentication integer overflow if a client or server is configured to use a crafted XMSS key. This leads to memory corruption and remote code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

But the algorithm was not enabled there.   Which means we are not affected anywhere as far as I can tell. ``` |  |
