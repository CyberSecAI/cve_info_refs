Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause for all five SQL injection vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `phpipam` application. Specifically, the `table` parameter in the HTTP POST request to the listed files is directly used in SQL queries without any validation or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is incorporated into SQL queries, enabling attackers to manipulate the database.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `table` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Direct Parameter Use:** The vulnerable files use the POST `table` parameter directly in SQL queries which is a primary cause for this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could achieve the following:
- **Information Disclosure:** Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, IP address information), as demonstrated by the user() example.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** Alter or delete existing data in the database.
- **Denial of Service:** Execute time-consuming queries using SQL injection to cause a denial of service (e.g., using `sleep()` function).
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges within the application or database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the following PHP files, providing a malicious `table` parameter:
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit-result.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter-result.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/order.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the phpipam application.
- **HTTP Request Capability:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests.
- **Authentication (Potentially):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided issue, it can be inferred that some level of authentication may be necessary to access the vulnerable files, as session cookies (`phpipam`) are present in the requests. However, the exact authentication requirements are not clear from the provided description.

**Specific Vulnerability Details:**
The issue describes 5 specific vulnerabilities:
  - **Vulnerability 1:** Uses `updatexml()` to extract database information.
  - **Vulnerability 2:** Uses `sleep()` to demonstrate a time-based SQL injection.
  - **Vulnerability 3:** Similar to Vulnerability 1, using `updatexml()` for information disclosure.
  - **Vulnerability 4:** Similar to Vulnerability 1 and 3.
  - **Vulnerability 5:** Similar to Vulnerability 2, using `sleep()` to demonstrate a time-based SQL injection.
