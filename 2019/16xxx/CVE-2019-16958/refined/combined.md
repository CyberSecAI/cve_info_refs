### Free Ticketing Software - Web Help Desk Free Edition

The free help desk ticketing system from SolarWinds empowers you to manage service tickets by tracking their lifecycles—from ticket creation to resolution—in a single centralized, web-based interface. By storing all this data in a single location, the Web Help Desk free support ticket system can link multiple incidents to a problem, facilitating efficient ticket management and allowing you to resolve more tickets, faster. The Web Help Desk free ticketing system makes it easy to track ticket status and technician performance, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of your help desk.

Web Help Desk free support ticket system also gives end users access to an extensive database featuring answers to many common questions. This built-in database helps end users resolve straightforward issues on their own, minimizing the number of inbound service requests your team receives.

Additionally, the Web Help Desk free ticketing system comes equipped with service level agreement ([SLA](https://www.solarwinds.com/web-help-desk/use-cases/sla-management-monitoring-reports)) tracking and management capabilities, including alerts for imminent SLA breaches and date-specific SLA reminders. These capabilities help ensure you maintain your SLA obligations and notice potential breaches before they occur.

### An Even More Sophisticated Suite of Help Desk Services

Web Help Desk IT ticketing system free version is ideal for smaller companies looking to take care of the fundamentals of service ticket management. However, if your organization is seeking a more comprehensive solution, [SolarWinds® Web Help Desk® (WHD)](https://www.solarwinds.com/web-help-desk) provides a full suite of services designed to elevate your help desk operations to the next level.

Equipped with all the same capabilities as the free ticketing system and then some, Web Help Desk is built to drastically reduce the amount of time IT technicians spend manually creating, routing, and escalating tickets. The platform replaces these time-consuming tasks with an automated system to allow your team to focus on what matters most: resolving tickets efficiently and effectively. Recurring tasks like employee onboarding or new infrastructure migration can also be automated.

The automation capabilities extend to asset management, helping you automatically discover and keep track of your company’s [hardware inventory](https://www.solarwinds.com/web-help-desk/use-cases/hardware-inventory) and software assets—from laptops to software licenses—from a central dashboard. This enables asset-to-ticket association, streamlining your team’s operations even further while helping you keep tabs on the health and status of your asset inventory.

### Take the Next Step to Improve Your Help Desk Strategy

The extensive capabilities of Web Help Desk are designed to enhance your department’s productivity. With SolarWinds WHD, you don’t have to worry about wasted time, extensive delays in service request resolutions, or poor help desk performance. The platform arms you with in-depth, actionable insights into your entire ticketing system and [asset management](https://www.solarwinds.com/web-help-desk/use-cases/it-asset-management), helping you deliver unprecedentedly consistent results.
