The content provided describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpIPAM.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `table` parameter in multiple files, before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the following files:
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/edit-result.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/filter-result.php`
  - `/app/admin/custom-fields/order.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database by using functions like `user()` or other queries.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can cause delays by injecting sleep statements in the queries.
- Potential to perform other malicious actions by executing arbitrary SQL commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable files, including malicious SQL statements in the `table` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable files.
- It is implied that the attacker needs to have access to the application, at least to some extent, to trigger the vulnerable code. The content does not specify if any authentication is required.

The provided content gives more specific details compared to the general CVE description by listing vulnerable files and providing example requests to trigger the vulnerabilities. It also details the ability to extract database user information and cause delays using sleep statements, which are specific examples of SQL injection exploitation techniques.
