  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the 'category' parameter within the /subscribe/ endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific exploit, the attacker retrieves the username and password hash from the 'admin' table.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST request to the /subscribe/ endpoint with a crafted 'category' parameter"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special user privileges on the application are needed."
