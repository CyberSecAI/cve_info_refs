Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `music_on_hold.php` file of FusionPBX. The application uses an unsanitized "file" variable obtained from the URL. This variable is then base64 decoded to form a file path. Critically, the application does not properly sanitize this decoded path, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal, caused by the lack of sanitization of the "file" URL parameter after base64 decoding. This allows an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The application directly uses user-supplied input to construct file paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download any file from the server that is accessible by the web server user. This can include sensitive configuration files, database backups, application source code, and more. This can lead to information disclosure, which may further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a URL with a base64-encoded path in the "file" parameter.
- **Direct URL access:** No interaction with other users needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the FusionPBX application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the FusionPBX web server.
- **Base64 Encoding Knowledge:** The attacker must know that the path is base64 encoded.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Pierre Jourdan on 15/08/2019, and fixed on 19/08/2019
- The vulnerability is present in FusionPBX up to version 4.5.7
- The provided GitHub commit (`95ed18aa9d781f232f5686a9027bb6f677c9b8da`) shows the fix, which involves a `str_replace('../', '', $stream_full_path);` to prevent path traversal.
- The NVD base score is 6.5 (MEDIUM).
