{
  "CVE-2019-16732": {
    "Root cause": "The pet feeders download firmware updates over unencrypted HTTP, lacking cryptographic validation of the downloaded firmware.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Lack of transit encryption",
      "No cryptographic validation of firmware"
    ],
    "Impact": "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attackers can modify firmware images during transit, allowing arbitrary code execution on the pet feeder.",
    "Attack vector": "Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack during firmware update process.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept and modify network traffic during firmware update."
  }
