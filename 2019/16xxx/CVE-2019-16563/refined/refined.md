### Vulnerability Summary:
The Mission Control Plugin 0.9.16 and earlier versions are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting (XSS). This occurs because the plugin does not properly escape job display names and build names within the view it provides.

### Impact of Exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into job display names and build names. When other users view the affected view, the injected scripts are executed in their browsers, potentially leading to:

*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the Jenkins interface
*   Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim user

### Attack Vector:
An attacker with the ability to change job display names or build names can inject XSS payloads into these properties.

### Required Capabilities:
To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to have the "Overall/Read" access and the ability to modify job or build configurations, which allows them to inject malicious code into the job display names and build names.
