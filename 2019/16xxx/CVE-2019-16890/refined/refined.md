The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16890.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the `authorUrl` parameter in the `BaseCommentServiceImpl`. Specifically, the `URLUtil.normalize` function does not properly handle `javascript:` URLs, allowing for injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The malicious payload is stored in the database and executed when other users view the comment.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers.
- The attacker can steal sensitive information such as the `halo__Access-Token` stored in the browser's localStorage.
- This token can be used to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL within the `authorUrl` parameter of a comment, such as `javascript:alert(localStorage.getItem('halo__Access-Token'));//://`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to post a comment on the affected system.
- No special privileges are required to post a comment, so any user can trigger the vulnerability.
