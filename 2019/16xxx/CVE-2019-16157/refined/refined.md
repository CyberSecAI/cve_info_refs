Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an information exposure issue within the FortiWeb CLI. Specifically, when a user changes their password, sensitive information is logged and can be viewed using `diagnose debug` commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Exposure: The system logs sensitive information during password changes that are not adequately protected.
- Insecure Logging: The logging mechanism captures sensitive data and makes it accessible through debugging tools.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker who has authenticated access can use `diagnose debug` commands to view the sensitive information logged during password changes, potentially revealing user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- CLI access: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the FortiWeb CLI.
- `diagnose debug` command: The attacker exploits the debugging command to extract the logged information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated CLI user: The attacker must have valid credentials to access the FortiWeb CLI.
- Ability to execute commands: The attacker needs to be able to execute `diagnose debug` commands.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects FortiWeb versions 6.2.0 and below.
- The vulnerability was reported by Danilo Costa from PBI.
- The CVSSv3 score is 5.4 with the vector string AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
- The issue is resolved in FortiWeb version 6.3.0, 6.2.1 or above.
