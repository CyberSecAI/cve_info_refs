Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16566:

**CVE-2019-16566**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Team Concert Plugin 1.3.0 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The Team Concert Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission check. The plugin allows users with Overall/Read access to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs.
*  **Attack Vector:** Network. An attacker can leverage the vulnerability through a crafted request to the Jenkins server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance. They must also obtain valid credential IDs via another vulnerability (CVE-2019-16567).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The attacker can capture credentials stored in Jenkins by connecting to an attacker-specified URL with specified credentials IDs.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a form validation method in the plugin.
*   This vulnerability is paired with a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2019-16565) in the same method, which exacerbates the issue by allowing unauthenticated access.
*   There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the publication of the security advisory.
*   The plugin also has a separate vulnerability (CVE-2019-16567) that allows enumeration of credential IDs by users with Overall/Read access which can be used in conjunction with CVE-2019-16566.
