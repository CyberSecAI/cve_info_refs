# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

## Descriptions

### XXE vulnerability in Maven Release Plug-in Plugin

**SECURITY-1681
/
CVE-2019-16549 (XXE), CVE-2019-16550 (CSRF)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager APIs.
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if it’s not an HTTPS URL.

Additionally, a connection test form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow attackers to have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.2 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
It also now requires that requests to the connection test form validation method are done via POST, which protects from cross-site request forgery attacks.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin

**SECURITY-1527
/
CVE-2019-16551 (CSRF), CVE-2019-16552 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gerrit-trigger`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger)**

**Description:**

Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.30.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, connecting to an HTTP URL or SSH server using attacker-specified credentials, or determine whether files with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins controller file system.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.30.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Build Failure Analyzer Plugin allow ReDoS

**SECURITY-1651
/
CVE-2019-16553 (CSRF), CVE-2019-16554 (missing permission check), CVE-2019-16555 (resource consumption)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`build-failure-analyzer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-failure-analyzer)**

**Description:**

Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.24.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method performing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to supply a computationally expensive regular expression that will hang the request handling thread.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.24.2 requires POST requests and implements a permission check for the affected form validation methods so that only authorized users are able to submit regular expressions.

Additionally, the regular expression is implemented in an interruptible way, so that unintentionally expensive regular expression processing can be interrupted.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin

**SECURITY-1593
/
CVE-2019-16564**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-aggregator-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-aggregator-view)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the information shown on the view it provides, such as stage names or job names.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs, define pipeline stages, or otherwise affect the information shown by Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin.

Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin 1.9 escapes user-controlled information on the view it provides.

### Rundeck Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1636
/
CVE-2019-16556**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

[`rundeck`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/rundeck)**

**Description:**

Rundeck Plugin 3.6.5 and earlier stores credentials as part of its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.rundeck.RundeckNotifier.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These URLs could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Rundeck Plugin 3.6.6 stores credentials in its configuration encrypted once global and/or job configurations are saved again.

### Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1598
/
CVE-2019-16557**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`redgate-sql-ci`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/redgate-sql-ci)**

**Description:**

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its build step configuration.
These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.4 stores its credentials encrypted once job configurations are saved again.

### SSL/TLS certificate validation globally and unconditionally disabled by Spira Importer Plugin

**SECURITY-1580
/

SECURITY-1681 / CVE-2019-16549 (XXE) & CVE-2019-16550 (CSRF)
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager
APIs. Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure
the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. While Jenkins
users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a
custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle
attacks, especially if it's not an HTTPS URL.

Additionally, a connection test form validation method does not require
POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow attackers to have Jenkins parse
crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets
from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service
attacks.

SECURITY-1527 / CVE-2019-16551 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16552 (missing permission check)
Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.30.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks
in methods performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
access to perform connection tests, connecting to an HTTP URL or SSH server
using attacker-specified credentials, or determine whether files with an
attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1651 / CVE-2019-16553 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16554 (missing permission check)
 & CVE-2019-16555 (resource consumption)
Build Failure Analyzer Plugin 1.24.1 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in a method performing form validation. This allows users
with Overall/Read access to supply a computationally expensive regular
expression that will hang the request handling thread.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1593 / CVE-2019-16564
Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the
information shown on the view it provides, such as stage names or job
names.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by
users able to configure jobs, define pipeline stages, or otherwise affect
the information shown by Pipeline Aggregator View Plugin.

SECURITY-1636 / CVE-2019-16556
Rundeck Plugin 3.6.5 and earlier stores credentials as part of its global
configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.rundeck.RundeckNotifier.xml` and
job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. These URLs could be viewed by
users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files)
or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1598 / CVE-2019-16557
Redgate SQL Change Automation Plugin 2.0.3 and earlier stores credentials
unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master as part of its
build step configuration. These credentials can be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1580 / CVE-2019-16558
Spira Importer Plugin 3.2.3 and earlier unconditionally disables SSL/TLS
certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1371 / CVE-2019-16559 (permission check) & CVE-2019-16560 (CSRF)
WebSphere Deployer Plugin 1.6.1 and earlier does not perform permission
checks in methods performing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, determine whether files
with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system,
and obtain limited information about the Jenkins and plugin configuration
based on the responses. The latter include the ability to set plugin
configuration options.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1581 / CVE-2019-16561
WebSphere Deployer Plugin 1.6.1 and earlier allows users with Overall/Read
access to disable SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation for the
entire Jenkins master JVM, or specify a new Java keystore from a file
stored on the Jenkins master filesystem.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1591 / CVE-2019-16562
buildgraph-view Plugin 1.8 and earlier does not escape the description of
builds shown in its view.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users able to change the build description.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1592 / CVE-2019-16563
Mission Control Plugin 0.9.16 and earlier does not escape job display names
and build names in the view it provides.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be
exploited by users able to change these properties.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1605 (1) / CVE-2019-16565 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16566 (missing permission check)
Team Concert Plugin 1.3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks on
a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1605 (2) / CVE-2019-16567
Team Concert Plugin 1.3.0 and earlier provides a list of applicable
credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to
use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1521 / CVE-2019-16568
SCTMExecutor Plugin 2.2 and earlier stores Silk Central credentials in the
global Jenkins configuration and in job `config.xml` files.

While these credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted
in plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in
exposure of these credentials through browser extensions, cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1603 / CVE-2019-16569
Mantis Plugin 0.26 and earlier does not require POST requests on a
connection test method, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. This allows
attackers to have Jenkins connect to Mantis-related paths on an
attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1604 / CVE-2019-16570 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16571 (missing permission check)
RapidDeploy Plugin 4.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check on
form validation methods. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to RapidDeploy-related paths on an attacker-specified
web server.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1597 / CVE-2019-16572
Weibo Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier stores a credential unencrypted in its
global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.weibo.WeiboNotifier.xml`
on the Jenkins master. This credential can be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1600 / CVE-2019-16573 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16574 (missing permission check)
Alauda DevOps Pipeline Plugin 2.3.2 and earlier does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to Kubernetes-related paths on an
attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials IDs
obtained through another method, capturing token credentials managed by
Alauda DevOps Pipeline Plugin.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1602 / CVE-2019-16575 (CSRF) & CVE-2019-16576 (missing permission check)
Alauda Kubernetes Suport Plugin 2.3.0 and earlier does not require POST
requests on a connection test method, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
This allows attackers to have Jenkins connect to Kubernetes-related paths
on an attacker-specified web server using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing 'Secret Text' credentials
stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, if no credentials ID is specified, the connection uses the
default Kubernetes token from
`/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
