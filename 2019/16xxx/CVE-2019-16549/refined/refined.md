      "description": "Maven Release Plug-in Plugin retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager APIs. Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if itâ€™s not an HTTPS URL.",

      "affected_versions": "0.16.1 and earlier",

      "privileges_required": "Low (Overall/Read access)",
      "user_interaction": "None",
      "impact": "Attackers can have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.",
      "root_cause": "The XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.",
      "fix": "Maven Release Plug-in Plugin 0.16.2 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks."
