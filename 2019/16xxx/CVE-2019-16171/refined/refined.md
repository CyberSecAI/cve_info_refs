The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains that lists vulnerabilities found in their products during the second quarter of 2019. It includes an entry for **YouTrack** with the description "Stored XSS on the issue page" and references **CVE-2019-16171**.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue on the YouTrack issue page. This means that malicious JavaScript can be permanently saved within the application's database, likely through user input.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). This occurs when user-supplied data is saved and later displayed without proper sanitization/encoding, allowing execution of malicious scripts in the browsers of other users.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that would execute in the browsers of other users who view the affected issue page. This could lead to a wide range of attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies/authentication tokens)
    *   Phishing (redirecting users to malicious sites)
    *   Defacement of the page
    *   Data theft or manipulation
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious JavaScript into the YouTrack issue page. This is likely done through a vulnerable input field, allowing to store the malicious script.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need an account with sufficient permissions to create or edit issues and include malicious JavaScript in a vulnerable field.

This content provides more detail than the standard CVE description by specifying the specific location of the XSS vulnerability ("issue page") and giving an overview of the potential attack vectors and impact.
