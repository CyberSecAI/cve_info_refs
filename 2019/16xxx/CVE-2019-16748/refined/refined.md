The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16748.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Missing sanity checks before accessing the certificate data in `CheckCertSignature_ex` function. Specifically, the code doesn't verify if the current `extIdx` position is within the bounds of the certificate `cert` buffer before attempting to read an ASN_BOOLEAN value using `GetBoolean` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-overread: The `GetBoolean` function reads beyond the allocated buffer for the certificate data. This occurs when the `extIdx` goes beyond the valid boundaries of the `cert` buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash: The heap-overread leads to an application crash, as demonstrated by the ASAN report.
- Potential for other vulnerabilities: While this report focuses on the crash, out-of-bounds reads can sometimes be leveraged for further exploitation, depending on the specific memory layout.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker can send a crafted certificate to the server via the network using a custom crafted message, triggering the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send data to a server using the vulnerable wolfSSL library.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious certificates with specific structures to trigger the vulnerability.
