**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Google Compute Engine Plugin did not perform SSH host key verification when connecting to VMs launched by the plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Lack of SSH host key verification.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker could intercept connections to attacker-specified build agents without warning. This could lead to the compromise of sensitive information, the execution of malicious code, or other forms of unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack on the network path between Jenkins and the Google Compute Engine VMs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the target Google Compute Engine VMs and must be able to impersonate the legitimate SSH host.
