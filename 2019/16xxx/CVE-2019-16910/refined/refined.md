{
  "CVE-2019-16910": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The deterministic ECDSA calculation reused the scheme's HMAC-DRBG to implement blinding. Because of this for the same key and message the same blinding value was generated.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The reuse of the same HMAC-DRBG output for blinding weakened the countermeasure, leaking information about the private key through side channels.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially recover the private key through side-channel analysis by observing the deterministic blinding.",
       "Attack vectors": "Side-channel attacks by measuring the power consumption, timing or other physical characteristics during the ECDSA signing process.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to perform side-channel measurements (power, timing, etc.) of the device performing ECDSA signatures."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The deterministic ECDSA signature calculation used the same HMAC-DRBG for generating the ephemeral key and the blinding value, resulting in the same blinding value for a given key and message.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The reuse of the HMAC-DRBG output for both the ephemeral key and the blinding process reduces the effectiveness of the blinding, making the system vulnerable to side channel attacks.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially recover the private key through side-channel analysis by observing multiple signing operations with the same key and message.",
      "Attack vectors": "Side-channel attacks, such as timing attacks or power analysis, on devices performing ECDSA signatures.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs physical access to the device performing ECDSA signatures or the ability to observe the signing process remotely through side-channels."
