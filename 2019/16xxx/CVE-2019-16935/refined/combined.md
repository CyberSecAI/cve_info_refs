# CVE-2019-9947

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9946.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9948.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9947 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9947)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.3. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue. This is fixed in: v2.7.17, v2.7.17rc1, v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1, v3.5.8, v3.5.8rc1, v3.5.8rc2, v3.5.9; v3.6.10, v3.6.10rc1, v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12, v3.6.9, v3.6.9rc1; v3.7.4, v3.7.4rc1, v3.7.4rc2, v3.7.5, v3.7.5rc1, v3.7.6, v3.7.6rc1, v3.7.7, v3.7.7rc1, v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9.

What do you need to do:   1. Don't panic. 2. Check [the buildbot page in the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/buildbots/) if you don't know what the buildbots are or how they work. 3. Go to the page of the buildbot that failed (<https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/120/builds/1323>) and take a look at the build logs. 4. Check if the failure is related to this commit ([39a0c75](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/39a0c7555530e31c6941a78da19b6a5b61170687)) or if it is a false positive. 5. If the failure is related to this commit, please, reflect that on the issue and make a new Pull Request with a fix.

| I'd like to optimize html.escape of master version with b41cde8 if this showing better performance. What do you think?  5 str.replace() calls sound inefficient, so there is likely room for enhancement. But I am not sure what is the best approach. If you find something which is faster, please open a separated issue. But a security fix in a super stable branch (2.7) is not the right place to experiment optimization :-) Correctness matters more here ;-) |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1149955#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-09-09 08:56:02 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16056  An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 444 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2684313.1).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 30 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2679563.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2679563.1).

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

                 CVE-2020-14422
Debian Bug     : 924072 921064 940901

Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language.

CVE-2018-20406

    Modules/_pickle.c has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT
    value that is mishandled during a "resize to twice the size"
    attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only
    relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or
    hundreds of gigabytes of data.

CVE-2018-20852

    http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in
    Lib/http/cookiejar.py does not correctly validate the domain: it
    can be tricked into sending existing cookies to the wrong
    server. An attacker may abuse this flaw by using a server with a
    hostname that has another valid hostname as a suffix (e.g.,
    pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com). When a
    program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an HTTP
    connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can
    be leaked to the attacker.

CVE-2019-5010

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the X509
    certificate parser. A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause
    a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An
    attacker can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted
    certificates to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit,
    urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted
    URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or
    authentication data and send that information to a different host
    than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP
    header or a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed
    by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the
    CVE-2019-9740 query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

    urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
    file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
    urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

    A security regression was discovered in python, which still allows
    an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
    password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
    URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind
    of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide
    specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related
    information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a
    different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been
    correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the
    application.

CVE-2019-16056

    The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain
    multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module
    and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a
    message could be tricked into accepting an email address that
    should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340;
    however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

CVE-2019-16935

    The documentation XML-RPC server has XSS via the server_title
    field. This occurs in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py. If set_server_title is
    called with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered
    to clients that visit the http URL for this server.

CVE-2019-18348

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This
    is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the
    CVE-2019-9947 path string issue

CVE-2020-8492

    Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
    urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

CVE-2020-14422

    Lib/ipaddress.py improperly computes hash values in the
    IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a
    remote attacker to cause a denial of service if an application is
    affected by the performance of a dictionary containing
    IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface objects, and this attacker can
    cause many dictionary entries to be created.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.3-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.5 packages.

For the detailed security status of python3.5 please refer to

| [@corona10](https://github.com/corona10): I backported manually your change to 3.6. I just had to fix a simple conflict on imports.  Would you mind to try to backport the change to Python 2.7 which also has the bug? |

| ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Buildbot failure ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Hi! The buildbot **PPC64LE Fedora 3.7** has failed when building commit [39a0c75](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/39a0c7555530e31c6941a78da19b6a5b61170687).  What do you need to do:   1. Don't panic. 2. Check [the buildbot page in the devguide](https://devguide.python.org/buildbots/) if you don't know what the buildbots are or how they work. 3. Go to the page of the buildbot that failed (<https://buildbot.python.org/all/#builders/120/builds/1323>) and take a look at the build logs. 4. Check if the failure is related to this commit ([39a0c75](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/39a0c7555530e31c6941a78da19b6a5b61170687)) or if it is a false positive. 5. If the failure is related to this commit, please, reflect that on the issue and make a new Pull Request with a fix.

| ``` It's "[Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py)" in python2x or "[Lib/xmlrpc/server.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/xmlrpc/server.py)" in python3x.  Steps to reproduce:  1.[Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py) is “a documenting XML-RPC Server“,In the Class ServerHTMLDoc, method markup(), will escape the Special symbols to safe(such as <," etc). 2.But it only escape the content from server.set_server_name() and server.set_server_documentation(),the "title" content from the server.set_server_title() will not be escaped, so if I set_server_title('123</title><script>alert(1)</script>'), it will cause XSS because not escaped. 3.I see the alert in Chrome by visiting <http://127.0.0.1>,the Poc is the poc.py（run in python2.7） in attachments. 4.Problems seems to be at <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/xmlrpc/server.py#L897> "return documenter.page(self.server_title,documentation)".Before this line,variable "documentation" has been escaped but self.server_title not.This is the main cause. ``` | | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1763229#c0)  kat    2019-10-18 14:24:20 UTC  ``` The documentation XML-RPC server in various Python versions has XSS via the server_title field. This occurs in Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py in Python 2.x, and in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py in Python 3.x. If set_server_title is called with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients that visit the http URL for this server.

This module can be used to create simple XML-RPC serversby creating a server and either installing functions, aclass instance, or by extending the SimpleXMLRPCServerclass.
It can also be used to handle XML-RPC requests in a CGIenvironment using CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.
The Doc\* classes can be used to create XML-RPC servers thatserve pydoc-style documentation in response to HTTPGET requests. This documentation is dynamically generatedbased on the functions and methods registered with theserver.
A list of possible usage patterns follows:
1. Install functions:
server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))server.register\_function(pow)server.register\_function(lambda x,y: x+y, 'add')server.serve\_forever()
2. Install an instance:
class MyFuncs: def \_\_init\_\_(self): # make all of the sys functions available through sys.func\_name import sys self.sys = sys def \_listMethods(self): # implement this method so that system.listMethods # knows to advertise the sys methods return list\_public\_methods(self) + \ ['sys.' + method for method in list\_public\_methods(self.sys)] def pow(self, x, y): return pow(x, y) def add(self, x, y) : return x + y
server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))server.register\_introspection\_functions()server.register\_instance(MyFuncs())server.serve\_forever()
3. Install an instance with custom dispatch method:
class Math: def \_listMethods(self): # this method must be present for system.listMethods # to work return ['add', 'pow'] def \_methodHelp(self, method): # this method must be present for system.methodHelp # to work if method == 'add': return "add(2,3) => 5" elif method == 'pow': return "pow(x, y[, z]) => number" else: # By convention, return empty # string if no help is available return "" def \_dispatch(self, method, params): if method == 'pow': return pow(\*params) elif method == 'add': return params[0] + params[1] else: raise ValueError('bad method')
server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))server.register\_introspection\_functions()server.register\_instance(Math())server.serve\_forever()
4. Subclass SimpleXMLRPCServer:
class MathServer(SimpleXMLRPCServer): def \_dispatch(self, method, params): try: # We are forcing the 'export\_' prefix on methods that are # callable through XML-RPC to prevent potential security # problems func = getattr(self, 'export\_' + method) except AttributeError: raise Exception('method "%s" is not supported' % method) else: return func(\*params)
 def export\_add(self, x, y): return x + y
server = MathServer(("localhost", 8000))server.serve\_forever()

They do not return any error value or raise any exception, thus making it impossible for the users of those functions to know if something was wrong.  When an application uses the `email` python module to parse an email address, the wrong output of the vulnerable functions may be used to trick the application to use wrong values and impact the Confidentiality, Integrity and/or Availability of a system.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-09-10 08:58:21 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1749839#c6): > BTW python37 is also packaged in Fedora.

I have create a tracker for fedora-rawhide/python37.

Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.13-2+deb9u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16935 CVE-2021-23336

Two security issues have been discovered in python2.7:

CVE-2019-16935

    The documentation XML-RPC server in Python 2.7 has XSS via the server_title
    field. This occurs in Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py in Python 2.x, and in
    Lib/xmlrpc/server.py in Python 3.x. If set_server_title is called with
    untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients that
    visit the http URL for this server.

CVE-2021-23336

    The Python2.7 vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl
    and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When
    the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
    cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy
    (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious
    requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not
    see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache
    key of an unkeyed parameter.

    **Attention, API-change!**
    Please be sure your software is working properly if it uses `urllib.parse.parse_qs`
    or `urllib.parse.parse_qsl`, `cgi.parse` or `cgi.parse_multipart`.

    Earlier Python versions allowed using both  ``;`` and ``&`` as query parameter
    separators in `urllib.parse.parse_qs` and `urllib.parse.parse_qsl`.
    Due to security concerns, and to conform with
    newer W3C recommendations, this has been changed to allow only a single
    separator key, with ``&`` as the default.  This change also affects
    `cgi.parse` and `cgi.parse_multipart` as they use the affected
    functions internally. For more details, please see their respective
    documentation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.13-2+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9636 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9636)

#### Description

Python 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2 is affected by: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly. This is fixed in: v2.7.17, v2.7.17rc1, v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1, v3.5.7, v3.5.8, v3.5.8rc1, v3.5.8rc2, v3.5.9; v3.6.10, v3.6.10rc1, v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12, v3.6.9, v3.6.9rc1; v3.7.3, v3.7.3rc1, v3.7.4, v3.7.4rc1, v3.7.4rc2, v3.7.5, v3.7.5rc1, v3.7.6, v3.7.6rc1, v3.7.7, v3.7.7rc1, v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9.

# USN-4151-2: Python vulnerabilities

10 October 2019

Several security issues were fixed in Python.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [python2.7](/security/cves?package=python2.7) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language
* [python3.4](/security/cves?package=python3.4) - An interactive high-level object-oriented language

## Details

USN-4151-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in Python. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Python incorrectly parsed certain email addresses. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to trick Python applications

into accepting email addresses that should be denied. ([CVE-2019-16056](/security/CVE-2019-16056))

It was discovered that the Python documentation XML-RPC server incorrectly

handled certain fields. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. ([CVE-2019-16935](/security/CVE-2019-16935))

### Reduce your security exposure

# CVE-2019-16056

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-15961.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-16058.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-16056 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16056)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1727276#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-07-05 10:22:43 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in urllib/urllib2 in Python. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls the host part of the url parameter passed to urlopen().  The fix for [CVE-2019-9947](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9947) is ineffective if the glibc version used by python is still affected by [CVE-2016-10739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-10739). The original fix for [CVE-2019-9947](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9947) only checked the part of the URL after the port (e.g. in "<http://server:7777/my/path?query>" only "/my/path?query" was checked for invalid characters) so if an attacker can control the hostname part he is still able to inject HTTP headers. Due to [CVE-2016-10739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-10739), getaddrinfo() resolves an invalid hostname as a valid one, so the URL can contain CLRF sequences and, at the same time, it can be resolved to a valid host.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1130840#c0)  Karol Babioch   2019-03-28 13:25:58 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.2. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the query string or PATH_INFO) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to CVE-2019-9740.

*Release date: 2018-01-23*

### Security[Â¶](#id10 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32551](https://bugs.python.org/issue32551): The `sys.path[0]` initialization change for [bpo-29139](https://bugs.python.org/issue29139) caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing `__main__` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. This is considered a potential security issue, as it may lead to
  privileged processes unexpectedly loading code from user controlled
  directories in situations where that was not previously the case.

  The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import locationâs
  parent directory to `sys.path`, and ensures no other `sys.path`
  entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import location
  named on the command line. (Originally reported as [bpo-29723](https://bugs.python.org/issue29723) against
  Python 3.6rc1, but it was missed at the time that the then upcoming Python
  3.5.4 release would also be affected)
* [bpo-30657](https://bugs.python.org/issue30657): Fixed possible integer overflow in PyBytes\_DecodeEscape,
  CVE-2017-1000158. Original patch by Jay Bosamiya; rebased to Python 3 by
  Miro HronÄok.

  get security fixes.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#core-and-builtins "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31095](https://bugs.python.org/issue31095): Fix potential crash during GC caused by `tp_dealloc` which
  doesnât call `PyObject_GC_UnTrack()`.

### Library[Â¶](#id11 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32072](https://bugs.python.org/issue32072): Fixed issues with binary plists:
  + Fixed saving bytearrays.
  + Identical objects will be saved only once.
  + Equal references will be load as identical objects.
  + Added support for saving and loading recursive data structures.
* [bpo-31170](https://bugs.python.org/issue31170): expat: Update libexpat from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4. Fix copying of
  partial characters for UTF-8 input (libexpat bug 115):
  <https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/115>

## Python 3.5.4 final[Â¶](#python-3-5-4-final "Permalink to this headline")

  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0âs fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os- specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesnât
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using `XML_SetHashSalt()`.
* [bpo-30500](https://bugs.python.org/issue30500): Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, `splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')` now correctly returns the

  PyThread\_acquire\_lock() is asked not to block.
* [bpo-27945](https://bugs.python.org/issue27945): Fixed various segfaults with dict when input collections are
  mutated during searching, inserting or comparing. Based on patches by
  Duane Griffin and Tim Mitchell.
* [bpo-25794](https://bugs.python.org/issue25794): Fixed type.\_\_setattr\_\_() and type.\_\_delattr\_\_() for
  non-interned attribute names. Based on patch by Eryk Sun.

  weakref objects.
* [bpo-29438](https://bugs.python.org/issue29438): Fixed use-after-free problem in key sharing dict.
* [bpo-29319](https://bugs.python.org/issue29319): Prevent RunMainFromImporter overwriting sys.path[0].
* [bpo-29337](https://bugs.python.org/issue29337): Fixed possible BytesWarning when compare the code objects.
  Warnings could be emitted at compile time.
* [bpo-29478](https://bugs.python.org/issue29478): If max\_line\_length=None is specified while using the Compat32

  option. Patch by Nir Soffer.
* [bpo-30807](https://bugs.python.org/issue30807): signal.setitimer() may disable the timer when passed a tiny
  value.

  Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(),
  which is specified as taking microsecond-resolution intervals. However, on
  some platform, our conversion routine could convert 1e-6 into a zero
  interval, therefore disabling the timer instead of (re-)scheduling it.

  with a null byte.
* [bpo-25462](https://bugs.python.org/issue25462): The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most
  operations in C implementation of OrderedDict.

  use the same rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) ==
  datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t). It also the rounding mode used by
  round(float) for example.

  directly instead of calling the encode() method of the string.

  of stdin (0), stdout (1) or stderr (2) is closed while Python is creating

* [bpo-15348](https://bugs.python.org/issue15348): Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.
* [bpo-24455](https://bugs.python.org/issue24455): Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.
* Change âThe programâ to âYour programâ in an IDLE âkill program?â message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running

  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue24820): IDLE now has an âIDLE Darkâ built-in text color theme. It is
  more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, â¦ are still green, red, orange, â¦ . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the âSave as New
  Custom Themeâ button and enter a new name, such as âCustom Darkâ. The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.
* [bpo-25224](https://bugs.python.org/issue25224): README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  âIDLEâ now means âIntegrated Development and Learning Environmentâ.

  Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman). \* Give code
  snippet a very Sphinx- like light blueish-gray background. \* Re-use
  initial width and height set by users for shell and editor. \* When the
  Table of Contents (TOC) menu is used, put the section header at the top of

* [bpo-25199](https://bugs.python.org/issue25199): Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.
* [bpo-16893](https://bugs.python.org/issue16893): Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new
  idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks
  better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The
  tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Mark Roseman.
  The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are
  deprecated.
* [bpo-24199](https://bugs.python.org/issue24199): Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.

  if Argument Clinic processes the same symbol multiple times, and itâs
  emitted at the end of all processing rather than immediately after the
  first use.

  instead relying on OpenSSL source being configured and ready to build.
  The `PCbuild\build_ssl.py` script has been re-written and re-named to
  `PCbuild\prepare_ssl.py`, and takes care of configuring OpenSSL source
  for both 32 and 64 bit platforms. OpenSSL sources obtained from

  ncursesw directory.
* [bpo-15234](https://bugs.python.org/issue15234): For BerkelyDB and Sqlite, only add the found library and

  All functions now raise BufferError in that case.
* [bpo-22445](https://bugs.python.org/issue22445): PyBuffer\_IsContiguous() now implements precise contiguity
  tests, compatible with NumPyâs NPY\_RELAXED\_STRIDES\_CHECKING compilation

  these functions.
* [bpo-21233](https://bugs.python.org/issue21233): Add new C functions: PyMem\_RawCalloc(), PyMem\_Calloc(),
  PyObject\_Calloc(), \_PyObject\_GC\_Calloc(). bytes(int) is now using
  `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` for large objects which is faster and
  use less memory.
* [bpo-20942](https://bugs.python.org/issue20942): PyImport\_ImportFrozenModuleObject() no longer sets \_\_file\_\_ to
  match what importlib does; this affects \_frozen\_importlib as well as any
  module loaded using imp.init\_frozen().

* [bpo-20710](https://bugs.python.org/issue20710): The pydoc summary line no longer displays the âselfâ parameter
  for bound methods.
* [bpo-20566](https://bugs.python.org/issue20566): Change asyncio.as\_completed() to use a Queue, to avoid O(N\*\*2)
  behavior.
* [bpo-20704](https://bugs.python.org/issue20704): Implement new debug API in asyncio. Add new methods
  BaseEventLoop.set\_debug() and BaseEventLoop.get\_debug(). Add support for
  setting âasyncio.tasks.\_DEBUGâ variable with âPYTHONASYNCIODEBUGâ

* asyncio: Refactoring and fixes: BaseEventLoop.sock\_connect() raises an
  error if the address is not resolved; use \_\_slots\_\_ in Handle and
  TimerHandle; as\_completed() and wait() raise TypeError if the passed list
  of Futures is a single Future; call\_soon() and other âcall\_\*()â functions
  raise TypeError if the passed callback is a coroutine function;
  \_ProactorBasePipeTransport uses \_FlowControlMixin;
  WriteTransport.set\_write\_buffer\_size() calls \_maybe\_pause\_protocol() to
  consider pausing receiving if the watermark limits have changed; fix

*Release date: 2014-02-10*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id122 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-19255](https://bugs.python.org/issue19255): The builtins module is restored to initial value before
  cleaning other modules. The sys and builtins modules are cleaned last.
* [bpo-20588](https://bugs.python.org/issue20588): Make Python-ast.c C89 compliant.
* [bpo-20437](https://bugs.python.org/issue20437): Fixed 22 potential bugs when deleting object references.
* [bpo-20500](https://bugs.python.org/issue20500): Displaying an exception at interpreter shutdown no longer risks
  triggering an assertion failure in PyObject\_Str.
* [bpo-20538](https://bugs.python.org/issue20538): UTF-7 incremental decoder produced inconsistent string when
  input was truncated in BASE64 section.
* [bpo-20404](https://bugs.python.org/issue20404): io.TextIOWrapper (and hence the open() builtin) now uses the
  internal codec marking system added for [bpo-19619](https://bugs.python.org/issue19619) to throw LookupError
  for known non- text encodings at stream construction time. The existing
  output type checks remain in place to deal with unmarked third party
  codecs.
* [bpo-17162](https://bugs.python.org/issue17162): Add PyType\_GetSlot.
* [bpo-20162](https://bugs.python.org/issue20162): Fix an alignment issue in the siphash24() hash function which
  caused a crash on PowerPC 64-bit (ppc64).

### Library[Â¶](#id123 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20530](https://bugs.python.org/issue20530): The signatures for slot builtins have been updated to reflect
  the fact that they only accept positional-only arguments.
* [bpo-20517](https://bugs.python.org/issue20517): Functions in the os module that accept two filenames now
  register both filenames in the exception on failure.
* [bpo-20563](https://bugs.python.org/issue20563): The ipaddress module API is now considered stable.
* [bpo-14983](https://bugs.python.org/issue14983): email.generator now always adds a line end after each MIME
  boundary marker, instead of doing so only when there is an epilogue. This
  fixes an RFC compliance bug and solves an issue with signed MIME parts.
* [bpo-20540](https://bugs.python.org/issue20540): Fix a performance regression (vs. Python 3.2) when layering a
  multiprocessing Connection over a TCP socket. For small payloads, Nagleâs
  algorithm would introduce idle delays before the entire transmission of a
  message.
* [bpo-16983](https://bugs.python.org/issue16983): the new email header parsing code will now decode encoded words
  that are (incorrectly) surrounded by quotes, and register a defect.
* [bpo-19772](https://bugs.python.org/issue19772): email.generator no longer mutates the message object when doing
  a down- transform from 8bit to 7bit CTEs.
* [bpo-20536](https://bugs.python.org/issue20536): the statistics module now correctly handle Decimal instances
  with positive exponents
* [bpo-18805](https://bugs.python.org/issue18805): the netmask/hostmask parsing in ipaddress now more reliably
  filters out illegal values and correctly allows any valid prefix length.
* [bpo-20481](https://bugs.python.org/issue20481): For at least Python 3.4, the statistics module will require
  that all inputs for a single operation be of a single consistent type, or
  else a mixed of ints and a single other consistent type. This avoids some
  interoperability issues that arose with the previous approach of coercing
  to a suitable common type.
* [bpo-20478](https://bugs.python.org/issue20478): the statistics module now treats collections.Counter inputs
  like any other iterable.
* [bpo-17369](https://bugs.python.org/issue17369): get\_filename was raising an exception if the filename
  parameterâs RFC2231 encoding was broken in certain ways. This was a
  regression relative to python2.
* [bpo-20013](https://bugs.python.org/issue20013): Some imap servers disconnect if the current mailbox is deleted,
  and imaplib did not handle that case gracefully. Now it handles the âbyeâ
  correctly.
* [bpo-20531](https://bugs.python.org/issue20531): Revert 3.4 version of fix for #19063, and apply the 3.3
  version. That is, do *not* raise an error if unicode is passed to
  email.message.Message.set\_payload.
* [bpo-20476](https://bugs.python.org/issue20476): If a non-compat32 policy is used with any of the email parsers,
  EmailMessage is now used as the factory class. The factory class should
  really come from the policy; that will get fixed in 3.5.
* [bpo-19920](https://bugs.python.org/issue19920): TarFile.list() no longer fails when outputs a listing
  containing non- encodable characters. Based on patch by Vajrasky Kok.
* [bpo-20515](https://bugs.python.org/issue20515): Fix NULL pointer dereference introduced by [bpo-20368](https://bugs.python.org/issue20368).
* [bpo-19186](https://bugs.python.org/issue19186): Restore namespacing of expat symbols inside the pyexpat module.
* [bpo-20053](https://bugs.python.org/issue20053): ensurepip (and hence venv) are no longer affected by the
  settings in the default pip configuration file.
* [bpo-20426](https://bugs.python.org/issue20426): When passing the re.DEBUG flag, re.compile() displays the debug
  output every time it is called, regardless of the compilation cache.
* [bpo-20368](https://bugs.python.org/issue20368): The null character now correctly passed from Tcl to Python.
  Improved error handling in variables-related commands.
* [bpo-20435](https://bugs.python.org/issue20435): Fix \_pyio.StringIO.getvalue() to take into account newline
  translation settings.
* tracemalloc: Fix slicing traces and fix slicing a traceback.
* [bpo-20354](https://bugs.python.org/issue20354): Fix an alignment issue in the tracemalloc module on 64-bit
  platforms. Bug seen on 64-bit Linux when using âmake profile-optâ.
* [bpo-17159](https://bugs.python.org/issue17159): inspect.signature now accepts duck types of functions, which
  adds support for Cython functions. Initial patch by Stefan Behnel.
* [bpo-18801](https://bugs.python.org/issue18801): Fix inspect.classify\_class\_attrs to correctly classify
  object.\_\_new\_\_ and object.\_\_init\_\_.
* Fixed cmath.isinfâs name in its argument parsing code.
* [bpo-20311](https://bugs.python.org/issue20311): poll and epoll now round the timeout away from zero, instead of
  rounding towards zero, in select and selectors modules:
  select.epoll.poll(), selectors.PollSelector.poll() and
  selectors.EpollSelector.poll(). For example, a timeout of one microsecond
  (1e-6) is now rounded to one millisecondi (1e-3), instead of being rounded
  to zero. However, the granularity property and asyncioâs resolution
  feature were removed again. (See also: [bpo-20452](https://bugs.python.org/issue20452))
* asyncio: Some refactoring; various fixes; add write flow control to unix
  pipes; Future.set\_exception() instantiates the exception argument if it is
  a class; improved proactor pipe transport; support wait\_for(f, None);
  donât log broken/disconnected pipes; use ValueError instead of assert for
  forbidden subprocess\_{shell,exec} arguments; added a convenience API for
  subprocess management; added StreamReader.at\_eof(); properly handle
  duplicate coroutines/futures in gather(), wait(), as\_completed(); use a
  bytearray for buffering in StreamReader; and more.
* [bpo-20288](https://bugs.python.org/issue20288): fix handling of invalid numeric charrefs in HTMLParser.
* [bpo-20424](https://bugs.python.org/issue20424): Python implementation of io.StringIO now supports lone
  surrogates.
* [bpo-20308](https://bugs.python.org/issue20308): inspect.signature now works on classes without user-defined
  \_\_init\_\_ or \_\_new\_\_ methods.
* [bpo-20372](https://bugs.python.org/issue20372): inspect.getfile (and a bunch of other inspect functions that
  use it) doesnât crash with unexpected AttributeError on classes defined in
  C without \_\_module\_\_.
* [bpo-20356](https://bugs.python.org/issue20356): inspect.signature formatting uses â/â to separate
  positional-only parameters from others.
* [bpo-20223](https://bugs.python.org/issue20223): inspect.signature now supports methods defined with
  functools.partialmethods.
* [bpo-19456](https://bugs.python.org/issue19456): ntpath.join() now joins relative paths correctly when a drive
  is present.
* [bpo-19077](https://bugs.python.org/issue19077): tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup no longer fails when called
  during shutdown. Emitting resource warning in \_\_del\_\_ no longer fails.
  Original patch by Antoine Pitrou.
* [bpo-20394](https://bugs.python.org/issue20394): Silence Coverity warning in audioop module.
* [bpo-20367](https://bugs.python.org/issue20367): Fix behavior of concurrent.futures.as\_completed() for duplicate
  arguments. Patch by Glenn Langford.

  codecs.StreamReader returned incomplete data when were called after
  readline() or read(size). Based on patch by Amaury Forgeot dâArc.
* [bpo-20105](https://bugs.python.org/issue20105): the codec exception chaining now correctly sets the traceback
  of the original exception as its \_\_traceback\_\_ attribute.
* [bpo-17481](https://bugs.python.org/issue17481): inspect.getfullargspec() now uses inspect.signature() API.
* [bpo-15304](https://bugs.python.org/issue15304): concurrent.futures.wait() can block forever even if Futures
  have completed. Patch by Glenn Langford.
* [bpo-14455](https://bugs.python.org/issue14455): plistlib: fix serializing integers in the range of an unsigned
  long long but outside of the range of signed long long for binary plist
  files.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id124 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20406](https://bugs.python.org/issue20406): Use Python application icons for Idle window title bars. Patch
  mostly by Serhiy Storchaka.
* Update the python.gif icon for the Idle classbrowser and pathbowser from
  the old green snake to the new blue and yellow snakes.
* [bpo-17721](https://bugs.python.org/issue17721): Remove non-functional configuration dialog help button until we
  make it actually gives some help when clicked. Patch by Guilherme SimÃµes.

### Tests[Â¶](#id125 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20532](https://bugs.python.org/issue20532): Tests which use \_testcapi now are marked as CPython only.
* [bpo-19920](https://bugs.python.org/issue19920): Added tests for TarFile.list(). Based on patch by Vajrasky

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id126 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20530](https://bugs.python.org/issue20530): Argument Clinicâs signature format has been revised again. The
  new syntax is highly human readable while still preventing false
  positives. The syntax also extends Python syntax to denote âselfâ and
  positional-only parameters, allowing inspect.Signature objects to be
  totally accurate for all supported builtins in Python 3.4.
* [bpo-20456](https://bugs.python.org/issue20456): Argument Clinic now observes the C preprocessor conditional
  compilation statements of the C files it parses. When a Clinic block is
  inside a conditional code, it adjusts its output to match, including
  automatically generating an empty methoddef macro.
* [bpo-20456](https://bugs.python.org/issue20456): Cloned functions in Argument Clinic now use the correct name,
  not the name of the function they were cloned from, for text strings
  inside generated code.

  parameter in Python and C, using âasâ on the parameter line.
* [bpo-20326](https://bugs.python.org/issue20326): Argument Clinic now uses a simple, unique signature to annotate
  text signatures in docstrings, resulting in fewer false positives. âselfâ
  parameters are also explicitly marked, allowing inspect.Signature() to
  authoritatively detect (and skip) said parameters.
* [bpo-20326](https://bugs.python.org/issue20326): Argument Clinic now generates separate checksums for the input
  and output sections of the block, allowing external tools to verify that
  the input has not changed (and thus the output is not out-of-date).

### Build[Â¶](#id127 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20465](https://bugs.python.org/issue20465): Update SQLite shipped with OS X installer to 3.8.3.

### C API[Â¶](#id128 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20517](https://bugs.python.org/issue20517): Added new functions allowing OSError exceptions to reference
  two filenames instead of one: PyErr\_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObjects() and
  PyErr\_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilenameObjects().

  added to sys.path.

## Python 3.4.0 beta 3[Â¶](#python-3-4-0-beta-3 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2014-01-26*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id130 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20189](https://bugs.python.org/issue20189): Four additional builtin types (PyTypeObject,
  PyMethodDescr\_Type, \_PyMethodWrapper\_Type, and PyWrapperDescr\_Type) have
  been modified to provide introspection information for builtins.
* [bpo-17825](https://bugs.python.org/issue17825): Cursor â^â is correctly positioned for SyntaxError and
  IndentationError.
* [bpo-2382](https://bugs.python.org/issue2382): SyntaxError cursor â^â is now written at correct position in
  most cases when multibyte characters are in line (before â^â). This still
  not works correctly with wide East Asian characters.
* [bpo-18960](https://bugs.python.org/issue18960): The first line of Python script could be executed twice when
  the source encoding was specified on the second line. Now the source
  encoding declaration on the second line isnât effective if the first line
  contains anything except a comment. âpython -xâ works now again with
  files with the source encoding declarations, and can be used to make
  Python batch files on Windows.

### Library[Â¶](#id131 "Permalink to this headline")

* asyncio: Various improvements and small changes not all covered by issues
  listed below. E.g. wait\_for() now cancels the inner task if the timeout
  occcurs; tweaked the set of exported symbols; renamed Empty/Full to
  QueueEmpty/QueueFull; âwith (yield from lock)â now uses a separate context
  manager; readexactly() raises if not enough data was read; PTY support
  tweaks.
* [bpo-20311](https://bugs.python.org/issue20311): asyncio: Add a granularity attribute to BaseEventLoop: maximum
  between the resolution of the BaseEventLoop.time() method and the
  resolution of the selector. The granuarility is used in the scheduler to
  round time and deadline.

* [bpo-20189](https://bugs.python.org/issue20189): unittest.mock now no longer assumes that any object for which
  it could get an inspect.Signature is a callable written in Python. Fix
  courtesy of Michael Foord.
* [bpo-20317](https://bugs.python.org/issue20317): ExitStack.\_\_exit\_\_ could create a self-referential loop if an
  exception raised by a cleanup operation already had its context set
  correctly (for example, by the @contextmanager decorator). The infinite
  loop this caused is now avoided by checking if the expected context is
  already set before trying to fix it.

* [bpo-20206](https://bugs.python.org/issue20206): Fix edge case in email.quoprimime.encode where it truncated
  lines ending in a character needing encoding but no newline by using a
  more efficient algorithm that doesnât have the bug. (See also: [bpo-5803](https://bugs.python.org/issue5803))
* [bpo-19082](https://bugs.python.org/issue19082): Working xmlrpc.server and xmlrpc.client examples. Both in

  Gershuni.
* [bpo-20207](https://bugs.python.org/issue20207): Always disable SSLv2 except when PROTOCOL\_SSLv2 is explicitly
  asked for.
* [bpo-18960](https://bugs.python.org/issue18960): The tokenize module now ignore the source encoding declaration
  on the second line if the first line contains anything except a comment.

* [bpo-20390](https://bugs.python.org/issue20390): Argument Clinic now fails if you have required parameters after
  optional parameters.
* [bpo-20390](https://bugs.python.org/issue20390): Argument Clinic converters now have a new template they can

  encoding declaration on the second line if the first line contains
  anything except a comment.
* [bpo-19723](https://bugs.python.org/issue19723): The marker comments Argument Clinic uses have been changed to
  improve readability.
* [bpo-20157](https://bugs.python.org/issue20157): When Argument Clinic renames a parameter because its name
  collides with a C keyword, it no longer exposes that rename to

## Python 3.4.0 beta 2[Â¶](#python-3-4-0-beta-2 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2014-01-05*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id136 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-17432](https://bugs.python.org/issue17432): Drop UCS2 from names of Unicode functions in python3.def.
* [bpo-19526](https://bugs.python.org/issue19526): Exclude all new API from the stable ABI. Exceptions can be made
  if a need is demonstrated.
* [bpo-19969](https://bugs.python.org/issue19969): PyBytes\_FromFormatV() now raises an OverflowError if â%câ
  argument is not in range [0; 255].

  non-integer input; reworded docs to clarify that an integer type should
  define both \_\_int\_\_ and \_\_index\_\_.
* [bpo-19787](https://bugs.python.org/issue19787): PyThread\_set\_key\_value() now always set the value. In Python
  3.3, the function did nothing if the key already exists (if the current
  value is a non-NULL pointer).
* [bpo-14432](https://bugs.python.org/issue14432): Remove the thread state field from the frame structure. Fix a
  crash when a generator is created in a C thread that is destroyed while
  the generator is still used. The issue was that a generator contains a
  frame, and the frame kept a reference to the Python state of the destroyed
  C thread. The crash occurs when a trace function is setup.
* [bpo-19576](https://bugs.python.org/issue19576): PyGILState\_Ensure() now initializes threads. At startup, Python
  has no concrete GIL. If PyGILState\_Ensure() is called from a new thread

  needs to be created.
* [bpo-17576](https://bugs.python.org/issue17576): Deprecation warning emitted now when \_\_int\_\_() or \_\_index\_\_()
  return not int instance.

  methods.
* [bpo-19744](https://bugs.python.org/issue19744): ensurepip now provides a better error message when Python is
  built without SSL/TLS support (pip currently requires that support to run,
  even if only operating with local wheel files)
* [bpo-19734](https://bugs.python.org/issue19734): ensurepip now ignores all pip environment variables to avoid
  odd behaviour based on user configuration settings
* Fix TypeError on âsetup.py upload âshow-responseâ.

  shutdown.
* [bpo-19967](https://bugs.python.org/issue19967): Thanks to the PEP 442, asyncio.Future now uses a destructor to
  log uncaught exceptions, instead of the dedicated \_TracebackLogger class.
* Added a Task.current\_task() class method to asyncio.
* [bpo-19850](https://bugs.python.org/issue19850): Set SA\_RESTART in asyncio when registering a signal handler to
  limit EINTR occurrences.
* Implemented write flow control in asyncio for proactor event loop
  (Windows).
* Change write buffer in asyncio use to avoid O(N\*\*2) behavior. Make
  write()/sendto() accept bytearray/memoryview.
* [bpo-20034](https://bugs.python.org/issue20034): Updated alias mapping to most recent locale.alias file from
  X.org distribution using makelocalealias.py.

  locale encodings with hyphens.
* [bpo-20026](https://bugs.python.org/issue20026): Fix the sqlite module to handle correctly invalid isolation
  level (wrong type).

  Original patch by Simon Sapin.
* [bpo-19946](https://bugs.python.org/issue19946): multiprocessing now uses runpy to initialize \_\_main\_\_ in child
  processes when necessary, allowing it to correctly handle scripts without
  suffixes and submodules that use explicit relative imports or otherwise
  rely on parent modules being correctly imported prior to execution.
* [bpo-19921](https://bugs.python.org/issue19921): When Path.mkdir() is called with parents=True, any missing
  parent is created with the default permissions, ignoring the mode argument
  (mimicking the POSIX âmkdir -pâ command).
* [bpo-19887](https://bugs.python.org/issue19887): Improve the Path.resolve() algorithm to support certain symlink
  chains.
* [bpo-19912](https://bugs.python.org/issue19912): Fixed numerous bugs in ntpath.splitunc().

  respects the -f and -q flags instead of ignoring them.
* [bpo-19623](https://bugs.python.org/issue19623): Fixed writing to unseekable files in the aifc module.
* [bpo-19946](https://bugs.python.org/issue19946): multiprocessing.spawn now raises ImportError when the module to
  be used as the main module cannot be imported.

  Fixed integer overflow in the eventmask parameter.
* [bpo-19063](https://bugs.python.org/issue19063): if a Charsetâs body\_encoding was set to None, the email package
  would generate a message claiming the Content-Transfer-Encoding was 7bit,
  and produce garbage output for the content. This now works. A couple of
  other set\_payload mishandlings of non-ASCII are also fixed. In addition,
  calling set\_payload with a string argument without specifying a charset
  now raises an error (this is a new error in 3.4).
* [bpo-15475](https://bugs.python.org/issue15475): Add \_\_sizeof\_\_ implementations for itertools objects.
* [bpo-19944](https://bugs.python.org/issue19944): Fix importlib.find\_spec() so it imports parents as needed and

  name. Patch written by Toshio Kuratomi.
* [bpo-19343](https://bugs.python.org/issue19343): Expose FreeBSD-specific APIs in resource module. Original
  patch by Koobs.
* [bpo-19929](https://bugs.python.org/issue19929): Call os.read with 32768 within subprocess.Popen.communicate
  rather than 4096 for efficiency. A microbenchmark shows Linux and OS X
  both using ~50% less cpu time this way.
* [bpo-19506](https://bugs.python.org/issue19506): Use a memoryview to avoid a data copy when piping data to stdin
  within subprocess.Popen.communicate. 5-10% less cpu usage.

  large bytes string (i.e., with size greater than 2\*\*32-1).
* [bpo-19138](https://bugs.python.org/issue19138): doctestâs IGNORE\_EXCEPTION\_DETAIL now allows a match when no
  exception detail exists (no colon following the exceptionâs name, or a
  colon does follow but no text follows the colon).
* [bpo-19927](https://bugs.python.org/issue19927): Add \_\_eq\_\_ to path-based loaders in importlib.
* [bpo-19827](https://bugs.python.org/issue19827): On UNIX, setblocking() and settimeout() methods of

* Use the repr of a module name in more places in import, especially
  exceptions.
* [bpo-19619](https://bugs.python.org/issue19619): str.encode, bytes.decode and bytearray.decode now use an
  internal API to throw LookupError for known non-text encodings, rather
  than attempting the encoding or decoding operation and then throwing a
  TypeError for an unexpected output type. (The latter mechanism remains in
  place for third party non-text encodings)
* [bpo-19183](https://bugs.python.org/issue19183): Implement PEP 456 âsecure and interchangeable hash algorithmâ.
  Python now uses SipHash24 on all major platforms.

  when the creation of the replacement exception wonât lose any information.
* [bpo-19466](https://bugs.python.org/issue19466): Clear the frames of daemon threads earlier during the Python
  shutdown to call object destructors. So âunclosed fileâ resource warnings

  correctly updates current file position. Au\_read.getnframes() now returns
  an integer (as in Python 2). Au\_read and Au\_write now correctly works with

  programs that may be accessing the maildir directory.
* [bpo-14984](https://bugs.python.org/issue14984): On POSIX systems, when netrc is called without a filename
  argument (and therefore is reading the userâs $HOME/.netrc file), it now
  enforces the same security rules as typical ftp clients: the .netrc file
  must be owned by the user that owns the process and must not be readable
  by any other user.

  by Evgeny Sologubov.
* The [`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONFAULTHANDLER) environment variable now only enables the
  faulthandler module if the variable is non-empty. Same behaviour than
  other variables like [`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE).

This occurs in Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py in Python 2.x, and in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py in Python 3.x. If set_server_title is called with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients that visit the http URL for this server.

## Details

It was discovered that Python incorrectly parsed certain email addresses. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to trick Python applications

into accepting email addresses that should be denied. ([CVE-2019-16056](/security/CVE-2019-16056))

It was discovered that the Python documentation XML-RPC server incorrectly

handled certain fields. A remote attacker could use this issue to execute a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. ([CVE-2019-16935](/security/CVE-2019-16935))

# Python 3.5.8

**Release Date:** Oct. 29, 2019

# Python 3.5.8

**Python 3.5 has reached end-of-life. Python 3.5.10, the final release of the 3.5 series, is available** [here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3510/)

Python 3.5.8 was released on October 29th, 2019.

Python 3.5 has now entered "security fixes only" mode, and as such the only changes since Python 3.5.4 are security fixes. Also, Python 3.5.8 has only been released in source code form; no more official binary installers will be produced.

## Major new features of the 3.5 series, compared to 3.4

Among the new major new features and changes in the 3.5 release series are

* [PEP 441](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441), improved Python zip application support
* [PEP 448](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448), additional unpacking generalizations
* [PEP 461](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0461), "%-formatting" for bytes and bytearray objects
* [PEP 465](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465), a new operator (@) for matrix multiplication
* [PEP 471](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0471), os.scandir(), a fast new directory traversal function
* [PEP 475](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475), adding support for automatic retries of interrupted system calls
* [PEP 479](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0479), change StopIteration handling inside generators
* [PEP 484](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484), the typing module, a new standard for type annotations
* [PEP 485](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0485), math.isclose(), a function for testing approximate equality
* [PEP 486](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0486), making the Windows Python launcher aware of virtual environments
* [PEP 488](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0488), eliminating .pyo files
* [PEP 489](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0489), a new and improved mechanism for loading extension modules
* [PEP 492](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492), coroutines with async and await syntax

# Notes on this release

* The binaries for AMD64 will also work on processors that implement the Intel 64 architecture. (Also known as the "x64" architecture, and formerly known as both "EM64T" and "x86-64".) They will not work on Intel Itanium Processors (formerly "IA-64").
* Windows users: If installing Python 3.5.1 as a non-privileged user, you may need to escalate to administrator privileges to install an update to your C runtime libraries.
* Windows users: There are now "web-based" installers for Windows platforms; the installer will download the needed software components at installation time.
* Windows users: There are redistributable zip files containing the Windows builds, making it easy to redistribute Python as part of another software package. Please see the documentation regarding [Embedded Distribution](https://docs.python.org/3.5/using/windows.html#embedded-distribution) for more information.
* Windows users: Some virus scanners (most notably "Microsoft Security Essentials") are flagging "Lib/distutils/command/wininst-14.0.exe" as malware. This is a "false positive": the file does not contain any malware. We build it ourselves, from source, on a known-clean system. We've asked that this false positive report be removed, and expect action soon. In the meantime, please don't be alarmed to see this warning when installing Python 3.5.2, or when scanning any earlier version of 3.5.
* OS X users: The OS X installers are now distributed as signed installer package files compatible with the OS X Gatekeeper security feature.
* OS X users: There is [important information about IDLE, Tkinter, and Tcl/Tk on Mac OS X here](/download/mac/tcltk).
