- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Password-based encryption (PBE) algorithm used in Brocade SANnav versions before v2.0 has a weakness in generating cryptographic keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to decrypt passwords used with several services (Radius, TACAS, etc.).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is related to the cryptographic key generation process used by the PBE algorithm within the Brocade SANnav software. The specific attack vector would involve exploiting the weakness in the key generation to compromise password encryption.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have access to encrypted passwords and the ability to exploit the weak key generation algorithm.
