Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-16758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Lexmark Services Monitor (LSM) software has a directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling file paths, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** By exploiting the directory traversal, an attacker can force the application to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive files on the server where the vulnerable software is running. This could include system configuration files, password files, or other confidential information.
*   The provided proof of concept shows how the attacker can read various Windows system files such as `PerfStringBackup.ini`, `slmgr.ini` and `services`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable service running on TCP port 2070. The malicious request contains "../" sequences to traverse directories.
*   The service's responses reveal the content of the files requested by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service (port 2070) on the target machine.
*   The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the target system.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable software is Lexmark Services Monitor version 2.27.4.0.39.
*   The vendor has stated that this software is EOL (End of Life) and no patches or fixes will be released. They have advised users to migrate to LRAM (Lexmark Remote Administration Manager).

This vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive system files. The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
