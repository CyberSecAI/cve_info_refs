Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the event-driven architecture of Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers, where applications (apps) react to events triggered by data plane activities. The vulnerabilities arise due to:
    * Missing or unhandled event types within an application's event listener.
    * The interplay of multiple apps reacting to the same events but with incomplete or conflicting logic.
    * Control plane decisions made based on untrusted data plane inputs, leading to unintended or malicious behaviors.
**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Unhandled Event Types:** Apps often subscribe to an event kind but do not handle all the event types within that kind. For example, an app might handle the `HOST_ADDED` event but not the `HOST_UPDATED` or `HOST_MOVED` events.
* **Inconsistent Event Handling:** Different apps handle the same event types differently or not at all, leading to conflicting behaviors when multiple apps are active.
* **Cross-Plane Attacks:** Attackers can manipulate data plane inputs to influence control plane decisions. Specifically, crafted malicious packets can trigger unintended event sequences and code paths.
* **Lack of Update Handling:** Some apps do not handle update events properly, potentially leading to stale or incorrect state in the control plane.
* **Reliance on "Helper Apps":** Some apps rely on other "helper" apps to perform certain actions on their behalf. If the logic is not designed for this, vulnerabilities may arise due to the lack of coordinated responsibility.
* **Host Migration Hijacking:** The lack of proper protections against adversarial host-generated data plane input, enabling manipulation of the control plane.
* **Semantic Inconsistencies:** Attackers can use syntactically valid but semantically invalid data to cause errors and bypass security policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of these vulnerabilities includes:
* **Bypassing Access Control Policies:** Attackers can bypass firewall rules and other access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized network communication.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** By manipulating data plane input, attackers can disrupt network services or the control plane, causing denial-of-service conditions by preventing installation/removal of flow rules.
* **Stale Flow Rules:** Due to missing event handlers, stale or incorrect flow rules can remain in the network, impacting routing or security.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can manipulate events to gain control over flow rules and network behavior, effectively escalating their privileges within the network.
* **Conflicting behaviors:** Apps that are intended to work in isolation may create conflicting behaviors when used together

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Malicious Data Plane Packets:** Attackers inject crafted packets into the data plane. This can be done to cause events such as host addition, removal or movement or manipulate other network states.
* **ARP Spoofing:** Attackers spoof other hosts using ARP packets. This causes incorrect state information on the control plane.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Control over a Data Plane Host:** Attackers need to control at least one host on the data plane to inject malicious packets.
* **Knowledge of SDN Controller and Apps:** Attackers need to have knowledge of how the controller and apps work to craft attacks that target specific event handlers.
* **Ability to Inject Specific Data:** Attackers may need the ability to craft very specific packet types or inject data with a precise format in order to trigger vulnerabilities.

**Specific Vulnerabilities found (from Table 1):**
*   **CVE-2018-12691:**  `acl` app fails to handle `HOST UPDATED` events. Attackers can corrupt the controller's view of hosts and bypass access control policies by sending specific packets.
*   **CVE-2019-11189:**  `acl` app fails to handle `HOST MOVED` events. An attacker can spoof a host location, causing the `mobility` app to remove access control rules.
*   **CVE-2019-16300:** `acl` does not handle `HOST REMOVED` events, potentially leaving stale rules.
*   **CVE-2019-16298:** The `virtualbng` app doesn't handle `HOST MOVED`, `HOST REMOVED`, or `HOST UPDATED`, potentially leaving the gateway in an incorrect state.
*   **CVE-2019-16299:** The `mobility` app does not handle `HOST ADDED`, `HOST REMOVED`, or `HOST UPDATED`, thus not cleaning up the rules properly on those events.
*  **CVE-2019-16301:** The `vtn` app fails to handle `HOST MOVED` events, not updating state correctly.
*   **CVE-2019-16302:** The `evpnopenflow` app doesn't handle `HOST MOVED` or `HOST UPDATED`, potentially not updating routes correctly.
*   **CVE-2019-16297:** The `p4tutorial` app does not handle `HOST MOVED`, `HOST REMOVED`, or `HOST UPDATED` events, leading to potential inconsistencies in its state.
**Additional Points:**

* The tool EVENTSCOPE was used to identify these vulnerabilities by analyzing how different SDN controller components and applications use events.
* The paper provides context for understanding the vulnerabilities by explaining how an event flow graph can represent interactions between components, and how event interactions are leveraged for attacks.
* The identified vulnerabilities were confirmed by manual code review and testing, and the ONOS team was notified.
