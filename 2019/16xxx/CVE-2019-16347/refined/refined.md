**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `WritePixels` function
- Improper bounds checking during interlaced image decoding
- Usage of a wild pointer

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution by overwriting heap memory with attacker controlled data
- Program crash and denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted GIF file

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide the crafted GIF file as an input to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required.
