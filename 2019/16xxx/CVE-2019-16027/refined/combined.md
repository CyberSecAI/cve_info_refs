| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-dos  First Published: 2020 January 22 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2020 February 19 18:42 GMT  Version 1.2:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvr62342](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr62342)     CVE-2019-16027     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.7](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-16027     CWE-20       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-dos/csaf/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-dos.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the implementation of the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the IS-IS process.  The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) request for specific Object Identifiers (OIDs) by the IS-IS process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition in the IS-IS process.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-dos>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running Cisco IOS XR Software releases earlier than 6.6.3, 7.0.2, 7.1.1, or 7.2.1 and they configured with both the IS-IS routing protocol and SNMP versions 1, 2c, or 3.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software. Determine Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration To determine if the device is configured for IS-IS routing, administrators can use the **show running-config router isis** EXEC command in the CLI. If the device is configured for IS-IS routing, this command will return output. The following example shows the partial output of the   **show running-config router isis** command on a device that is configured for IS-IS routing.  ```   #show running-config router isis   router isis {isp}   is-type level-2-only   ...   ```  To determine if the device is configured for SNMP, administrators can use the **show running-config snmp** EXEC command in the CLI. If the device is configured for SNMP, this command will return output. The following examples show the partial output of the **show running-config snmp** command on a device that is configured for SNMP. Only one version of SNMP needs to be configured for the device to be vulnerable. The vulnerability is triggered through an SNMP query, but the configuration can be for read or write.  **SNMPv1**  ```   #show running-config snmp   snmp-server community {public ro}   ...   ```  **SNMPv2**  ```   #show running-config snmp   snmp-server group {SNMP_GROUP1} v2c   ...   ```  **SNMPv3**  ```   #show running-config snmp   snmp-server view {SNMP_VIEW1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5 included}   snmp-server group {SNMP_GROUP1} v3 {auth read SNMP_VIEW1}   ...   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software   + Cisco IOS XR7-LNT Software   + Cisco NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators may choose to perform one of the following mitigations:  **Disable SNMP:** This vulnerability is exploited by doing an SNMP query of a special MIB OID range. If SNMP is disabled, this vulnerability cannot be exploited. For mitigation of this vulnerability if SNMP is enabled on the device, contact Cisco TAC for assistance with the OIDs.  **Configure an access control list:** Administrators can also configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community to filter incoming SNMP requests to ensure that SNMP queries are performed only by trusted SNMP clients. For information about configuring ACLs, see the  [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS XR Devices](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/increase_security_ios_xr_devices.html#28).  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.6.3. Cisco also plans to fix this vulnerability in Cisco IOS XR Software releases   7.0.2, 7.1.1, and 7.2.1.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.7 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.7 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the IS-IS process.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) request for specific Object Identifiers (OIDs) by the IS-IS process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition in the IS-IS process.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-dos\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running Cisco IOS XR Software releases earlier than 6.6.3, 7.0.2, 7.1.1, or 7.2.1 and they configured with both the IS-IS routing protocol and SNMP versions 1, 2c, or 3.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.\r\n Determine Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration\r\nTo determine if the device is configured for IS-IS routing, administrators can use the show running-config router isis EXEC command in the CLI. If the device is configured for IS-IS routing, this command will return output. The following example shows the partial output of the show running-config router isis command on a device that is configured for IS-IS routing.\r\n\r\n\r\n#show running-config router isis\r\nrouter isis {isp} is-type level-2-only ...\r\n\r\nTo determine if the device is configured for SNMP, administrators can use the show running-config snmp EXEC command in the CLI. If the device is configured for SNMP, this command will return output. The following examples show the partial output of the show running-config snmp command on a device that is configured for SNMP. Only one version of SNMP needs to be configured for the device to be vulnerable. The vulnerability is triggered through an SNMP query, but the configuration can be for read or write.\r\n\r\nSNMPv1\r\n\r\n\r\n#show running-config snmp\r\nsnmp-server community {public ro} ...\r\n\r\nSNMPv2\r\n\r\n\r\n#show running-config snmp\r\nsnmp-server group {SNMP\_GROUP1} v2c ...\r\n\r\nSNMPv3\r\n\r\n\r\n#show running-config snmp\r\nsnmp-server view {SNMP\_VIEW1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5 included} snmp-server group {SNMP\_GROUP1} v3 {auth read SNMP\_VIEW1} ..."

"title": "Workarounds",
"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators may choose to perform one of the following mitigations:\r\n\r\nDisable SNMP: This vulnerability is exploited by doing an SNMP query of a special MIB OID range. If SNMP is disabled, this vulnerability cannot be exploited. For mitigation of this vulnerability if SNMP is enabled on the device, contact Cisco TAC for assistance with the OIDs.\r\n\r\nConfigure an access control list: Administrators can also configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community to filter incoming SNMP requests to ensure that SNMP queries are performed only by trusted SNMP clients. For information about configuring ACLs, see the Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS XR Devices [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/increase\_security\_ios\_xr\_devices.html#28\"]."

"title": "Fixed Software",
"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.6.3.
