The vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.  The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software later than 6.6.1 and are configured for BGP on a device with the L2VPN EVPN address family. Some device EVPN configurations, such as the **load-balancing-mode port-active** configuration, can also cause devices to be vulnerable without specific L2VPN configurations. **Determine Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration** To determine whether the device is configured for BGP, administrators can use the **show running-config router bgp** EXEC command in the CLI. If the router is configured for BGP, this command will return output.  The following example shows the partial output of the **show running-config router bgp** command on a device that is configured for BGP:  ```   # show running-config router bgprouter bgp 65536   .   .   .   ```  To determine whether the device is configured for the EVPN address family, administrators can use the **show running-config router bgp** *AS-Number* **address-family l2vpn evpn** EXEC command in the CLI**.** If the router is configured for the BGP EVPN address family, this command will return output.  The following example shows the partial output of the **show running-config router bgp** *AS-Number* **address-family l2vpn evpn** command on a device with the EVPN address family configured:  ```   # show running-config router bgp 65536 address-family l2vpn evpn   ```   ```   router bgp 100   address-family l2vpn evpn   .   .   .   ```  To determine whether the device has the EVPN configuration, administrators can use the **show running-config l2vpn** and **show running-config evpn** EXEC commands in the CLI. If the device is a provider edge router for EVPN, this command will return output.  The following examples show the **show running-config l2vpn** and **show running-config evpn** commands on a provider edge EVPN device:  ```   # show running-config l2vpn   l2vpn    bridge group      bridge-domain    .   .   .   ```   ```      interface <>      evi       !     !   !   .   .   .      ```        ```   # show running-config evpn   evpn      interface      ethernet-segment       identifier type    .   .   .   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is a next-generation solution that provides Ethernet multipoint services over MPLS networks. Customers can learn more about EVPN and configuration options in guides such as the [L2VPN and Ethernet Services Configuration Guide for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r7-0/lxvpn/configuration/guide/b-l2vpn-cg-asr9000-70x/b-l2vpn-cg-asr9000-70x_chapter_01011.html) and in guides for other platforms that support this feature.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.
