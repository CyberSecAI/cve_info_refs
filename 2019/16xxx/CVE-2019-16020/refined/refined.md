{
  "CVE-2019-16020": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of BGP update messages that contain crafted EVPN attributes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of BGP update messages with malformed EVPN attributes."
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending BGP EVPN update messages with malformed attributes to be processed by an affected system.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer. This requires the attacker to have a valid BGP peering relationship with the target or the ability to inject traffic into their BGP network."
