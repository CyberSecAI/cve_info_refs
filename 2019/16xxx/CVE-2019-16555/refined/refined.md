The provided content relates to CVE-2019-16555.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Build Failure Analyzer Plugin does not perform a permission check in a method performing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to submit a computationally expensive regular expression.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check
- Resource consumption (ReDoS)
- CSRF vulnerability as the form validation method does not require POST requests

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The request handling thread can be hung by submitting a computationally expensive regular expression causing a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By submitting a crafted HTTP request with a computationally expensive regular expression to the affected form validation endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
