Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-16973:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `app\contacts\contact_edit.php` file of FusionPBX.
- The application uses an unsanitized `query_string` variable obtained from the URL. This variable is then reflected in the HTML output, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The unsanitized input from the URL is directly embedded into the HTML, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue stems from the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of the `query_string` parameter before it is included in the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page when a victim accesses a crafted URL.
- This malicious script could perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirecting the user to a phishing page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
    - Accessing sensitive information visible to the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `query_string` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice the victim to click on the crafted URL. This could be done through various social engineering techniques.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs a way to convince a user to visit the crafted URL while the user is logged into FusionPBX.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported on 2019-08-10 and fixed on 2019-08-13.
- The fix involved modifying the `contact_edit.php` to mitigate the reflected XSS vulnerability by removing the vulnerable code.
- The CVE was assigned a base score of 6.1 (MEDIUM) by NVD.
- The affected version is FusionPBX up to v4.5.7.
