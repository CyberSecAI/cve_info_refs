The provided content is related to CVE-2019-16271.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DTEN Touchboards D7 devices run an Android OS that exposes an unauthenticated web server on port 8080. This webserver provides access to all saved whiteboards on the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated web server exposing sensitive files (whiteboard PDFs)
- Lack of authentication mechanisms

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers on the same network as the DTEN device can download saved whiteboard images in PDF format.
- Potential leakage of sensitive information such as organizational charts, intellectual property, design documents, or sales information.
- Potential for insider threats due to easy access to local files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the DTEN device.
- No authentication is needed.
