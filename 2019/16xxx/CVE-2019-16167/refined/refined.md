CVE-2019-16167
```

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `remap_struct()` function within `sa_common.c`.
*   **Vulnerability:** The `ftypes_nr[0] * ULL_ALIGNMENT_WIDTH` calculation overflows, bypassing the size check. This leads to an out-of-bounds (OOB) access during the `memset` operation.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted stat file with a large `file_magic->hdr_types_nr` (which is assigned to `ftypes_nr[0]`). The `sadf` utility is used to read the crafted file, triggering the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to a segmentation fault (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious stat file to be processed by the `sadf` utility.

The vulnerability lies in the `remap_struct` function within `sa_common.c`. Specifically, the multiplication `ftypes_nr[0] * ULL_ALIGNMENT_WIDTH` can result in an integer overflow if `ftypes_nr[0]` is sufficiently large. This overflow circumvents the subsequent size check, allowing the `memset` function to write beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
