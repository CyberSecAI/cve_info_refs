Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-16559:

**CVE-2019-16559**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing permission checks in form validation methods.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The WebSphere Deployer Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods that perform form validation, allowing users with Overall/Read access to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
    *   **CSRF:** The form validation methods do not require POST requests, making them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Users with Overall/Read access can perform connection tests to an attacker-specified server.
    *   Attackers can determine whether files with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins controller file system.
    *   Attackers can obtain limited information about the Jenkins and plugin configurations, including the ability to set plugin configuration options.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks where an attacker can send crafted HTTP requests.
    *   CSRF attack that leverages a user's active session to perform unwanted actions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins instance, either directly or through a CSRF attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that there is no fix available for this vulnerability at the time of publication.
