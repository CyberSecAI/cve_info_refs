Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-16532 (Although the Exploit-DB entry states N/A, the GitHub issue is clearly related to the CVE as the description matches).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate the `Host` header in HTTP requests. It directly uses the value from the `Host` header when constructing URLs for redirects or generating links in the HTML content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Host Header Injection:** The application is vulnerable to host header injection because it uses the `Host` header value without sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Web Cache Poisoning:** An attacker could manipulate the `Host` header in a request, causing the application to generate URLs with an attacker-controlled host. If this response is cached by a proxy server or CDN, it could poison the cache, serving malicious content to other users.
*  **Arbitrary User Redirection:** By injecting a malicious host into the `Host` header, an attacker can redirect users to a different website, potentially a phishing site or a site that delivers malware.
*   **Content Spoofing:** An attacker could manipulate the host header to cause the application to load resources from a different domain. This could be used to modify the appearance of the site and phish for credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a manipulated `Host` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, with the ability to control the `Host` header. This can be done from anywhere that can send HTTP requests, meaning an attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided PoC demonstrates how changing the `Host` header to `www.google.com` results in the application generating URLs with this host, effectively redirecting to google.com after a login redirect request.
* The application does not seem to check if the host is valid or intended before including it in response.
* The application uses the `Host` header value when generating URLs, including links to javascript, CSS, and other resources.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a more concise description and a curl-based PoC, showcasing how the injection can cause a redirect using a manipulated host.
* The original vulnerability report was communicated via email and a GitHub issue was opened, with no response from the vendor.
* The GitHub issue contains screenshots of the attack in Burp Suite, which provide more visual proof of concept.

In summary, the vulnerability lies in the YzmCMS application trusting the HTTP `Host` header without validation, which can lead to cache poisoning, arbitrary user redirection, and potential content spoofing attacks.
