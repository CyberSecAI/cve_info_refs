- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Afterlogic Aurora v8.3.9-build-a3.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This is then leveraged for session hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can steal the administrator's session cookie, leading to complete account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a log or similar view within the application. When an administrator views this page, the code executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious XSS code into a location that the administrator will view, like a log file.
