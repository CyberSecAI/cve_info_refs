# Local Privilege Escalation caused by insecure directory permissions of sys.\_MEIPATH

High

[htgoebel](/htgoebel)
published
GHSA-7fcj-pq9j-wh2r
Jan 11, 2020

## Package

PyInstaller
(Windows)

## Affected versions

< 3.6

## Patched versions

3.6

## Description

### Impact

**Local Privilege Escalation** in all **Windows software frozen by PyInstaller** in "onefile" mode.

The vulnerability is present only on Windows and in this particular case: If a **software frozen by PyInstaller in "onefile" mode** is launched by a (privileged) user who has **his/her "TempPath" resolving to a world writable directory**. This is the case e.g. if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (in which case TempPath will default to C:\Windows\Temp).

In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker has launched the exploit program. So for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).

While PyInstaller itself was not vulnerable, all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in "onefile" mode is vulnerable.

**CVSSv3 score: 7.0 (High)**

**CVSSv3 vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H**

**Affected:**

* all Windows software frozen by PyInstaller in "onefile" mode

**No affected:**

* PyInstaller itself (except if frozen by PyInstaller in "onefile" mode on Windows)
* software frozen in "one*dir*" mode
* other platforms (GNU/Linux, OS X, BSD, etc.)

### Patches

The problem is patched in commits [42a6714](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/commit/42a67148b3bdf9211fda8499fdc5b63acdd7e6cc) (fixed code) and [be948cf](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/commit/be948cf0954707671aa499da17b10c86b6fa5e5c) (recompiled bootloaders). Users should upgrade to PyInstaller version 3.6 and rebuild their software.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround: Users using PyInstaller to freeze their Windows software using "onefile" mode should upgrade PyInstaller and rebuild their software.

### Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Farid AYOUJIL ([@faridtsl](https://github.com/faridtsl)), David HA, Florent LE NIGER and Yann GASCUEL ([@lnv42](https://github.com/lnv42)) from Alter Solutions ([@AlterSolutions](https://github.com/AlterSolutions)) and fixed in collaboration with

Hartmut Goebel ([@htgoebel](https://github.com/htgoebel), maintainer of PyInstaller).

### Funding Development

PyInstaller is in urgent need of funding to make future security fixes happen, see [#4404](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4404) for details.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2019-16784

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

## Description

### An up-to-date PyInstaller saves your time!

### But: Without sustainable funding PyInstaller will become unmaintained

**If PyInstaller is in a good shape and your packages are bundled without trouble, this actually saves your time and makes your day, doesn't it?**

Please support PyInstaller development by funding. Convince your management to allocate a budget to support the improvement of PyInstaller. Our [Funding by Companies](http://www.pyinstaller.org/funding.html#funding-by-companies) web-page provides details.

### Why sustainable funding is required

While PyInstaller does quite a good job, it needs continuous maintenance, esp. updating to new package versions or Python releases. Also PyInstaller still has some rough edges and flaws. Remediating these is a lot of work - as you can seen on all these open issues and pull-requests. Too much work for a spare-time project.

Being the remaining maintainer of PyInstaller, [@htgoebel](https://github.com/htgoebel) is willed to spend more time on PyInstaller. While he can't spend more of my spare time, he could spend more of my paid time – if there is [reasonable funding](http://www.pyinstaller.org/funding.html#funding-by-companies).

**If reasonable funding is not achieved until enf of January 2020, [@htgoebel](https://github.com/htgoebel) will retire as an maintainer.** This basically means: Unless somebody else steps in, there will be nobody reviewing any pull-request, there will be not improvement and sooner or later you will not be able to use PyInstaller any more.

P.S.: Many thanks for those who donated from their personal money. We really appreciate this!

### Status

You can see the current funding status page at <http://www.pyinstaller.org/funding.html> (updated about monthly).

### What is "sustainable funding"?

To let me continue the project at a low level, at least 1,000 € per month are required - worth approx 1 day of work. This is will allow for reviewing and merging pull-requests and about 3 releases per year - but no relevant improvements .

To be able to maintain and improve PyInstaller in the long run, approx. 3 to 4 days per month are required, which is about 3,000-4,000 € per month.
