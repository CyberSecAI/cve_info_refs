  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure directory permissions for the temporary directory used by PyInstaller's 'onefile' mode on Windows.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local Privilege Escalation due to world-writable temporary directory"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation. An attacker can gain elevated privileges by exploiting the world-writable temporary directory used by the affected software.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker must have local access and be able to write to the directory pointed to by the `TempPath` environment variable of a privileged user. The vulnerability requires the targeted software to be launched or restarted after the attacker has placed an exploit in the temporary directory.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the machine and be able to write to the world-writable temp directory of the user under which the application will be executed. The attacker must have the ability to influence the start or restart of the targeted software."

    {

    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is specific to Windows and 'onefile' mode, and does not affect software frozen in 'onedir' mode or other platforms. PyInstaller itself is only affected when frozen with 'onefile' mode on Windows."
