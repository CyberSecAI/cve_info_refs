The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5186.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stack buffer overflow in the `iocheckd` service "I/O-Check" functionality of WAGO PFC200 when parsing a specially crafted XML cache file (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`). Specifically, when processing the `interface` element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow (CWE-120) due to insufficient bounds checking when copying the contents of the `interface` XML node into a stack buffer using `sprintf` and `strcpy`. The `sprintf` call overflows a 512-byte stack buffer, and a subsequent `strcpy` from the overflowed buffer results in a crash because of a missing null terminator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) of the `iocheckd` service. The service crashes, which disrupts the following functionalities:
    - `BC_FactoryRestore`: Restoring factory default settings.
    - `BC_SetSwitchMode`: Setting the network interface mode.
    - `BC_SaveParameter`: Saving network parameters, including IP address, subnet mask, gateway address, DNS server, NTP server, hostname, and domain name.
- Potential for code execution depending on the compiler and optimization level, although this is not the basic form of exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to write a malicious XML file to `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`. All users have write access to `/tmp`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `iocheckd` service parses the crafted XML file, which is triggered by sending a `BC_SaveParameter` message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to write a file to the `/tmp` directory on the target device. This does not require root privileges.
- The attacker must be able to send messages to the `iocheckd` service.
