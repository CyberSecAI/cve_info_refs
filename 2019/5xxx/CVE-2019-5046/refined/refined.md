- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs while calculating the memory required for each pixel when parsing a jpeg2000 file with large `xSiz` and `yTsiz` values. This leads to an undersized memory allocation and subsequent heap overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer overflow when calculating memory allocation size.
    - Heap-based buffer overflow due to writing outside the allocated bounds.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution by carefully manipulating the heap memory through the overflow.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted PDF file containing a malicious jpeg2000 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file and the victim has to open it using the vulnerable NitroPDF version.
