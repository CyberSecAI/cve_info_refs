Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **use-after-garbage-collection** in the Blink rendering engine of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core issue is that a memory location is accessed after it has been freed by the garbage collector. This can lead to various issues such as corruption of memory, crashes, and in some cases, arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** Exploitation leads to heap corruption, allowing the attacker to potentially overwrite memory with malicious data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by carefully crafting the HTML page to trigger the UAF vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by getting a user to visit a malicious website.
*   **Crafted HTML Page:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted HTML page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker doesn't need local access and can exploit the issue remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to visit the malicious page, thus some user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*  **Renderer Compromise:** The attacker needs to compromise the renderer process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Google Chrome versions prior to 73.0.3683.75.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Zhe Jin and Luyao Liu from Chengdu Security Response Center of Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.
