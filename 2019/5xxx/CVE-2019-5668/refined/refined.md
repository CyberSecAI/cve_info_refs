Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `DxgkDdiSubmitCommandVirtual` handler in the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`). The driver dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is actually NULL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NULL pointer dereference. The driver attempts to access memory through a pointer that has not been properly initialized or has been set to NULL, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
   - Denial of service (system crash).
   - Escalation of privileges (potentially allowing an attacker to execute code with higher privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**
   - Local access is required. The vulnerability can only be exploited by a user with local access to the system.
   - The attack is triggered through the `DxgkDdiSubmitCommandVirtual` handler in the kernel mode layer of the NVIDIA display driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine.
   - The attacker needs to be able to interact with the NVIDIA display driver to trigger the vulnerable function `DxgkDdiSubmitCommandVirtual`.
