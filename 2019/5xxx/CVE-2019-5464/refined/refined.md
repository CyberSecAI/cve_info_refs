CVE-2019-5464: SSRF Mitigation Bypass
Root cause: Flawed DNS rebinding protection in `url_blocker.rb`. The `validate` function performs DNS lookup to check if the IP address of a domain belongs to the local network. If the domain does not resolve, the DNS rebinding protection is not applied.
Vulnerability: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to a bypass in DNS rebinding protection.
Attack vector: By creating a webhook with a specially crafted URL (e.g., `http://990.hacker1.xyz`) that initially might not resolve but eventually resolves to an internal IP address.
Impact: An attacker can send arbitrary requests to the local network hosting GitLab and read the response, potentially accessing sensitive information or achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) in cloud environments.
Required attacker capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to create or modify webhooks or other features that utilize the vulnerable `url_blocker.rb` component and control a DNS server.
Affected versions: GitLab CE/EE 10.2 and later.
