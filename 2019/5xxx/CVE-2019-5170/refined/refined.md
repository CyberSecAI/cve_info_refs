The provided content is a vulnerability report from Talos, and it includes details for CVE-2019-5170.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `iocheckd` service on the WAGO PFC200 uses a file-backed cache (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`) for network configuration. During parsing of this XML file, specific node values are used to construct OS commands that are executed via `system()`. The `hostname` node is one of them, where the extracted value is used as an argument in the command `/etc/config-tools/change_hostname hostname=<contents of hostname node>`. This allows for command injection if a malicious value is placed in the XML file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection: The program uses user-controlled input (values from the XML file) to construct OS commands without proper sanitization. This enables command injection through the `hostname` node.
- Insecure File Permissions: The `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file is globally writeable, allowing any user to write malicious content to it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: Since commands are executed as root, a successful exploit allows an attacker to gain root privileges on the device.
- Arbitrary Command Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands by injecting malicious commands into the XML cache file.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must place the malicious XML file at `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending the `BC_SaveParameter` message, causing the `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file to be parsed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a user account on the device and network access to send the trigger message.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to the `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file.
- The attacker must know how to trigger the parsing of the malicious XML cache file via the `BC_SaveParameter` message.
