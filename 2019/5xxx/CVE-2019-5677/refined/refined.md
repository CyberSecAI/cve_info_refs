- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DeviceIoControl`, where the software reads from a buffer using mechanisms (indexes or pointers) that reference memory locations outside the intended buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service, due to the software reading from an invalid memory location.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker who can execute code to interact with the driver's `DeviceIoControl` interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally, with low privileges. The attack does not require any user interaction.
