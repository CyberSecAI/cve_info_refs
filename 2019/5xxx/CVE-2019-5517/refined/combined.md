##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion vertex shader out-of-bounds read vulnerability**

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion updates address an out-of-bounds vulnerability with the vertex shader functionality.  Exploitation of this issue requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled.  Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM.  The workaround for this issue involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature. This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.

VMware would like to thank Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2019-5516 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**b. VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion multiple shader translator out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities**

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion contain multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the shader translator. Exploitation of these issues requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled.  Successful exploitation of these issues may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM.  The workaround for these issues involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature.  This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.

VMware would like to thank RanchoIce of Tencent Security ZhanluLab for reporting these issues to us.
