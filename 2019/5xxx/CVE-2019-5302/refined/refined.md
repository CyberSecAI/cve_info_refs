- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of two values when parsing specially crafted TD-SCDMA messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Device reboot due to infinite loop.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted TD-SCDMA messages from a rogue base station.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted TD-SCDMA messages to the affected device, meaning they need to operate a rogue base station.
