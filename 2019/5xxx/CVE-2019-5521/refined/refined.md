Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-5521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the pixel shader functionality of VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion. The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed pixel shader.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Out-of-bounds read:**  The software reads data from memory locations outside the intended buffer when processing a specially crafted shader. Specifically, when processing the `SAMPLE` instruction in a shader. The resource array index is not checked against the number of resources declared.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of the out-of-bounds read may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service condition on the host by crashing the `vmware-vmx.exe` process. This can lead to the VM becoming unresponsive. In some cases other VMs on the host or the host itself could become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Pixel Shader:** The attacker must provide a specially crafted pixel shader to trigger the vulnerability. This can be done from within the virtual machine.
-   **3D Graphics Enabled:** Exploitation requires the virtual machine to have 3D graphics enabled. This is not enabled by default on ESXi but is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.
-  **Potentially via WebGL:** It is theoretically possible to trigger this remotely through WebGL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Access to a Virtual Machine:** The attacker needs access to a virtual machine running on the vulnerable VMware product.
-   **Normal User Privileges:** An attacker with normal user privileges within the guest VM can trigger this vulnerability.
-   **Ability to provide a malicious shader:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious pixel shader for processing by the virtual graphics device.
