- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `user_id` parameter in the `/objects/subscribe.json.php` endpoint is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive information such as usernames and password hashes stored in the database. In certain configurations, it could also allow access to the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/objects/subscribe.json.php` endpoint. The malicious SQL code is inserted into the `user_id` parameter of the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
