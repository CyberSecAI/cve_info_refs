- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The kernel does not sanitize the content of callee-save registers (%r8, %r10, and %r9 in non-PTI configurations) before returning from syscalls. These registers may contain sensitive kernel data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Kernel data leak via registers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially leak addresses of kernel data structures, which could be used to further exploit the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through regular system calls, leveraging the registers used in the syscall mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute system calls.
