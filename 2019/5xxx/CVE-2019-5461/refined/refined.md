The provided content describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in GitLab's GitHub integration.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from GitLab's GitHub integration making a POST request to a URL provided by the attacker, and then following HTTP redirects. An attacker-controlled external server can respond with a 302 redirect to an internal network address. This allows the attacker to bypass network restrictions and make requests to internal services, including cloud provider instance metadata APIs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SSRF:** The core vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery, allowing an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary locations.
*   **Unvalidated redirects:** The server blindly follows redirects without proper validation, allowing redirects to internal IPs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Internal network access:** Attackers can probe and interact with internal services not directly exposed to the internet.
*   **Cloud metadata API access:** Accessing cloud provider's instance metadata APIs may lead to the ability to execute commands on the machine.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to configure the GitHub integration with an attacker-controlled external repository URL.
*   The attack is triggered when a user clicks the "Test settings and save changes" button.
*   The attacker's server responds with a 302 redirect to an internal IP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker must have a GitLab account and the ability to create or modify projects.
*   An attacker needs access to an external server under their control, able to respond to HTTP requests and send a redirect.
