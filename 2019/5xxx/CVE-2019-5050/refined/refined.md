- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A parser confusion in NitroPDF's PDF parsing functionality leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. The vulnerability occurs when `/Page` objects are incorrectly treated as `/Pages` objects, particularly when they contain a `/Kids` array and a `/Count` value, causing an out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122): The vulnerability allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.
    - Parser confusion: Incorrect interpretation of PDF object types leads to improper parsing logic.
    - Out-of-bounds read/write: The vulnerability triggers an out-of-bounds read and write due to an incorrect calculation of memory offsets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting adjacent heap memory.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a maliciously crafted PDF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious PDF file to a victim using the vulnerable software and the victim needs to open the malicious file using the vulnerable application.
