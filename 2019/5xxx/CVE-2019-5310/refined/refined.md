- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly uses user-supplied input for the `site_title` parameter without proper sanitization or encoding when rendering it in the `basic.html` file.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `site_title` field, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who view the affected page. This could lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.

- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/app/admin/controller/System.php` endpoint, with the malicious JavaScript payload in the `site_title` parameter.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator user or a user with the necessary privileges to modify the system settings. They need to have network access to the vulnerable application.
