### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5052 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5052)

#### Description

An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file in SDL2\_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted file can cause an integer overflow, resulting in too little memory being allocated, which can lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.

An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file in SDL2\_image, version 2.0.4. A missing error handler can lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2\_image 2.0.4

### Product URLs

<https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-390: Detection of Error Condition Without Action

### Details

This vulnerability is present in the SDL2\_image library, which is used for loading images in different formats.

There is a vulnerability in the function responsible for loading PCX files. A specially crafted PCX file can lead to a heap buffer overflow and remote code execution.

Let’s investigate this vulnerability. After we attempt to load a malformed PCX file, the following state appears:

```

A heap-based buffer overflow appeared inside the `IMG_LoadPCX_RW` function. Let’s take a closer look at the code where the vulnerability takes place:

```
IMG_pcx.c
146	   bpl = pcxh.NPlanes * pcxh.BytesPerLine;
147	   if (bpl > surface->pitch) {
148		 error = "bytes per line is too large (corrupt?)";
149	   }
150    buf = (Uint8 *)SDL_calloc(SDL_max(bpl, surface->pitch), 1);
151    row = (Uint8 *)surface->pixels;
152    for ( y=0; y<surface->h; ++y ) {
153        /* decode a scan line to a temporary buffer first */
154        int i, count = 0;
155        Uint8 ch;
156        Uint8 *dst = (src_bits == 8) ? row : buf;
157        if ( pcxh.Encoding == 0 ) {
158            if(!SDL_RWread(src, dst, bpl, 1)) {
159                error = "file truncated";
160                goto done;
161            }
162        } else {
163            for(i = 0; i < bpl; i++) {
164                if(!count) {
165                    if(!SDL_RWread(src, &ch, 1, 1)) {
166                        error = "file truncated";
167                        goto done;
168                    }
169                    if( (ch & 0xc0) == 0xc0) {
170                        count = ch & 0x3f;
171                        if(!SDL_RWread(src, &ch, 1, 1)) {
172                            error = "file truncated";
173                            goto done;
174                        }
175                    } else
176                        count = 1;
177                }
178                dst[i] = ch;
179                count--;
180            }
181        }

		(...)

214        row += surface->pitch;
215    }

```

The overflow appears at `line 178`. It happens because, as you can see at `line 147`, the calculated `bpl` value is checked against the `surface->pitch` field. If `bpl` is bigger, the error variable is set at `line 148`, but no action is taken (like e.g in `lines 159-160` where the `goto done` instruction is executed).

That lack of action leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in a scenario where `src_bits` is equal to 8, causing the `dst` pointer to have the value of `row`, where `row == surface->pixels`.

The overflow will take place during the first iteration, when `bpl > sizeof(surface->pixels)`, or later because in `line 214` the `row` pointer is moved by the value of `surface->pitch`.

```

An attacker fulling controlling the size of overwrite and its content can turn this heap-based buffer overflow in a remote code execution.
