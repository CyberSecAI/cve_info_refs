  "CVE-2019-5051": {
    "description": "An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file in SDL2_image, version 2.0.4. A missing error handler can lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image file to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the IMG_LoadPCX_RW function within IMG_pcx.c. A check is performed to see if the calculated bytes per line (bpl) is greater than the surface pitch. However, if bpl is larger, although an error message is set, no further action is taken which results in the subsequent buffer overflow when the image data is processed",
