Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-5538:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of certificate validation during the File-Based Backup and Restore operations in VMware vCenter Server Appliance when using SCP for data transfer. This lack of validation allows for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient certificate validation: Specifically, during SCP-based backup and restore operations, the vCenter Server Appliance does not properly validate the server's SSH host key, allowing an attacker to intercept communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: A successful MITM attack can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data transmitted during backup and restore processes. This data could include configuration information, credentials, or other sensitive data contained within the vCenter Server Appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) positioning: An attacker must be positioned in between the vCenter Server Appliance and the backup target server to intercept the communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Position: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the vCenter Server Appliance and the backup target server.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without the need for valid credentials to the vCenter Server Appliance or the backup server itself, but requires control over the network path of the SCP traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects VMware vCenter Server Appliance versions 6.7 and 6.5. Version 6.0 is reported as unaffected.
- Remediation involves applying patches and manually enabling strict certificate validation by configuring the appliance to validate the SSH host key of the target server.
- The provided knowledge base article (KB75156) details the specific steps to enable strict certificate validation, which is not enabled by default even after patching.
- The fix involves setting "validateCerts": true in the /etc/applmgmt/appliance/appliance.conf and adding the SSH host key thumbprint to /etc/applmgmt/appliance/br_known_hosts
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-5537, which affects FTPS and HTTPS transfers.
