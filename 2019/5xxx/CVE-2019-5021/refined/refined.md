  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is present in Alpine Linux Docker images (versions 3.3 through 3.9) where the root user's password field in `/etc/shadow` is empty instead of being set to an invalid value. This allows an attacker with shell access or having compromised the system through another vulnerability, to gain root privileges if the system uses PAM or a similar mechanism that relies on `/etc/shadow` for authentication.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A regression in the Alpine Linux Docker image build process resulted in an empty password field for the root user in the `/etc/shadow` file, instead of an invalidated password. This makes the root account vulnerable to passwordless login if PAM or similar mechanisms relying on the shadow file are used.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Empty password field for the root user in `/etc/shadow`.",
        "Failure to disable root login in base images.",
       "Regression in build process that removed a previously applied fix."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges to root within the affected container. This can be achieved by either gaining initial shell access, or exploiting another vulnerability that provides access to the container's shell.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Compromising a service within the container.",
        "Exploiting a vulnerability in the container that gives shell access.",
        "Gaining access to the container shell through other means."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs shell access to the container or a vulnerability that allows gaining shell access. The attacker also needs the system to be using PAM or a similar authentication mechanism that uses the shadow file as a source of authentication data." ,
       "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects Alpine Linux Docker images from version 3.3 to 3.9 and edge release (20190228 snapshot). The vulnerability was fixed by setting the root password to an invalid value `root:!:` or `root:*:` instead of an empty field. Some tools may behave unexpectedly if the root account is locked with a '!' but using '*:' works around this issue.  Some NetApp products are affected because they use vulnerable Alpine Docker images.  This vulnerability is considered critical and has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8."
