Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2019-5593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper permission or value checking within the FortiGate/FortiProxy CLI console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Private Key Exposure:** A non-privileged user can obtain plaintext private keys of system's built-in local certificates. This is achieved by unsetting the encryption password of the keys. For user-uploaded local certificates, the same is possible by setting an empty password.
- **Vulnerable Configuration Backup/Restore:** Backup config files containing encrypted private keys could be restored onto vulnerable FortiOS or FortiProxy versions. This would allow the attacker to obtain the plaintext version of the keys.
- **Lack of Proper Encryption Handling:** The core issue lies in the improper handling of the encryption password for the private keys of certificates, allowing bypass or removal by unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive private keys, which can be used to impersonate or decrypt communications that rely on the affected certificates, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, or other forms of unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CLI Console Manipulation:** An attacker exploits the CLI console to remove encryption passwords (for built-in certs) or set an empty password (for user-uploaded certs) to reveal private keys.
- **Config Backup/Restore:** Attackers restore backup files to vulnerable systems to extract plaintext keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the CLI Console:** The attacker needs access to the FortiGate/FortiProxy's CLI console. Although described as non-privileged, some form of access is still required.
- **Knowledge of Commands:** Attacker needs knowledge of specific CLI commands to manipulate certificate passwords and export keys.
- **Physical/Network Access:** While not explicitly stated, the attacker requires network access to the device to use CLI or have physical access for console connection.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects both system built-in certificates and user-uploaded local certificates.
- The vulnerability also highlights a problem with how backed-up configurations are handled, as they can be exploited even after an upgrade if the backed-up configs are restored to a vulnerable system.
- The provided information contains a link to a third-party source which is: https://stuff.purdon.ca/?page_id=233
- The severity is rated as Medium with a CVSSv3 score of 4.2.
- It has been assigned the tracking number FG-IR-19-134 by Fortinet.
