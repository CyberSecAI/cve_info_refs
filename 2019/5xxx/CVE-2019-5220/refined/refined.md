- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient permission verification during the setup wizard process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass vulnerability. The system does not properly check permissions, allowing an attacker to perform certain operations during the setup wizard.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the FRP protection, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the smartphone is required. An attacker needs to manipulate the setup wizard in a specific way.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have physical possession of the affected smartphone. No special technical expertise is mentioned beyond being able to perform certain actions in the setup wizard.
