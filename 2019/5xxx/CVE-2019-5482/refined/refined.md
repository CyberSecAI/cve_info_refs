  "CVE-2019-5482": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Oracle MySQL. MySQL versions prior to 5.6.47, 5.7.29 and 8.0.19 are susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server. libcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function (`tftp_receive_packet()`) that receives data from a TFTP server. It can call `recvfrom()` with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap memory is controlled by the server.  This flaw is only triggered if the TFTP server sends an OACK without the BLKSIZE option, when a BLKSIZE smaller than 512 bytes was requested by the TFTP client.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow in the `tftp_receive_packet()` function within libcurl, specifically when the TFTP server does not include the BLKSIZE option in its OACK response after a smaller than default block size was requested by the client.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized takeover of MySQL Server, unauthorized read or modification access to a subset or all of the MySQL Server accessible data, or to a hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server. Could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). Arbitrary code execution and/or DoS.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "TFTP"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious TFTP server,  an attacker can remotely trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted response. An attacker with network access can trigger the vulnerability.  An attacker with network access can exploit the vulnerability by sending a request with smaller than default block size.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the TFTP server sends an OACK without the BLKSIZE option after a client requested a smaller than default block size. This issue was introduced by the add of the TFTP BLKSIZE option handling. It was previously incompletely fixed by an almost identical issue called CVE-2019-5436."
