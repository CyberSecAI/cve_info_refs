- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authorization implementation logic in some Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Authorization bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can perform operations beyond the intended scope of authorization, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Specific operations performed by an attacker. This exploit requires the 'student mode' to be activated on the target device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to perform specific operations while the 'student mode' is active on a vulnerable Huawei smartphone.
