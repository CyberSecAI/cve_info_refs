# JVN#69181574 Windows 7 may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries

## Overview

Windows 7 may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.

## Products Affected

* Windows 7

## Description

In standard DLL files provided by Windows 7, there are some DLL files read from the same directory where the program resides when executing the program ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).

Microsoft states that the root cause of this vulnerability is *"Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting"*, thus there is no plan to release any security updates for Windows 7 to address this issue.

For details, refer to "[Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2018/04/04/triaging-a-dll-planting-vulnerability/)" released by Microsoft.

## Impact

If a specially crafted DLL file is located in the same directory as executable file, arbitrary code may be executed.

## Solution

**Upgrade to Windows 10**

Upgrade to the latest Windows 10 from Windows 7 according to the information provided by the developer.

**Apply Workaround**

Applying the following workarounds may mitigate the impacts of this vulnerability.

* Restrict the permission to write system directories only to an administrator, which is the Windows' initial configuration.
* Operate an Windows PC with a standard user (non-administrator) account.  An administrator account should be used only when necessary.
* Make sure there are no untrusted files in the directory where the application is installed.
* If your organization uses shared directories to place applications for organizational operations, make sure that the shared directory is set read-only for non-administrative users.
