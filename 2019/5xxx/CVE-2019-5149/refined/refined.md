CVE-2019-5149: WAGO PFC100/200 Web-Based Management (WBM) FastCGI configuration insufficient resource pool denial of service

- Root cause: The WBM web application on WAGO PFC100 and PFC200 devices runs on a lighttpd web server and uses the FastCGI module. The default configuration of this module limits the number of concurrent php-cgi processes to two.
- Weakness: Insufficient resource pool (CWE-410). The webserver is configured to allow a low number of concurrent processes.
- Impact: An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) of the entire web server, indefinitely denying legitimate access to the WBM web application.
- Attack vector: Sending multiple malicious requests to the web server.
- Required attacker capabilities: The attacker can send a POST request to `/wbm/login.php` with a large password. By sending many of these requests, the web server attempts to process them concurrently (limited to two at a time), resulting in a DoS.
