```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Accellion File Transfer appliance has a UDP service on port 8812 that acts as a gateway to the internal communication bus. This service uses Blowfish encryption, but the appliance ships with two easy-to-guess default authentication keys.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use of weak, default encryption keys.",
    "Input validation flaw in the 'insert_plugin_meta_info' function of the 'matchrep' service, allowing command injection via a call to system()."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary command execution on the remote appliance as the 'soggycat' user, which has sudo privileges to run the primary admin tool as root.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Abuse of default encryption keys to inject messages into the internal communication bus.",
    "Injection of a crafted message to the 'matchrep' service to trigger the command injection vulnerability."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Accellion File Transfer appliance."
