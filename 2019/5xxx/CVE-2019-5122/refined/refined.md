The content is related to CVE-2019-5122.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to SQL injection. Specifically, the `name` parameter in the `/objects/pluginSwitch.json.php` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the `name` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive information like usernames and password hashes stored in the database. In some configurations, it might also provide access to the underlying operating system.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/objects/pluginSwitch.json.php` endpoint, injecting SQL code through the `name` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
