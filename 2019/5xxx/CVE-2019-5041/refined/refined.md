Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-5041

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `EnumMetaInfo` function of Aspose.Words for C++ when processing a specially crafted DOC file.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability occurs during a `memcpy` operation within the `System::String::String` constructor. The size of the destination buffer (`dstString`) is fixed at 0x44 bytes, while the size of the source data (`srcString`) is controlled by the crafted DOC file, leading to an overflow when source data is larger than the destination buffer.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker must provide a malformed DOC file to the victim.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to craft a specific DOC file to trigger the vulnerability; no specific privileges are required.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on the victim's machine. Specifically, the overflow corrupts the stack, including the SEH chain, causing the application to crash. With controlled input, it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution.
*   **Details**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when the `Aspose::Words::Document` object is created with a malformed DOC file.
    *   The vulnerable code is located within `sub_10812530`, where the `dstString` buffer is defined on the stack.
    *   The size of data copied by `memcpy` is influenced by the `StringCollection`, specifically by `srcString` at `line 31`, which is later passed to the `System::String::String` constructor.
    *   The `StringCollection` is populated with data from the DOC file.
    *   The overflow happens because an uninitialized element of a `StringCollection` is accessed. The iteration over the collection depends on the `index_limit` variable, which is calculated based on the size of a `PLC` structure within the document and may not match the actual number of initialized strings in the collection.
    *   The `memcpy` operation at line 35 inside the `String` constructor is vulnerable.
*   **Affected Version:** Aspose.Words for C++ 18.11.0.0

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Marcin 'Icewall' Noga of Cisco Talos.
*   The vendor was notified on 2019-04-17, and a patch was released on 2019-08-30.
