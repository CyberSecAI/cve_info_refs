```
Root cause of vulnerability: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in AMD ATIDXX64.DLL driver due to a malformed pixel shader instruction operand.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125). Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `SINCOS` instruction within a pixel shader when it references an uninitialized register (V4) instead of the declared input register (V0).

Impact of exploitation: The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service by causing the `vmware-vmx.exe` process to crash due to the out-of-bounds memory read.

Attack vectors: A specially crafted pixel shader file is provided to the vulnerable driver. This can be achieved via:
    -   A malformed pixel shader inside a VMware guest OS.
    -   Theoretically via WEBGL (remote website).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
    -   Ability to provide a malformed pixel shader to the system.
    -   For VMware attack, the attacker must be able to execute code inside a virtual machine.
