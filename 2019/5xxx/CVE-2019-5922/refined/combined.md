# JVN#79543573 The installer of Microsoft Teams may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries

## Overview

The installer of Microsoft Teams may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.

## Products Affected

* Installer of Microsoft Teams versions prior to 1.3.00.362

## Description

The installer of Microsoft Teams contains an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html)).

Microsoft states that the root cause of this vulnerability is *"Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting"*, thus there is no plan to release any security updates to address this issue.

For details, refer to "[Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/srd/2018/04/04/triaging-a-dll-planting-vulnerability/)" released by Microsoft.

## Impact

Arbitrary code may be executed with the privilege of the user invoking the installer.

## Solution

**Use the latest installer**

Use the latest installer provided by the developer.

Also when executing the installer, be sure to check there are no suspicious files in the directory where the installer resides.

The developer states this vulnerability was fixed in Microsoft Teams version 1.3.00.362, and Microsoft Teams version 1.3.00.362 and newer versions are not affected.

Note that this vulnerability affects the installer only, thus users who have already installed the software do not need to re-install the software.
