Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5922:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insecure DLL search path within the Microsoft Teams installer. This allows the installer to load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from the application directory instead of a more secure location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL planting:** The vulnerability is caused by the "Application Directory (App Dir) DLL planting" issue. This means that if a malicious DLL is placed in the same directory as the installer, the installer will load and execute it.
- **Insecure DLL loading:** The installer doesn't validate the origin or integrity of the DLLs it loads, leading to the vulnerability.
- **CWE-427:** This is classified as an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the installer.
- **Complete compromise:** Because the user running the installer likely has higher privileges, this could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local:** The attack requires a malicious DLL to be present in the same directory as the Microsoft Teams installer.
- **User interaction required:** The user must execute the installer and unknowingly trigger the vulnerable DLL loading.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local file system access:** The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious DLL in the same directory as the installer. This could be achieved through social engineering, malware dropping, or any other means that allows writing to the victim's system.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into executing the vulnerable installer with the malicious DLL present.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Microsoft Teams installer versions prior to 1.3.00.362.
- Microsoft considers this a DLL planting issue and does not plan to release a security update.
- The vulnerability affects only the installer, not the installed software. Therefore, users who have already installed Teams do not need to reinstall.
- The fix involves using the latest installer provided by Microsoft.
- Users should always check for suspicious files in the installer directory before execution.
- The vulnerability was reported by Asuka Nakajima of NTT Secure Platform Laboratories to IPA.
