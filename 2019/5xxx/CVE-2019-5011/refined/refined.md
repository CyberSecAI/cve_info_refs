- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper updating of CleanMyMac X. The application failed to remove vulnerable components after upgrading, leaving them accessible for exploitation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incomplete cleanup of vulnerable code after updates, specifically a privileged helper tool running as root. The old, vulnerable code remains active and listening on the system, despite the application no longer using it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access can leverage this vulnerability to modify the file system with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the machine.
