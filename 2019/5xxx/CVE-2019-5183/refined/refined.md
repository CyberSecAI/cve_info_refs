The content is related to CVE-2019-5183.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A type confusion vulnerability exists in the AMD ATIDXX64.DLL driver due to a specially crafted pixel shader causing an incorrect vtable lookup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion (CWE-843) leading to a vtable lookup with an invalid type.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the host system.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted pixel shader is provided to the AMD driver, which can be triggered from a VMware guest OS or potentially through WEBGL from a remote website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted shader file. This can be achieved through a compromised VMware guest, or potentially from a remote website through WebGL.
