Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-5086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `flattenIncrementally` function within the `xcf2png` and `xcf2pnm` binaries of `xcftools`. This overflow occurs during the calculation of tile boundaries while processing XCF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code calculates the right boundary of a tile (`where.r`) using `TILE_LEFT(where.l) + TILE_WIDTH`. If `where.l` is a large positive integer (e.g., 0x7fffffe0), the addition of `TILE_WIDTH` (64) can cause an integer overflow, resulting in a negative value being assigned to `where.r` (e.g., 0x80000000). The `rect` struct members are signed integers, allowing for negative values.
*   **Incorrect Loop Termination:** Due to the integer overflow, the loop condition `where.l < spec->dim.c.r` in the `flattenIncrementally` function becomes permanently true, leading to an infinite loop. This is because after the overflow, where.l becomes negative and `spec->dim.c.r` is positive.
*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** The unexpected loop allows the `memcpy` operation within the loop to write past the allocated buffer (`rows[y]`), leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the heap-based buffer overflow, an attacker can potentially corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XCF File:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted XCF file that, when opened with `xcf2png` or `xcf2pnm` with the `-C` option, triggers the integer overflow and subsequent heap corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create a Malicious XCF File:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted XCF file with specific dimensions to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious XCF file using a vulnerable version of `xcf2png` or `xcf2pnm`. The use of the `-C` command line argument is required to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `xcftools` version 1.0.7.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Claudio Bozzato of Cisco Talos.
*   The issue is addressed in Debian LTS advisory DLA-2553-1. A regression was later discovered in the fix, and was corrected in DLA-2553-2. The original patch was not portable and did not work on 32-bit architectures.
