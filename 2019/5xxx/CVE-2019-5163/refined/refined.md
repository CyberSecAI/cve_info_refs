## CVE-2019-5163

The content relates to CVE-2019-5163, which describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in Shadowsocks-libev.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the UDPRelay functionality of Shadowsocks-libev 3.3.2. When a stream cipher and a `local_address` are used, arbitrary UDP packets can trigger a FATAL error code path, causing the server to exit.

**Vulnerability:** Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). The ss-server does not properly handle arbitrary UDP packets when using a stream cipher and a local address. Specifically, if the socket parameters passed are all 0, the error occurs, triggering the exit code path.

**Impact:** An attacker can send arbitrary UDP packets to the `ss-server` to cause a denial of service. This will terminate the `ss-server` process, interrupting service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vector:** The attacker sends arbitrary UDP data to the `ss-server`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the `ss-server` port.
*   The `ss-server` must be configured to use UDPRelay functionality.
*   The `ss-server` must be using a stream cipher (e.g., `aes-256-cfb`). AEAD ciphers are not vulnerable.
*   The `local_address` field must be set in the shadowsocks configuration, or `ss-server` is run with the `-b <ip_address>` flag.

**Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to use an AEAD cipher, which provides authentication and integrity checks, instead of a stream cipher.
