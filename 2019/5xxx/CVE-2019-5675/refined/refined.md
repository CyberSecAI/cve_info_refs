- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` does not properly synchronize shared data, such as static variables across threads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper synchronization of shared data across threads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Undefined behavior and unpredictable data changes which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privileges, or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Low privileges, no user interaction.
