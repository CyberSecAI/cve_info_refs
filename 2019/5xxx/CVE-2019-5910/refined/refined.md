**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the HOUSE GATE App for iOS using an outdated version of the `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` library. This older version is susceptible to a directory traversal vulnerability that was previously identified as CVE-2018-16202.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application is vulnerable to path traversal, meaning an attacker can manipulate file paths to access files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially access arbitrary files on the iOS device, including those related to the application. The content of these files could be disclosed to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, indicating a remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker would need to get a user to interact with a malicious link or content, to trigger the vulnerability. This could be done via crafted URLs within the app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be located remotely, needing network access to the device running the vulnerable app.
- **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed on the target device to exploit the vulnerability, just the ability to send crafted network requests or URLs to trigger the vulnerable component.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires some level of user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in HOUSE GATE App for iOS versions 1.7.8 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is a direct result of a previously known vulnerability in the underlying library (CVE-2018-16202).
