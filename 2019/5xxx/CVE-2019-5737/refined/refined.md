  "CVE-2019-5737": {
    "description": "In Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly. This keeps the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of keep-alive connections, allowing an attacker to maintain open connections by sending headers slowly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by keeping HTTP or HTTPS connections alive for long periods of time, consuming server resources.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "HTTP",
      "HTTPS"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to establish HTTP or HTTPS connections to the target server, and to send headers slowly.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121. The 40 second timeout and its adjustment by server.headersTimeout apply to this fix as in CVE-2018-12121."
