- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Weave daemon in the Nest Cam IQ Indoor allocates a limited number of TCP endpoints, and these endpoints do not have an idle timeout.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Uncontrolled resource consumption due to a static and small number of TCP endpoints.
    - Lack of idle timeout for TCP connections, leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack results in a denial of service, preventing other devices from connecting to the Weave daemon.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can establish multiple TCP connections to the Weave daemon, filling the limited number of available TCP endpoints and preventing new connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the Weave daemon over TCP. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
