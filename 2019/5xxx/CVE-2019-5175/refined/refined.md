The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5175.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the iocheckd service "I/O-Check" function of the WAGO PFC 200. Specifically, the service parses an XML cache file (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`) and uses several parameters from the XML to construct shell commands using `sprintf()` which are later executed using `system()`, without proper sanitization of the input values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command injection vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the XML file when constructing shell commands.
- Use of `system()` to execute constructed commands, allowing execution of arbitrary OS commands.
- The cache file (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`) has global write permissions, allowing any user to place a malicious file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution as root user.
- Privilege escalation: Any user can write to the XML file, and the `iocheckd` service will execute the injected commands as root.
- Full compromise of the device is possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker places a malicious XML file at `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`.
- The attacker sends a `BC_SaveParameter` message to trigger the parsing of the crafted XML file by the `iocheckd` service.
- The injected commands within the XML file are then executed as the root user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write to the `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file. Since the `/tmp` directory is globally writeable, any user (even unprivileged) on the system can create and modify this file.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted `BC_SaveParameter` message to the target device, typically on the network.
- The attacker needs to be on the network accessible to the PLC.

The specific vulnerability described for CVE-2019-5175 in this report is related to the `type` parameter within the XML file. When the `type` parameter's value is parsed, it is used to construct the command: `/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=enabled config-type=<contents of type node>`. The vulnerability allows injecting arbitrary commands using the `type` parameter of the XML file.
