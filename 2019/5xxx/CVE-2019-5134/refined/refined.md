Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a regular expression without anchors in the `PasswordCorrect()` function within the `login.php` file of the WAGO PFC100/200 Web-Based Management (WBM) system. The regex is used to locate the relevant line in the password file `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd-htpasswd.user` (or `/etc/shadow`) for password validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Anchors in Regex:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper anchoring (`^` and `$`) in the regular expression used to match usernames within the password file. The regex `/^".$username.":/"` only checks if the username starts the line, followed by a colon. This allows for unexpected matches with crafted usernames like "....." or "adm\*in".
*   **Information Disclosure:** This weak regex allows an attacker to bypass the intended username matching logic. By crafting a specific input username, the attacker can retrieve a line from the password file.
*   **Timing Attack:** Once a matching line is retrieved, the attacker can use a separate timing attack (related to CVE-2019-5135) against the `crypt()` function. This timing attack can be used to disclose the full password salt and hash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can disclose password hashes of existing users by exploiting this vulnerability. This is possible because the weak regex allows to match lines in `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd-htpasswd.user` (or `/etc/shadow`) beyond intended username.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, the disclosed password hashes could potentially be used to gain unauthorized access to the WAGO PFC devices, if cracked, leading to full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Management (WBM) Interface:** The attack vector is through the WBM interface of the WAGO PFC100/200 controllers.
*   **Crafted Authentication Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted authentication request, manipulating the username field to bypass the regex filter and to extract password hash information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WBM interface of the targeted WAGO PFC100/200 device.
*   **Understanding of Regex Logic:**  The attacker needs to be aware of the regex being used and have the ability to craft a matching username.
*   **Ability to Execute Timing Attack:** The attacker must be capable of performing a timing attack on the `crypt()` function (as described in a related vulnerability) to fully disclose the password hash.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects WAGO PFC100 and PFC200 devices.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how a crafted username can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code is in the `login.php` file within the `PasswordCorrect()` function.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2019-5134 and assigned a CVSSv3 score of 5.3.
*  The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-777: Regular Expression without Anchors.
*  The document also references a related vulnerability: TALOS-2019-0924, which is related to a timing attack against PHP crypt function.
