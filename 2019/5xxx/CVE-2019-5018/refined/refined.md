    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in SQLite's window function handling, specifically in how it manages and reuses memory related to expression lists and window partitions during SQL query processing. This can potentially lead to remote code execution.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability within SQLite's window function processing. After an expression list is rewritten to include aggregate functions, the old expression list and its window partition are freed. However, a pointer to this freed memory is later reused during a subsequent appending operation, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use-after-free in SQLite's window function handling.",
          "Incorrect memory management during the rewrite process of SQL SELECT statements that include window functions. ",
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SQL command. This can lead to:\n  - Denial of service (DoS).\n  - Potential remote code execution if an attacker can control the memory after the free operation, due to heap corruption.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By sending specially crafted SQL commands to an application or service that uses a vulnerable version of SQLite.",
        "Remote exploitation is possible when the vulnerable SQLite instance processes SQL queries from untrusted sources."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send or execute SQL commands within the affected system using a vulnerable version of SQLite. No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability, but specific knowledge of SQL and window function syntax is required to craft the malicious queries."
