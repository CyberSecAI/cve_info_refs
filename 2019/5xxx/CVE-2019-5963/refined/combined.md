## Description

Looking for something more than live chat software for your website? Zoho SalesIQ’s [WordPress plugin](https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/live-chat-for-wordpress.html?utm_source=wordpresswebpage&utm_medium=salesiqpluginpage) is super easy to use and lets you both engage with your website visitors in real time and view your prospects’ detailed website footprint.

#### What do we have in the bag for you?

#### Forever-free for 3 users

The plugin is free for up to 3 users and will come with all the basic features like live chat, visitor tracking, and file sharing that you expect in live chat software. We also have paid plans for users looking for even more punch.

#### Visitor tracking

Visitors are organized in four concentric rings based on the criteria you set, with the hottest prospects in the inner rings and the coldest visitors moved outside the rings. With this you can easily prioritize visitors and not waste your firm’s time and resources on junk leads.

#### Automated messages

Don’t wait for visitors to message you—instead, reach out to visitors on high-intent pages like your pricing or contact us pages and spark their interest with proactive chat triggers.

#### Chatbots

It doesn’t matter if you’re a hardcore coder or someone who doesn’t know the “C” of coding—SalesIQ has something for everyone. With our codeless website chatbot builder, you can build a fully functional chatbot for your website without writing a single line of code. For the coders out there, we have a programming interface with which you can customize and automate your chatbot as needed.

#### Built-in audio call and screen share to the rescue

Your operators should be smart enough to resolve almost any issue your visitors face. However, there might be issues that can’t be resolved in a couple of texts. In that case, operators can use our built-in audio call and screen share feature to solve even the most complex queries with ease.

#### Typing preview

No need to assume what your customer is typing. Our live chat helps you see what they’re typing in the chat box in real time, enabling you to answer their queries in a matter of seconds.

#### Chat routing

Customers expect immediate help without being endlessly traded from agent to agent. Direct chats to the right department or staff based on a customer’s traffic source, landing page, number of visits or chats, lead stage, and more.

#### Real-time chat translation

Assist your customers and visitors in languages they’re comfortable with. Our website live chat software automatically detects the language of incoming chats and performs two-way chat translation in real time.

#### What makes Zoho SalesIQ the best?

* Trusted by over 450,000 businesses
* Most cost-efficient customer engagement software in the industry
* We don’t compromise on your privacy

#### Testimonials

> – Apliiq

★★★★★

> Zoho helps us with everything related to getting the sale and even tracking everything on the sale. It helps our outside sales reps, our inside sales reps, and our management do their reporting.

This plugin is pretty tired. It doesn’t work with the current versions of WP and other plugins you’ll probably be using.
I was able to get Zoho IQ working for a few years but it’s now dead after updating the website and it’s not worth having my team create patches to fix it constantly. WP Bakery and the current version of WP are incompatible. Zoho should be more on top of it.
Having used many of the Zoho software offerings and plugins over the last 4 years…I’ve found they are trying to do more than they can and don’t do anything really well.
I’m switching away from all of the Zoho products and going with best of breed a la carte.
I tried their other WP plugin for a contact form I think early on and it also broke WordPress. These are the only 2 plugins that actually broke the functionality of my website.
Zoho Bookings is pretty cool but… it only integrates with Zoho Meetings which is terrible and very low quality and plain unusable. They have a lot of good ideas but the reality of it is their products are all half finished, even after 4 years of using it they have updated but nothing like their competitors. And yes I have offered suggestions quite often to their support team but they don’t have the resources to update the software very well or quickly.

In some days the plugin does not work, and without making any changes to either the website or SalesIQ.
For example today it is not running, but it is recurring sometimes it is ok sometimes it is not.
Sincerely

We use Zoho for our entire business. The capability of this platform is unlike anything else on the market. Sales IQ is a tiny yet powerful part of this with bots, tracking, CRM integration, canned messages and even the ability to see what people are typing before they hit enter.
We love Zoho, and look forward to many more happy years with Sales IQ and Zoho.

Atendeu bem o que buscava. Esse plugin é uma interface simples para adicionar o código (provido pela Zoho, necessário cadastro) para adicionar o balão de chat no site.
