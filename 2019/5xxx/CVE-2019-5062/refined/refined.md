- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way hostapd handles 802.11w security during the handshake process. Specifically, when hostapd receives an authentication and association request packet, but the authentication negotiation fails, it sends deauthentication packets to the client using the same MAC address as the initial packets. This behavior, when triggered by a malicious actor mimicking a failed association, causes a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper handling of authentication failures in the 802.11w handshake process.
    - Lack of proper validation or state management during the association process which allows an attacker to trigger deauthentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, as valid 802.11w clients are deauthenticated from the access point (AP), disrupting their network connectivity.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A). An attacker must be within wireless range of the target access point.
    - The attacker simulates an incomplete new association by sending an authentication and association request packet, then causing the handshake to fail, triggering the deauthentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be in proximity to the target access point (within wireless range).
    - The attacker must be able to forge 802.11 authentication and association request packets.
    - The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) to perform the attack.
