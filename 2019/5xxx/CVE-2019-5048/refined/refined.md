    "Vulnerability": "NitroPDF ICCBased Color Space Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
    "CWE": "CWE-122: Heap Based Buffer Overflow",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of the number of components in the ICCBased color space within a PDF file. Specifically, when processing an ICCBased color space object, NitroPDF fails to properly validate the 'N' argument, which denotes the number of components in the color space profile. If this value is not 1, 3, or 4, the software sets a value in a pointer, throws an exception that is ignored and continues execution. This leads to an out-of-bounds write on the heap during further processing of the color space profile.",
    "Weakness": "Heap Based Buffer Overflow due to incorrect number of components leading to an out-of-bounds write on the heap",
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted PDF file in NitroPDF.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file. The victim must open the crafted PDF file."
