Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5946:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an open redirect in the login screen of Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect (CWE-601): The application does not properly validate the destination URL when redirecting users after login, allowing an attacker to redirect the user to an arbitrary website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When accessing a specially crafted URL, a user may be redirected to an arbitrary website. This can be used for phishing attacks by redirecting users to a malicious site that mimics the legitimate login page.
- The vulnerability has a high confidentiality impact rating according to CVSS v3.  This could be because of the potential for an attacker to steal user credentials via a fake login page.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network (AV:N): The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
- Low attack complexity (AC:L): Exploiting the vulnerability requires little effort.
- User interaction (UI:R): Exploitation requires the user to click on a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication or privileges. (PR:N)
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that will be used to redirect the user to a site of their choosing.
