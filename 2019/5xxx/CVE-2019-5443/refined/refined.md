Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure default build options in OpenSSL when cross-compiled for Windows, combined with a misleading commit message in curl that made it possible to disable the insecure feature.
- Specifically, the vulnerability arises from curl's ability to load an OpenSSL configuration file, which could be placed by a non-privileged user in a specific location and trigger the execution of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Code Injection:** Curl for Windows was susceptible to code injection through OpenSSL engine loading.
- **Insecure Configuration Loading:** The curl build allowed loading an OpenSSL configuration file from an insecure, non-privileged path, which could trigger the execution of arbitrary code provided by the malicious configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A non-privileged user can place a malicious OpenSSL engine and config file in a predictable location on the filesystem. If a privileged user then invokes curl, this malicious code will run with the privileges of the user invoking curl.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If a privileged user or program invokes the vulnerable curl, the injected code will run with those elevated privileges, potentially allowing a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File System:** The attacker places malicious files within the `C:/usr/local/` directory on a Windows system.
- **User Trigger:**  The attack is triggered when a user (especially a privileged user) invokes a vulnerable curl executable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local file system access to the target Windows machine to create malicious files.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the specific file path (`C:/usr/local/`) where curl will search for the OpenSSL engine and config file.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability existed in the official curl-for-windows binaries before version 7.65.1_2, but not in the curl executable shipped by Microsoft with Windows 10.
- The fix involves disabling curl's ability to load OpenSSL configurations on invocation.
- This vulnerability is specific to the Windows build process, not in the core source code of libcurl.
