Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-5493:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2019-5493 Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode".
   - This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is located within Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode versions prior to 8.2.5P3.
   - It involves information disclosure to an unauthenticated attacker.
   - Successful exploitation requires "multiple non-default options be enabled." This indicates the vulnerability is not present in a default configuration, and requires specific settings to be enabled for it to be exploitable.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user to gain access to sensitive data.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Exploitation of the vulnerability results in "information disclosure to an unauthenticated attacker". The specific nature of the data disclosed is not mentioned in these documents, but it indicates a potential compromise of data confidentiality.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is network based. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely (via the network).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker must be unauthenticated.
   - The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable system.
   - The attacker needs to target Data ONTAP instances with "multiple non-default options be enabled" to successfully execute the exploit.
