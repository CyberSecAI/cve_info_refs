Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5481:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the FTP-KRB code of libcurl.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free: The memory allocated for data transfer during a Kerberized FTP session is freed twice.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious or compromised FTP server sending a very large data block can trigger a double-free condition
-  This may cause a crash, denial of service, or potentially enable arbitrary code execution due to heap corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious FTP server sending a specially crafted data block during a Kerberized FTP data transfer.
- The vulnerability is triggered if the server advertises a very large block size, causing a realloc() failure within libcurl, leading to the double-free.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control or compromise an FTP server that the vulnerable libcurl client connects to.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of libcurl's behavior with regards to how memory is allocated and freed when using Kerberized FTP.
- The attacker needs to be able to send responses to a client connecting via Kerberized FTP.
-  The attacker does not need to authenticate but needs the client to initiate a connection using the `CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL` option.
- Requires a client to explicitly enable the `CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL` option, which is a relatively uncommon configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in November 2016.
- The vulnerability affects libcurl versions 7.52.0 to 7.65.3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in libcurl version 7.66.0.
- The vulnerability is present when using the `CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL` option.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by upgrading or patching the software.
- The advisory suggests not to use `CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL` as an alternative mitigation if immediate patching is not possible.
- The double-free issue happens if realloc() fails because of a too large allocation size on a 32-bit platform.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious FTP server sends a large data block, making curl's call to `realloc()` fail.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-415: Double Free.
