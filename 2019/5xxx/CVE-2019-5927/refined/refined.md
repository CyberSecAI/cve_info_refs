Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The "an" App for iOS used an outdated version of the `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` component. This older version contained a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The application is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially access and obtain arbitrary files on the iOS device, including those related to the application. This could lead to the leakage of sensitive information contained in those files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, but it is unclear what form it takes. The document indicates this in the CVSS scoring, but more information is needed to determine specifics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, meaning they don't need physical access to the device.
*   **No privileges needed:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability
*  **User interaction required** : user needs to interact with the malicious content for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is inherited from the outdated `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` component which is associated with `CVE-2018-16202`.
*   The vulnerability affects versions 3.2.0 and earlier of the "an" App for iOS.
*   The provided CVSS scores (both V2 and V3) indicate the severity of the vulnerability as medium.
