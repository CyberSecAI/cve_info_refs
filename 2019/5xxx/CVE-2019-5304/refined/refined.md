- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation of some parameters within MPLS Echo Request messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer error vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation may cause the device to reset.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specific MPLS Echo Request messages to the target products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker needs access to the affected products and the target must use MPLS.
