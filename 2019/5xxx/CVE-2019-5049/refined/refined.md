{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking when processing shader bytecode in the `sub_32B820` function of AMD's ATIDXX64.DLL driver. An attacker can control an argument passed to this function via the shader bytecode. This argument is used in the calculation of the destination write address.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds write due to insufficient bounds checking in shader processing.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability allows for arbitrary memory corruption. This can be triggered from a VMware guest OS to cause memory corruption in the vmware-vmx.exe process on the host. Theoretically, it could also be triggered remotely via WEBGL from a website.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted pixel shader can be supplied to the AMD ATIDXX64.DLL driver. This can be done through VMware guest OS or possibly through WEBGL from a remote website.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed pixel shader to the AMD driver, either by running it within a VMware guest or potentially through a webpage with WEBGL."
