Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a mail header injection issue within the "E-mail" application of Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-74 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component 'Injection'):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input that is used to construct email headers. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into email headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can send emails with altered headers. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Spoofing the sender's address to send phishing emails.
    - Manipulating email routing by adding extra recipient headers (CC, BCC, etc)
    - Altering other email headers to bypass spam filters or introduce malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileges Required: Low (PR:L):** The attacker needs to be authenticated (logged in) with basic access privileges to the application's email functionality to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction: None (UI:N):** No user interaction is required for the attack to be successful. The attacker only needs to send a specially crafted request with the malicious header injection.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS v3:** 4.3 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
- **CVSS v2:** 4.0 (Medium) - AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

**Affected Products:**
- Cybozu Garoon versions 4.0.0 to 4.10.2

**Solution:**
- Update to version 4.10.3 or later.
