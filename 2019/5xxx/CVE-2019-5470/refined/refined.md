## CVE-2019-5470

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   An authorization issue in the security dashboard. The endpoint `/vulnerability_feedback?category=dependency_scanning` was publicly accessible, even when it should have been restricted.

**Weakness:**

*   Inadequate access control.  The vulnerability feedback endpoint was accessible to unauthorized users (public users and guests in private projects)

**Impact:**

*   Information Disclosure: Unauthorized users could access security-related information, specifically vulnerability feedback, which should have been restricted.

**Attack Vector:**

*   Direct URL access. An attacker could directly access the vulnerable endpoint using the following URL pattern: `https://gitlab.com/<UserName>/<ProjectName>/vulnerability_feedback?category=dependency_scanning`

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Knowledge of a valid GitLab project name and username/group name.
*   No authentication was required in some instances (public projects). Guest access was sufficient in other cases (private projects).

**Affected Versions:**

*   GitLab CE/EE 10.8 and later.
