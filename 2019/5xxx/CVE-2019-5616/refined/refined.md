The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5616.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Sicon-8 device implements authentication in JavaScript that runs in the user's web browser (client-side authentication).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of client-side authentication, which can be easily bypassed.
- Lack of server-side enforcement of access controls.
- Lack of modern SSL/TLS connections, leading to exposure of private information during transit.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users can bypass the authentication mechanism and read all of the configured labels and retrieve the status of the interfaces of the Sicon-8 device.
- Attackers can gain access to nominally private information, including voltage and amperage readings, potentially enabling social engineering attacks.
- The attacker can intercept and alter requests and responses between the clients and the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the Sicon-8 web interface.
- The attacker navigates to the web application and interrupts the javascript execution of the authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to access the Sicon-8 web interface via a web browser.
- Ability to manipulate the browser by quickly hitting the ESC key.
