{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A function in the bsnmp library, responsible for extracting the length from type-length-value encoding, does not properly validate the submitted length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient message length validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote user can trigger an out-of-bounds read, cause decoding of unrelated data, or crash software using the library, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack over network."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted SNMP messages with a malformed length field to the vulnerable service.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability resides in the bsnmp library, which is used for the Internet SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). The issue involves functions handling ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)."
