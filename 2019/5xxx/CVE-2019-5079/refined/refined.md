[CVE-2019-5079]:
  - Description: A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the iocheckd service “I/O-Check” functionality of WAGO PFC 200.
  - Root Cause: The vulnerability occurs because the ReadPSN message processing code in the iocheckd service uses `strcpy` to copy the PSN value from the EEPROM to a fixed-size heap buffer of 0x28 bytes without checking the size of the input.
  - Weakness: Heap buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` with a fixed-size buffer and attacker-controlled data.
  - Impact: By sending a crafted packet to overwrite the PSN value in EEPROM with a string longer than 0x28 bytes, an attacker can overflow the heap buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
  - Attack Vector: An attacker can send unauthenticated packets to the service protocol (port 6626) to trigger the vulnerability.
  - Required Capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to port 6626 of the WAGO PFC200 device. No authentication is required.
