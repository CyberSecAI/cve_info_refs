- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition exists in a detection module where the system doesn't properly lock a function, allowing multiple processes to call it simultaneously, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious application and trick the user into installing it.
