- **Root cause of vulnerability**: NVIDIA Control Panel incorrectly loads Windows system DLLs without validating the path or signature. This is a binary planting or DLL preloading attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper DLL loading, lack of path and signature validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service or information disclosure through code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local system access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local system access and user interaction (UI:R).
