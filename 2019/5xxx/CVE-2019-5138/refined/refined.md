The content is related to CVE-2019-5138.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of a custom diagnostic script feature on the Moxa AWK-3131A device, where the device executes commands defined in an encrypted diagnostic script file. The device uses a hardcoded password for encryption of these scripts (`openssl aes-256-cbc -k moxaiwroot -salt`). The system does not properly sanitize commands within the script, allowing for injection of arbitrary OS commands.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Command injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization on commands present in the diagnostic script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
    - **Use of hardcoded password:** The use of a hardcoded encryption password `moxaiwroot` makes it trivial to create malicious diagnostic script files.
   - **Execution as root:** The commands within the diagnostic scripts are executed as `root`, granting the attacker full control over the device.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device as root. This can lead to full remote control over the device, allowing the attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary code
    - Gain access to sensitive data
    - Disrupt normal operations of the device
    - Potentially use the device as a pivot point to attack the internal network.
    - Modify configurations, including executing commands such as `reboot`

- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack vector is through the web portal where diagnostic scripts are uploaded.
    - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted diagnostic script.
    - The script file is encrypted with a hardcoded password `openssl aes-256-cbc -k moxaiwroot -salt -in %s -out %s%s`

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be authenticated as a low privilege user.
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious diagnostic script file that exploits the command injection vulnerability, specifically using the reserved word `>` followed by a malicious command.
    - The attacker must have access to the web portal to upload the script.
