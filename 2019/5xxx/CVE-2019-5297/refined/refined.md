- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in a Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass. During the reset process, before FRP account verification and activation, an attacker can perform specific operations to bypass the FRP function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A logic flaw exists in the FRP implementation, allowing an attacker to bypass the intended protection mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain full access to the mobile phone, bypassing the FRP lock. This means the attacker can use the device without proper authorization or knowledge of the original owner.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires physical access to the device. The attacker needs to perform specific operations during the device reset process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have physical possession of the Huawei smartphone and be able to perform specific operations during the reset procedure.
