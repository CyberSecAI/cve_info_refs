Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from "Incorrect escaping in developer tools." This indicates that the developer tools component in Google Chrome was not properly sanitizing or escaping certain input, which could lead to unintended consequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Data Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of data within the developer tools, specifically when copying a crafted string to the clipboard.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code. The attacker could potentially gain control of the system or cause other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be local to the affected system.
- **Crafted String:** The attack relies on a crafted string that is copied to the clipboard.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine where Google Chrome is running.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to interact with the crafted string within the developer tools by copying it to the clipboard.
- **OS X:** The vulnerability is specific to OS X (macOS).

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-5819 is a critical security flaw due to the potential for arbitrary code execution. It occurs because the developer tools in Google Chrome on macOS do not properly sanitize input before being copied to the clipboard. An attacker with local access and user interaction could leverage this vulnerability to execute code on the user's system.
