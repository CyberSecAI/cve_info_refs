CVE ID: CVE-2019-5065
Description: An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the packet-parsing functionality of Blynk-Library v0.6.1. A specially crafted packet can cause an unterminated strncpy, resulting in information disclosure. An attacker can send a packet to trigger this vulnerability.

- Vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `BlynkProtocol<Transp>::processInput()` function when handling `BLYNK_CMD_REDIRECT` messages. Specifically, the code allocates 32 bytes of memory to store the new server name and then uses `strncpy` to copy the server name into the allocated buffer. If the server name is exactly 32 bytes long, `strncpy` will not null-terminate the buffer.

- Root Cause: The root cause is the use of `strncpy` without ensuring null termination when handling the `redir_serv` string, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.

- Weakness: Improper handling of string termination, leading to potential buffer over-reads. CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

- Attack vector: An attacker can send a specially crafted `BLYNK_CMD_REDIRECT` packet to the Blynk-Device. The packet's `redir_serv` string should be exactly 32 bytes long to trigger the vulnerability.

- Impact: If the heap is laid out in a specific way (specifically when using jemalloc), the missing null termination can cause `getaddrinfo` to read beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leaking sensitive information from the heap during a DNS lookup. This vulnerability is dependent on the underlying memory allocator (malloc) implementation; it is more likely to be exploitable with jemalloc than with dlmalloc/ptmalloc.
