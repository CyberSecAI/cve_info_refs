# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0854

## Blynk inc. Blynk-Library BlynkProtocol<Transp>::processInput() information disclosure vulnerability

##### September 4, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5065

### Summary

An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the packet-parsing functionality of Blynk-Library v0.6.1. A specially crafted packet can cause an unterminated strncpy, resulting in information disclosure. An attacker can send a packet to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Blynk Blynk-Library v0.6.1

### Product URLs

<https://blynk.io/>

### CVSSv3 Score

5.3 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

### Details

Blynk-Library is a small library for connecting more than 400 different embedded device models into a private or enterprise Blynk-Server instance. According to the git repository, it is the “most popular internet-of-things platform for connecting any hardware to the cloud.”

When dealing with Blynk-Server to Blynk-Device communications (and not PhoneApp to Blynk-Server), the network protocol is surprisingly simple and light:

```
| 1byte | 2byteBE | 2byteBE | <len bytes>
| type  | msg_id  |   len   |    <msg>

```

With the available message types being:

```
enum BlynkCmd
{
 BLYNK_CMD_RESPONSE       = 0,
 BLYNK_CMD_LOGIN          = 2,
 BLYNK_CMD_PING           = 6,

 BLYNK_CMD_TWEET          = 12,
 BLYNK_CMD_EMAIL          = 13,
 BLYNK_CMD_NOTIFY         = 14,
 BLYNK_CMD_BRIDGE         = 15,
 BLYNK_CMD_HARDWARE_SYNC  = 16,
 BLYNK_CMD_INTERNAL       = 17,
 BLYNK_CMD_SMS            = 18,
 BLYNK_CMD_PROPERTY       = 19,
 BLYNK_CMD_HARDWARE       = 20,
 BLYNK_CMD_HW_LOGIN       = 29,

 BLYNK_CMD_REDIRECT       = 41,
 BLYNK_CMD_DEBUG_PRINT    = 55,
 BLYNK_CMD_EVENT_LOG      = 64
};

```

The basic code flow for any packet is as such:

```
bool BlynkProtocol<Transp>::run(bool avail)
    bool BlynkProtocol<Transp>::processInput(void)
        if (state == CONNECTING && (1 == hdr.msg_id){...}
        } else {
            int BlynkProtocol<Transp>::readHeader(BlynkHeader& hdr)
            switch (hdr.type){...}

```

Of most interest right now is the `BLYNK_CMD_REDIRECT` message, which is normally used by the Blynk-Server to direct the Blynk-Device to a more suitable spot for communications.

```
//~BlynkProtocol.h:300

case BLYNK_CMD_REDIRECT: {
    if (!redir_serv) {
         redir_serv = (char*)malloc(32);     //[1]
    }
    BlynkParam param(inputBuffer, hdr.length);
    uint16_t redir_port = BLYNK_DEFAULT_PORT;

    BlynkParam::iterator it = param.begin(); //[2]
    if (it >= param.end())
        return false;
    strncpy(redir_serv, it.asStr(), 32);     //[3]
    if (++it < param.end())
        redir_port = it.asLong();
    BLYNK_LOG4(BLYNK_F("Redirecting to "), redir_serv, ':', redir_port);
    conn.disconnect();
    conn.begin(redir_serv, redir_port);      //[4]
    state = CONNECTING;
    lastHeartbeat = lastActivityIn = lastActivityOut = (BlynkMillis() - 5000UL);
} break;

```

At [1], the client will allocate 32 bytes to hold the name of the new server, which comes from the BlynkParam at [2]. The `param.begin()` function just returns a pointer to our string, nothing fancy. Next at [3], the server will copy exactly 32 bytes into the allocated buffer with `strncpy`. Now, if we take a quick look at the `strncpy` man page, we can see:

The strncpy() function is similar, except that at most “n” bytes of src are copied. If there is no null byte among the first “n” bytes of src, the string placed in dest will not be null-terminated.

Since we’re always copying 32 bytes (unless the redir\_serv string length is less than 32), `strncpy` will never actually null terminate the buffer on the heap, and thus, when the device connects again at [4], `getaddrinfo` is called, and the device will do a DNS lookup for the `redir_serv` string, which, if the heap is laid out correctly, can end up leaking useful information to an attacker.

It should be noted that this only applies for certain versions of malloc (most notably jemalloc), as normal ptmalloc/dlmalloc versions will have either a NULL dword or the size of our 32-byte `redir_serv` in the following memory slot, and as such, renders this vulnerability useless for dlmalloc/ptmalloc. But since the Blink-Library is used for so many different devices, it is possible that different version of malloc will be used.
