- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control, allowing a low-privileged attacker to execute specific commands that expose high-privilege information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Leakage, Insufficient Access Control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive high-privilege information leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to gain access to the affected network and obtain low-level permissions on the system to execute the malicious commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the affected device and must have low-level privileges on the system to execute specific commands to exploit this vulnerability.
