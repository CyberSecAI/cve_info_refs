- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The iocheckd service "I/O-Check" in WAGO PFC200 allows unauthenticated packets to overwrite the device's MAC address. A subsequent unauthenticated reboot packet then causes the device to enter a non-operational recovery state.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for a critical function (MAC address modification) and subsequent reboot leading to denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service. The device ceases network communications and requires physical access to restore normal operation.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted, unauthenticated packets via the iocheckd protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and does not require any specific position in the network since the packets are sent using the iocheckd protocol, which can be accessed via network.
