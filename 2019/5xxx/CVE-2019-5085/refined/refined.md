- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow in the calculation of the buffer size during the processing of DICOM packets, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow, heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution due to the heap overflow.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted DICOM packet to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the server hosting the vulnerable LEADTOOLS library. The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication or elevated privileges.
