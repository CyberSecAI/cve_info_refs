The content is related to CVE-2019-5140.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the diagnostic script file name within the `iw_webs` functionality. The file name is passed to `iw_system` without proper sanitization, allowing for command injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The `decryptScriptFile` function passes the user-supplied file name directly to `iw_system` without escaping or filtering special characters. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands through the file name.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device, gaining remote control.

- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted diagnostic script file name to the device.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated as a low-privilege user to exploit the vulnerability. The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
