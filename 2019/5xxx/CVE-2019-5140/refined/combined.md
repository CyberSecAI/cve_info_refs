# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0929

## Moxa AWK-3131A iw\_webs DecryptScriptFile file name Command Injection Vulnerability

##### February 24, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5140

### Summary

An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the iw\_webs functionality of the Moxa AWK-3131A firmware version 1.13. A specially crafted diagnostic script file name can cause user input to be reflected in a subsequent iw\_system call, resulting in remote control over the device. An attacker can send commands while authenticated as a low privilege user to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Version

Moxa AWK-3131A firmware version 1.13

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command (‘OS Command Injection’)

### Details

The Moxa AWK-3131A Industrial IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n wireless AP/bridge/client is a wireless networking appliance intended for use in industrial environments. It is designed to provide wireless communication capabilities to the environments in which it is deployed. Communication with the device is possible using HTTP, Telnet, and SSH.

An encrypted script file is used for diagnostics of the Moxa AWK-3131A. This script file name is passed into `iw_system` which is a thin veil for a system call. By not escaping the insertion, or filtering out special characters the file name can be forced to be executed prior to the decryption process.

This can be seen in the disassembly below:
decryptScriptFile:
0 @ 00457de8 va\_list arg\_0 = arg1
1 @ 00457dec va\_list arg\_4 = arg2
2 @ 00457df0 int32\_t var\_10c = 0
3 @ 00457df4 int32\_t var\_110 = 0
4 @ 00457e00 va\_list $a1 = arg\_0
5 @ 00457e10 iw\_system(format\_string: “openssl aes-256-cbc -d -k moxaiw…”, args\_for\_format: $a1)
6 @ 00457e24 va\_list $a1\_1 = arg\_0
7 @ 00457e30 iw\_system(format\_string: “rm “%s””, args\_for\_format: $a1\_1)
8 @ 00457e3c va\_list $a0 = arg\_4
9 @ 00457e50 $v0 = fopen($a0, “r”)
10 @ 00457e5c int32\_t var\_10c\_1 = $v0
11 @ 00457e60 int32\_t $v0\_1 = var\_10c\_1
12 @ 00457e64 if ($v0\_1 != 0) then 13 @ 0x457ea4 else 19 @ 0x457e84
