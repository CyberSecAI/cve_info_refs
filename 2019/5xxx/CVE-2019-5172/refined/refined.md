The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2019-5172.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The iocheckd service "I/O-Check" in WAGO PFC200 devices uses a file-backed cache (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`) for network configuration. During parsing of this XML file, multiple parameters, including 'ntp', are used to construct OS commands via `sprintf` and then executed via `system()`, without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs OS commands using unsanitized input from the XML cache file, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file is globally writeable, allowing any user to place a malicious file there.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Any user can write the malicious XML file and trigger the execution of commands with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker crafts a malicious XML file containing malicious OS commands within the `<ntp>` tags.
2.  The attacker places the crafted XML file at `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` which is world writeable.
3.  The attacker sends the `BC_SaveParameter` message to trigger the parsing of `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`.
4.  The `iocheckd` service parses the XML file, extracts the malicious 'ntp' value, and uses it to construct and execute a command via `system()`, with root privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a network connection to the WAGO PFC200 device.
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the `/tmp` directory of the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a `BC_SaveParameter` message to the device to trigger the parsing of the crafted XML file.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this.
