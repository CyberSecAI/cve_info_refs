Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-5695:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the local service provider component of NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver. This component incorrectly loads Windows system DLLs without validating their path or signature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DLL preloading/binary planting:** The application loads DLLs without proper validation, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs if an attacker places them in a location searched by the application before the legitimate system DLL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By loading a malicious DLL, an attacker could cause the application to crash or become unstable, leading to a denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious DLL could potentially be used to steal sensitive information.
- **Code Execution:** A malicious DLL could be used to execute arbitrary code on the system, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker must have local system access to the vulnerable machine.
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs to have privileged access on the system to exploit this vulnerability successfully

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local system access with privileged rights.
- The attacker also needs the ability to write files to locations searched by the vulnerable application before legitimate system DLL directories.
