- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation when parsing TD-SCDMA messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause an infinite loop, leading to device abnormality and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted TD-SCDMA messages from a rogue base station to an affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to transmit TD-SCDMA messages, which means they must have a rogue base station and the capability to craft these messages. The target device must also be working in TD-SCDMA mode.
