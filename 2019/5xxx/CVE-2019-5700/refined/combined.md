| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2018‑6267 | NVIDIA Tegra OpenMax driver (`libnvomx`) contains a vulnerability in which the software does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of a program, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges. | 8.4 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/) |
| CVE‑2018‑6271 | NVIDIA Tegra OpenMax driver (`libnvomx`) contains a vulnerability in which the software delivers extra data with the buffer and does not properly validate the extra data, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges. | 8.4 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2018‑6240 | NVIDIA Tegra contains a vulnerability in `BootRom` in which an attacker has the ability to write an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location, which may lead to escalation of privileges. | 8.2 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2018‑6268 | NVIDIA Tegra library contains a vulnerability in `libnvmmlite_video.so` in which referencing memory after it has been freed may lead to denial of service or possible escalation of privileges. | 7.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5700 | NVIDIA Tegra software contains a vulnerability in the boot loader, in which the boot loader does not validate the fields of the boot image, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, and information disclosure. | 7.6 | [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5699 | NVIDIA Tegra boot loader contains a vulnerability in which the software performs an incorrect bounds check, which may lead to buffer overflow, resulting in escalation of privileges and code execution. | 7.6 | [AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
