### Summary:
The Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) versions prior to 3.51 are vulnerable to unauthenticated updates to user data, including admin privilege escalation.

### Root cause of vulnerability:
Improper access control in the `ajax/lab_user_update.php` file, which allows unauthenticated users to update user information in the backend database.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The application does not verify session validity before allowing access to files in the `ajax/` directory. Specifically, the `ajax/lab_user_update.php` file lacks authentication checks.

### Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can modify user attributes, including usernames, passwords, email addresses, phone numbers, language settings, and most critically, access levels/roles. By elevating a user's role to ADMIN or SUPERADMIN, the attacker gains full control over the BLIS instance.

### Attack vectors:
An unauthenticated attacker can directly send a request to the `ajax/lab_user_update.php` file with crafted parameters to modify a user's attributes. The attacker needs to know or guess a valid UserID.

### Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker only needs network access to the BLIS instance. No prior authentication is required.
