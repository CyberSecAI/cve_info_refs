The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5173.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements used in OS commands. The iocheckd service "I/O-Check" on WAGO PFC200 uses a file-backed cache located at `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`. During parsing of this XML file, specific parameters can be used to inject OS commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The application constructs OS commands by concatenating user-supplied input from the `iocheckCache.xml` file with predefined command strings using `sprintf()`. Specifically, the `state` node's contents are incorporated into the command `/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=<contents of state node>` without proper sanitization, allowing command injection.
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file is globally writeable, allowing any user on the system to modify its contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges. This can result in:
- **Privilege Escalation:** Any user can write to the cache file and execute commands as the root user.
- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker can potentially gain complete control of the device by executing arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Malicious XML Cache File Creation:** An attacker can write a malicious XML file to `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` containing the `state` node with injected commands.
2. **Triggering Cache Parsing:** The attacker triggers the parsing of the malicious XML file by sending the `BC_SaveParameter` message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file, which can be achieved by having local access to the device, or potentially through some other vulnerability or exposed service on the device.
- **Network Access (Indirect):** The attacker needs to be able to send the `BC_SaveParameter` message to trigger the parsing.

**CVE-2019-5173 Specific Details**

The vulnerability specifically involves the `state` node within the `interfaces/X1` element in the XML cache file. When the `state` node is parsed, its contents are used as an argument to the command:

```
/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=<contents of state node>
```

By inserting commands into the `state` node, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. For example, the following XML will execute `whoami` and output it to a file `/tmp/iocheckcache_state_command_injection`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
<network>
    <interfaces>
    <X1>
        <state>enabled; echo $(whoami) > /tmp/iocheckcache_state_command_injection</state>
    </X1>
    </interfaces>
</network>
</settings>
```
