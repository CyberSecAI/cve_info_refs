This section summarizes the potential impact that this security update addresses. Descriptions use CWE™, and base scores and vectors use CVSS V3 standards.
| **CVE** | **Description** | **Base Score** | **Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2019‑5683 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the user mode video driver trace logger component. When an attacker has access to the system and creates a hard link, the software does not check for hard link attacks. This behavior may lead to code execution, denial of service, or escalation of privileges. | 8.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5684 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in DirectX drivers, in which a specially crafted shader can cause an out of bounds access of an input texture array, which may lead to denial of service or code execution. | 7.8 | [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5685 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in DirectX drivers, in which a specially crafted shader can cause an out of bounds access to a shader local temporary array, which may lead to denial of service or code execution. | 7.8 | [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5686 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` in which the software uses an API function or data structure in a way that relies on properties that are not always guaranteed to be valid, which may lead to denial of service. | 5.6 | [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5687 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` in which an incorrect use of default permissions for an object exposes it to an unintended actor, which may lead to information disclosure or denial of service. | 5.2 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L) |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation. NVIDIA recommends consulting a security or IT professional to evaluate the risk to your specific configuration.
