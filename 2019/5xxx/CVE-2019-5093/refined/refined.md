The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5093.

**Root Cause:**
An integer overflow vulnerability exists within the DICOM network response functionality of LEADTOOLS libltdic.so. This overflow occurs when calculating the size of a buffer to allocate based on user-controlled data in the Associate Request PDU, leading to heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Overflow (CWE-190):** The vulnerability arises from an integer overflow when calculating the size of the buffer to allocate. The `m_nMaxLength` field from the `LDicomAssociate` object is used in this calculation. An attacker can control this length via a crafted Associate Request PDU.
- **Heap Corruption:** Due to the integer overflow, a smaller-than-expected heap chunk is allocated.  Subsequently, a larger amount of data is written into this smaller chunk, causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution due to the heap corruption and control over the read size in the `LDicomFile::Read` function. This allows for an attacker to compromise the vulnerable server and potentially gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted DICOM Associate Request PDU over the network to a vulnerable LEADTOOLS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable LEADTOOLS server.
- The attacker must be able to construct a DICOM Associate Request PDU with specific values that trigger the integer overflow. This includes controlling the max length of the User Data section of the request.
