Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read within the vertex shader functionality of VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion. Specifically, a crafted vertex shader can cause an invalid memory access during the processing of the shader instructions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read data from a memory location outside the bounds of the allocated buffer, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the crash of the `vmware-vmx.exe` process on the host machine.
- Information Disclosure: The advisory mentions the possibility of information disclosure but the provided technical details and the Talos report focus solely on the DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted vertex shader: The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a malformed vertex shader.
- Access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled: The attacker needs access to a virtual machine (guest) with 3D acceleration enabled, from where the malicious shader can be used to crash the host.
- Potentially via WEBGL: The Talos report mentions a theoretical possibility of exploiting this issue via a remote website using WEBGL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User privileges within a guest VM: The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code inside a virtual machine.
- 3D acceleration enabled: The virtual machine must have 3D graphics acceleration enabled. This is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion, but not on ESXi.
-  Knowledge of shader programming: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious vertex shader that triggers the vulnerability.

**Technical Details (from Talos report):**
- The vulnerability lies in the processing of the `MAD` instruction within a vertex shader.
- By modifying the operand of a `MAD` instruction to reference an out-of-bounds output, an attacker can cause a read access violation in the `vmware-vmx.exe` process.
- The `sub_379490` function is responsible for calculating the output based on the attacker-supplied index, and an invalid index will cause the function to return 0xFFFFFFFF. This leads to the memory address used for reading in the next step to point to an invalid memory location.
- The vulnerability results in a crash due to an out-of-bounds memory read.

**Mitigation:**
- The workaround involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature in the virtual machine settings, though this might affect the functionality of programs using 3D rendering. The proper fix requires patching the software with the specified updates.
