- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Wacom update helper tool's `startProcess` function allows a user-supplied script argument to be executed under root context.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') (CWE-88): The `startProcess` function does not properly sanitize the user-supplied `BundleID` argument, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access can escalate their privileges to root, gaining full control of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the machine is required. An attacker can send a crafted `BundleID` argument to the `startProcess` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the target machine.
