# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0760

## Wacom update helper tool startProcess privilege escalation vulnerability

##### May 16, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5012

### Summary

An exploitable privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Wacom, driver version 6.3.32-3, update helper service in the startProcess command. The command takes a user-supplied script argument and executes it under root context. A user with local access can use this vulnerability to raise their privileges to root. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful exploit.

### Tested Versions

Wacom macOS - Driver 6.3.32-3

### Product URLs

<https://www.wacom.com/en/support/product-support/drivers>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

### CWE

CWE-88: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command (‘Argument Injection’)

### Details

Wacom update helper is a utility installed alongside of the Wacom tablet macOS application. The application is designed to interact with a tablet and allow the user to manage the tablet. A privileged helper tool is installed to update the application. The helper tool is installed as root when the application is first installed and is a LaunchD daemon, meaning it will be restarted if it is killed. The service listens locally as root over XPC.

The vulnerability arises in the `startProcess` functionality of the helper. The relevant code is shown below.

```
v4 = objc_msgSend(user_dict, "allKeys");
if ( objc_msgSend(v4, "indexOfObject:", CFSTR("BundleID")) != (void *)0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL )  [0]
{
  bundle_id = objc_msgSend(user_dict, "objectForKey:", CFSTR("BundleID"));

  install = +[InstallerControl installer](&OBJC_CLASS___InstallerControl, "installer");            [1]
  v7 = objc_msgSend(install, "bundleDictionary");
  all = objc_msgSend(v7, "allKeys");
  if ( objc_msgSend(all, "indexOfObject:", bundle_id) != (void *)0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLL )           [2]
  {
    v10 = objc_msgSend(v7, "objectForKey:", bundle_id);
    objc_msgSend(v10, "startWithDict:", user_dict);                                             [3]

```

To begin, a user dictionary is passed in and the key `BundleID` is verified to be present, [0]. From there, a stored dictionary is loaded, [1], and it is queried to verify the passed in `BundleID` is available inside of the system commands, [2]. If this key is found, the provided application is launched, [3]. At first glance, it may be unclear why this is vulnerable. However, upon looking at the available applications to launch, we find some are non-existent while others such as “Android File Transfer” will allow an attacker to write to the root file system. If a file does not exist, an attacker may be able to leverage a separate issue to write into the desired locations and gain arbitrary code execution.

### Exploit Proof of Concept

Attached with this report is an XCode project that will launch “Wacom Desktop Center” as root as a demonstration of the issue at hand.
