Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-5985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Hikari Denwa router/Home Gateway devices. This vulnerability exists within the web management interface of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The web interface of the devices is vulnerable to XSS attacks. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts into the web page viewed by a user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser. This can potentially lead to:
    -  Data theft or manipulation (e.g., session hijacking, credential harvesting)
    -  Defacement of the web interface
    -  Redirection to malicious websites
    -  Other malicious activities within the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is conducted remotely through the network, requiring no physical access to the device.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a user accessing a malicious website. The malicious website contains code that executes in the user's browser and interacts with the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the affected device; they can launch attacks from anywhere on the network or internet.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a specially crafted webpage, which will then interact with the vulnerable device.
- The attacker doesn't require any authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in multiple models of Hikari Denwa routers/Home Gateways manufactured by NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE EAST CORPORATION and NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE WEST CORPORATION
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
- The vendor recommends a firmware update to mitigate the vulnerability.
- CVSS v3 score: 6.1 (Medium)
- CVSS v2 score: 4.3 (Medium)
