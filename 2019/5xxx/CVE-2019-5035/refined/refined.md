```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 6-digit pairing codes used by Nest devices are actually Verhoeff base32 checksum values, reducing the keyspace from 32^6 to 32^5 and making brute-forcing feasible.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307). The device does not track failed authentication attempts allowing for brute-force attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful brute force of the pairing code allows an attacker to gain greater Weave access, potentially leading to full device control. If the device is in a non-configured state, the attacker can add the device to their own Nest account.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted Weave packets to the Nest Cam IQ Indoor device.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Nest device over the network and send specially crafted Weave packets. The attacker does not require prior authentication or user interaction."
