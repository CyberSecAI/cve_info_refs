# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0798

## Nest Labs Nest Cam IQ Indoor Weave PASE pairing brute force vulnerability

##### August 19, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5035

### Summary

An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Weave PASE pairing functionality of the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, version 4620002. A set of specially crafted weave packets can brute force a pairing code, resulting in greater Weave access and potentially full device control. An attacker can send specially crafted packets to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Nest Labs Nest Cam IQ Indoor version 4620002

### Product URLs

<https://store.nest.com/product/nest-cam-iq/NC3200US>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.0 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts

### Details

The Nest Cam IQ Indoor is one of Nest Labs’ most expensive and advanced devices. The surveillance camera integrates with Google Assistant, contains facial recognition technology and even has the ability to act as an 6lowpan hub for other less powerful internet-of-things devices. The main protocol that is used for setup and initial communications of Nest devices is Weave, a protocol designed strictly for IoT devices, which can run over TCP, UDP, Bluetooth and 6lowpan.

Before going into the details of the bug itself, a quick overview of the Weave protocol and terminology is needed, so for brevity, here’s a packet dissection of a sample weave packet that will be relevant later on:

Weave messages consist of three layers: message, exchange and data. The message layer [1] and exchange layer [2] are both variable sized and consist of little-endian fields as listed above. The Data Layer [5] is strictly dependent on the MessageType [3] and ProfileId [4], and every combination thereof generally has a unique message structure, which can be seen from all the parsed fields below [5]. The ProfileID is fittingly used to determine which Weave “Profile” to talk with, and likewise, the MessageType is essentially the opcode for the given Profile.

Turning back now to the vulnerability, when initially setting up any Nest device, the owner typically looks for a QRcode or a six-digit/letter code somewhere on the device which is then used as a shared secret for JPAKE authentication in the pairing process. Normally, due to the processing time required to do a single round of JPAKE authentication, the fact that JPAKE must be done online, and also the key space of six alphanumeric characters, it would be unreasonable to brute force this process, even though there is no tracking of failed authentication attempts.

Interestingly though, it turns out that the six-digit codes used by Nest are actually Verhoeff base32 checksum values. This allows a device owner to know if they typed their code in wrong, as their phone will quickly check to see if the code is a valid Verhoeff number. Regardless, this takes the key space down from 1073741824 (32^6) possible entries to 33554432 (32^5), a factor of 32 and a slightly more reasonable runtime.

When benchmarking this process, by utilizing the default WeaveDeviceManager’s PASE pairing in a loop, we can get ~100 iterations per 1.3 seconds against the device, which would allow for a full key space brute force in around one month. By writing a python implementation of the PASE pairing setup, we were able to speed up runtime, as the WeaveDeviceManager sends extra identification packets that were not necessary. Interestingly though, it seems that the main bottle neck to this is actually the Nest Camera itself, as it can only process network packets in a single threaded manner.

While needing to communicate with a device for three to four weeks might be unreasonable for brute forcing, the pairing code will stay the same for a given device across reboots, and also, if the device is ever in a non-configured state when the code has been discovered, an attacker can emulate the pairing process and add the device to their own Nest account, granting full access.

If the device is already in a paired state when an attacker authenticates with the pairing code, it is dependent on a device-to-device basis on what types of weave requests the attacker would now be authenticated to send.
