The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5071.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the `/goform/WanParameterSetting` resource of Tenda AC9 routers. Specifically, the `dns1` and `dns2` POST parameters are vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. User-supplied input in the `dns1` and `dns2` parameters is not properly sanitized before being used in a system command, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the router, potentially gaining a reverse shell with root privileges. This can lead to complete compromise of the device, allowing for a range of malicious activities such as data theft, network manipulation, or using the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/goform/WanParameterSetting` resource. The attacker must include malicious commands in the `dns1` or `dns2` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router. While the report indicates a local authenticated attacker, the provided exploit code does not require authentication. It is likely that authentication is required to access the vulnerable endpoint, implying that an attacker would need to gain access to the router's management interface, possibly through a weak password or other means. The attacker needs to know the router's IP address to send the malicious POST request.
