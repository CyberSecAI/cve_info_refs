- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `LabelSst` record parser of Aspose Aspose.Cells for C++ due to a missing bounds check on the `isst` field within a specially crafted XLS file. The `isst` field, which represents an index into an array of strings, is not validated to ensure it's within the array's boundaries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) due to missing bounds check on an array index.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. The out-of-bounds read can overwrite memory, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a malformed XLS file to a victim using the vulnerable Aspose.Cells library, the vulnerability can be triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted malicious XLS file to a victim. No special privileges or positions are required.
