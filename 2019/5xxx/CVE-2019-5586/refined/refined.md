- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Failure to sanitize input in the SSL VPN web portal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS). Multiple parameters of the error page HTTP request are vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute unauthorized code or commands.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the vulnerable parameters, an attacker can perform a reflected XSS attack when a user accesses the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload. The victim needs to access the malicious URL.
