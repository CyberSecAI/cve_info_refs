The provided content contains vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-5081.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.
- The `iocheckd` service on WAGO PFC200 devices uses `strcpy` to copy data from EEPROM to a fixed-size heap buffer (0x28 bytes) without checking the size of the source data.
- The source data is the value associated with `WAGONRSTR` in EEPROM, which can be modified by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow due to using `strcpy` with a fixed-size buffer.
- Lack of size validation before copying data using `strcpy`.
- The WAGONRSTR value can be manipulated via an unauthenticated packet.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the device.
- The crash information shows the overflow corrupts the heap metadata resulting in a crash when the heap buffer is freed.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending unauthenticated packets to the device to manipulate the `WAGONRSTR` value in EEPROM.
- The vulnerability is triggered when reading `WAGONRSTR` from EEPROM and processing it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the target device (WAGO PFC200).
- Ability to send custom packets to port 6626 (iocheckd service).
- No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in WAGO PFC200 and PFC100 devices.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the iocheckd service "I/O-Check" via the web interface.
- The provided disassembly confirms the usage of `strcpy` without size check.
