## Installation

1. Use the Plugins -> Add new -> Upload menu and select plugin’s zip file to open.
2. Wait for the upload to complete and activate the plugin.
3. After that create a map on the “Maps” page.

Alternatively, upload the folder of the plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder then follow steps 2 and the rest as above.

## FAQ

### How can I insert a map to a page?

Insert the map shortcode into the text of a page or a post where you want the map to be. Short codes can be viewed on tab “Maps”.

### Will I be able to visually edit settings and data?

Yes. There is a built-in visual editor that allows you to tune up and configure map design, colors, popups and side info with zero coding. And to insert the map on a page, you simple paste the shortcode.

### I want to execute a JavaScript instead of opening a URL when the region is clicked. Is this possible?

Yes. You can type any valid JavaScript code in the URL field of the region’s settings. Note though, that the region’s click option must be set to “Open a URL” in this case.

Here is an example of the JS code executing upon a click to the region:

javascript:window.alert(‘Hello, World!’);

### I don’t want to use popup windows. Instead, I would like to display information below the map.

Set the region’s click option to “Show more info” in the Detailed Settings section, and type the information you would like to display, or upload media.

### What kind of media can I use in the side panel displayed below the map or right of it?

Any type WordPress can deal with.

Responsive, easy to use and feature rich even in the free version.
Sometimes free plugins, are so featureless they are unusable. There is a enough features in this free version to make it worth using, and the list of features in the upgraded version seem logical at least to me.
I replaced my boring old regular html sitemap with this.
When my site takes off, I have no problem upgrading.

I played around with the free version first. If you go to the author’s website there is a demo plugin that you can install to try out all of the premium features. Being able to play with the demo convinced me to buy the premium version of the plugin. Well worth the money and customer support is great. No complaints at all.
