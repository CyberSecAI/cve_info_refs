CVE-2019-5165: Moxa AWK-3131A iw_webs hostname Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Summary:
An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the hostname processing of the Moxa AWK-3131A firmware version 1.13. A specially configured device hostname can cause the device to interpret select remote traffic as local traffic, resulting in a bypass of web authentication.

Vulnerability Details:
* Root Cause: The Moxa AWK-3131A web management portal restricts access to sensitive parts via a login portal. However, the authentication check is not enforced if the traffic originates from the AWK itself. The device interprets a request as local traffic if it comes from 127.0.0.1, its own IP address, or its own hostname.
* Weakness: By setting the device hostname to the IP address of an attacker machine, the authentication check can be bypassed because no further verification is performed.
* Attack Vector: An attacker can send authenticated SNMP requests to trigger this vulnerability after setting the device hostname to the attacker's IP address.
* Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass web authentication and access sensitive parts of the web management portal without credentials.
* Required Capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to modify the device hostname (likely requires prior authentication or another vulnerability) and send network requests to the device.

Affected Product:
Moxa AWK-3131A Firmware version 1.13

CWE:
CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel
