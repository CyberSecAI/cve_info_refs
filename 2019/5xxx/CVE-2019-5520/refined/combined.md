* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
* VMware Fusion Pro / Fusion (Fusion)

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion vertex shader out-of-bounds read vulnerability**

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion updates address an out-of-bounds vulnerability with the vertex shader functionality.  Exploitation of this issue requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled.  Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM.  The workaround for this issue involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature. This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.

VMware would like to thank Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2019-5516 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**b. VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion multiple shader translator out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities**

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion contain multiple out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the shader translator. Exploitation of these issues requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled.  Successful exploitation of these issues may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM.  The workaround for these issues involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature.  This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.

VMware would like to thank RanchoIce of Tencent Security ZhanluLab for reporting these issues to us.

# Advisory Details

April 17th, 2019
## VMware Workstation Shader Bytecode Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### ZDI-19-369ZDI-CAN-7195

| CVE ID | [CVE-2019-5520](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-5520) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 2.8, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | VMware |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Workstation |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of shader bytecode. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can trigger a read past the end of an allocated array. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | VMware has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
