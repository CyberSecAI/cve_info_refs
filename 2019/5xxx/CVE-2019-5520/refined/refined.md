Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read within the parsing of shader bytecode in VMware products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The core issue is a read operation that accesses memory beyond the allocated buffer while processing shader bytecode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the target system.
*   **Denial-of-Service:** The vulnerability can be leveraged to create a denial-of-service condition on the virtual machine.
*   **Code Execution:** It is stated that an attacker could use this vulnerability in combination with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.
*   **3D graphics enabled:** The attack requires a virtual machine to have 3D graphics enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled.
*   They need to be able to execute low-privileged code within the guest OS.
*   The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to be inside the virtual machine to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion.
*   The issue was reported by an instructor working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   VMware has released updates to address this vulnerability.
*   A workaround exists by disabling the 3D-acceleration feature, which is not enabled by default on ESXi, but is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.
*   The CVSS score is 2.8, with the vector string AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N, indicating a Local attack vector with Low privileges required.
*   The ZDI advisory provides more details than the CVE description alone.
