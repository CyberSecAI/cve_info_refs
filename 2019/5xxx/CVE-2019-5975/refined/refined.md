Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the "Portal" application of Cybozu Garoon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page, which are then executed by the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the web browser of a logged-in user accessing a malicious web page. This can potentially lead to:
  - Session hijacking/Impersonation
  - Data theft
  - Further attacks against the user

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit it remotely.
- Malicious Web Page: A user must access a malicious web page designed to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low Privileges (PR:L): The attacker needs to have basic privileges, which means being logged in to Garoon.
- User Interaction (UI:R): The attack requires user interaction, as the user needs to access a malicious page or link.
- High Attack Complexity (AC:H): The attack is not straightforward and may require specific conditions or crafted input to succeed.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and host a malicious page or inject a malicious link.
