  "cve": "CVE-2019-5057",
  "description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the PCX image-rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted PCX image can cause a heap overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "affected_versions": {
    "SDL2_image": "2.0.4"
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `IMG_LoadPCX_RW` function within `Img_PCX.c`. When parsing a PCX image, the function calculates bytes per line (bpl) based on the image header. If the attacker controls the values in the PCX header, they can manipulate the `bpl` calculation to write beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Integer overflow (indirectly related as it could influence size calculations)",
      "Insufficient bounds checking when calculating the size of data to copy"
    ],
    "impact": "Code execution. A successful exploit allows an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network via a crafted PCX image file",
      "Local system via a crafted PCX image file"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to provide or induce the loading of a specially crafted PCX image file by a vulnerable application. User interaction (opening the image) is required."
