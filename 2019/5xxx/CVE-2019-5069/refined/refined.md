- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application deserializes untrusted data without properly limiting or validating the incoming data type. Specifically, the `set` method in the application's base model class uses `unserialize` on user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data. The application does not properly validate or sanitize the input before passing it to the `unserialize` function, which allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized data and execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server. This can allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted HTTP POST request with a malicious serialized payload in a parameter such as `name`, `term`, `title` or `discount_type`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The application requires authentication to access the vulnerable endpoints, so the attacker would need to have valid credentials or be able to bypass the authentication check.
