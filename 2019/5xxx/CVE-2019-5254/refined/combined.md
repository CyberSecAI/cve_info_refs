Technique Details

HWPSIRT-2019-01067:

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker may log in to the board.

Vulnerability details:

An attacker who logs in to the board may send crafted messages from the internal network port or tamper with inter-process message packets to exploit this vulnerability. Due to insufficient validation of the message, successful exploit may cause the affected board abnormal.

HWPSIRT-2019-01071:

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker gains access to the device network.

Vulnerability details:

An attacker may send crafted messages from a FTP client to exploit this vulnerability. Due to insufficient validation of the message, successful exploit may cause the affected board out-of-bounds read and result in a denial of service condition.

HWPSIRT-2019-01072:

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker may log in to the board.

Vulnerability details:

The system dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted parameters. A successful exploit could cause a denial of service and the process reboot.

HWPSIRT-2019-01073:

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker may log in to the board.

Vulnerability details:

An attacker who logs in to the board may send crafted messages from the internal network port or tamper with inter-process message packets to exploit this vulnerability. Due to improper management of system resources, successful exploit may cause resource exhausted.

HWPSIRT-2019-01074:

This vulnerability can be exploited only when the following conditions are present:

The attacker may log in to the board.

Vulnerability details:

An attacker who logs in to the board may send crafted messages from the internal network port or tamper with inter-process message packets to exploit this vulnerability. Due to insufficient validation of the message, successful exploit may cause the affected board abnormal.
