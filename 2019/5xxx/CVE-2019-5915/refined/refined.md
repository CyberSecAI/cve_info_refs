Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-5915

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an open redirect in OpenAM (Open Source Edition). This occurs when the software improperly validates input, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that redirects users to an arbitrary website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Open Redirect: Specifically, the vulnerability is an open redirect. This means a crafted URL can redirect the user to an attacker-controlled website.
- Improper Input Validation: The software does not properly validate the input used for redirection. This allows the attacker to specify a malicious URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Phishing Attacks: A successful exploit can redirect users to malicious websites that mimic legitimate pages, enabling phishing attacks.
- Compromised Credentials: Users might unknowingly enter credentials into the fake page, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information.
- Unwanted Actions: Users might be tricked into performing unwanted actions on the redirected website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via a specially crafted URL.
- User Interaction: Exploitation requires the user to click on a malicious link or access a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute a specially crafted URL.
- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the target system.
- The attacker needs to entice the user into clicking the crafted URL.
- The attacker can be remote as the attack vector is network-based

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects OpenAM (Open Source Edition) version 13.0.
- Versions 9 and 11 are not affected.
- The vulnerability is related to the OAuth provider functionality.
- A patch has been released by OpenAM Consortium to fix the issue.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 3.4 and CVSS v2 base score is 2.6, both indicating low severity, primarily due to the requirement of user interaction and low impact on confidentiality and availability.
