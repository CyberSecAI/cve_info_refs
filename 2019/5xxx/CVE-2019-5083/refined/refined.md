- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `TIF_decode_thunderscan` function of the Accusoft ImageGear library when processing a specially crafted TIFF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) that occurs due to a size calculation error when processing a byte from the input file, leading to a buffer overflow during a `memcpy` operation. Specifically, the size calculation `(((i - 1) / 2) + 1)` can result in a larger size value than the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to remote code execution due to the out-of-bounds write, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted TIFF file to the victim. When the victim's system attempts to process the malicious TIFF file using the vulnerable `igcore19d.dll` library, the out-of-bounds write is triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed TIFF file to the victim. No special privileges or prior access are necessary to exploit this vulnerability, as it is triggered by simply loading a malicious file.
