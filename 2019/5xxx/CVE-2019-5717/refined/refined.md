{
  "CVE-2019-5717": {
    "description": "The P_MUL dissector could crash when a malformed packet contains an illegal Data PDU sequence number of 0. Such a packet may not be analyzed.",
    "root_cause": "The P_MUL dissector in Wireshark does not properly handle a malformed packet with an illegal Data PDU sequence number of 0.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The P_MUL dissector crashes when processing a malformed packet with an illegal Data PDU sequence number of 0, causing a denial of service."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash, preventing it from analyzing network traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted network packet.",
      "An attacker can inject a malformed packet onto the wire or convince someone to read a malformed packet trace file."
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malformed packet containing an illegal Data PDU sequence number of 0.",
   "more_info": "The fix involves rejecting the invalid sequence number of zero in epan/dissectors/packet-p_mul.c."
