- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in GitLab Wiki pages. Specifically, the application incorrectly converts certain Markdown strings (e.g., `.`, `..`) and potentially crafted titles, into `javascript:` links and other dangerous schemes (like `data:`, `vbscript:`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be embedded in Wiki pages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view a maliciously crafted Wiki page. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious link within a wiki page using markdown syntax. The specific syntax involves using a combination of title and content attributes with values such as `javascript:` and  `.` , which is not properly sanitized.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have permission to edit Wiki pages in a GitLab project. They can then create or modify a page to inject the malicious code. If the Wiki is set to "Everyone With Access" in a public project, then a wider audience is affected.
