    "id": "CVE-2019-5060",
    "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
  },
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "An integer overflow in the colorhash function when rendering a specially crafted XPM image.  This causes allocating too small of a buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The integer overflow leads to an undersized buffer allocation, followed by an out-of-bounds write (heap overflow), ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Displaying a specially crafted XPM image."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "affectedComponent": "XPM image rendering function of SDL2_image 2.0.4"
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
    "openSUSE Leap 15.0",
    "openSUSE Leap 15.1",
    "openSUSE Backports SLE-15",
    "openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP1",
    "SUSE Package Hub 15 SP1",
    "SUSE Package Hub 15"
  ],
  "technicalDetails": "The create_colorhash function calculates the size of the color_hash table based on the number of colors in the XPM image. The size is determined by finding the first power of 2 greater than the number of colors. The code multiplies this calculated value by sizeof(struct hash_entry **), which can lead to an integer overflow if the number of colors is sufficiently large.  This overflow results in a smaller than expected buffer allocation for the hash table. Later, when the code attempts to add colors to the hash table using the add_colorhash function, it writes beyond the bounds of the undersized buffer, leading to a heap overflow and potential code execution."
