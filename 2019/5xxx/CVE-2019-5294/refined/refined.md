- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to a buffer read overflow error when parsing a message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer read overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may lead to abnormal service behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted or corrupt message to the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network messages to the affected device, and the device has to function as a DNS client. No authentication is required.
