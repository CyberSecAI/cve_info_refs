CVE-2019-5055: NETGEAR N300 WNR2000v5 unauthenticated host access point daemon denial-of-service vulnerability

- Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference
- Root Cause: The hostapd daemon's web_connection_check_data() function calls wps_process_msg() with invalid arguments when a specific SOAP request is sent in an invalid sequence to the <WFAWLANConfig:1#PutMessage> service. This occurs because there is no validation to check if M1 data has been received, which is normally done by the GetDeviceInfo() method. If GetDeviceInfo() hasn't been called since the daemon started, the program crashes when attempting to dereference a structure passed to wps_process_msg.
- Impact: Crash of the hostapd service, leading to denial of service.
- Attack Vector: Sending a specially crafted SOAP request to the /wps_control endpoint.
- Required Capabilities: Unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted SOAP request to trigger the vulnerability.
