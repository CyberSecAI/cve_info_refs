- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds memory write due to an incorrect size calculation when reading data from a BMP file. Specifically, the size used for the read operation is derived from the `biClrUsed` field in the BMP header, while the memory allocated for the data is of a static size. This discrepancy causes a heap buffer overflow when the `biClrUsed` field indicates a larger size than allocated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write, heap memory corruption. The vulnerability is due to the lack of bounds checking on the allocated memory block size.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted BMP file that triggers the out-of-bounds write when opened by Able2Extract Professional.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious BMP file to a user and have them open it with the vulnerable software. The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special access to the system.
