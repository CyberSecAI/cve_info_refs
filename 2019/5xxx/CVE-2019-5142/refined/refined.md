- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper filtering of data passed to and retrieved from flash memory during the setting of the device hostname. Specifically, the `iw_system` function is used to execute a command that is vulnerable to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78) due to insufficient sanitization of the hostname input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Execution of arbitrary system commands, leading to full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending authenticated requests via web or telnet to modify the device's hostname.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device's web or telnet interface.
