This document describes multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the iocheckd service of WAGO PFC200 controllers. It provides specific details for CVE-2019-5176 and related CVEs, 2019-5177 through 2019-5182.

**Root Cause:** The `iocheckd` service parses an XML cache file (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`). Several parameters from this XML file are used in `sprintf` calls to construct commands for `/etc/config-tools`. Due to insufficient bounds checking, the data extracted from the XML can cause stack buffer overflows, leading to code execution. The file `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` is globally writable by all users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflows exist in the parsing of several XML node values, specifically:
    - `gateway` (CVE-2019-5176)
    - `domainname` (CVE-2019-5177)
    - `hostname` (CVE-2019-5178)
    - `ntp` (CVE-2019-5179)
    - `ip` (CVE-2019-5180)
    - `subnetmask` (CVE-2019-5181)
    - `type` (CVE-2019-5182)
- The vulnerabilities arise because the values extracted from the XML file are used in `sprintf` calls without proper length checks, leading to buffer overflows on the stack.
- The cache file `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` is globally writable, allowing an attacker to place a malicious XML file at the specified path.
- The `BC_SaveParameter` message triggers the parsing of the malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in code execution on the target device.
- The specific examples provided show that the overflows overwrite stack memory, leading to a segmentation fault and crash of the iocheckd service. However, since an attacker controls the overflow, they could overwrite return addresses for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must have write access to the filesystem to create/modify the `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` file with a malicious XML payload.
- The attacker must send the `BC_SaveParameter` message to trigger the parsing of the malicious file.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely if the device is exposed and reachable by an attacker capable of sending the `BC_SaveParameter` message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to write to the `/tmp` directory, which is globally writable on the target device.
- The attacker needs to send network messages to the service, triggering the `BC_SaveParameter` message to initiate the parsing of the crafted XML file.

**Additional Details:**
- Each CVE is related to a different XML node, all leading to stack buffer overflows.
- The document provides specific crash information, showing that the overflow overwrites the return pointer, resulting in a crash at address `0x58585858` in the provided example.
- Mitigation steps involve disabling the `iocheckd` service or disabling caching, using a specific `RC_WriteRegister` message.
