Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-5434:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data within the Revive Adserver's XML-RPC delivery scripts. The `unserialize()` function is used on user-supplied data without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The application directly deserializes data received from an external source (XML-RPC requests), which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Specifically, the `unserialize()` call is vulnerable in the following scripts and methods:
    - `adxmlrpc.php` and `www/delivery/axmlrpc.php` using the "what" parameter in the "openads.spc" RPC method.
    - `www/delivery/dxmlrpc.php` using the first parameter of the "pluginExecute" method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By sending a malicious serialized object, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **PHP Object Injection:** Attackers could leverage this vulnerability to inject malicious PHP objects.
- **Malware Delivery:** There is a potential that this vulnerability was used to gain access to Revive Adserver instances and deliver malware to third party websites.
- **High impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** This is reflected in the CVSSv3 score of 10.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network requests (XML-RPC).
- **XML-RPC Requests:** Attackers can send specifically crafted payloads to the XML-RPC invocation scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No privileges required:** An attacker does not need any prior authentication or user privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Revive Adserver instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Revive Adserver version 4.2.0 and later.
- As a workaround, users were advised to delete the vulnerable files: `adxmlrpc.php`, `www/delivery/axmlrpc.php`, and `www/delivery/dxmlrpc.php`.
- The provided GitHub commit (a1c3db4) shows the removal of vulnerable files as a fix.
