- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of insufficiently random values within Huawei ViewPoint products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently random value generation leading to predictable information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated, remote attacker can guess information by a large number of attempts, leading to information leakage.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, unauthenticated access over the network. Specifically, the advisory mentions the vulnerability can be exploited by accessing TCP port 22 (SSH).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the affected Huawei ViewPoint products and the capability to perform a large number of attempts to guess information.
