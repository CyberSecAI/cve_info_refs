- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The system does not sufficiently validate certain pathnames from applications during the backup and restore process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability. Insufficient validation of pathnames.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially access sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a user into installing, backing up, and restoring a malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious application and social engineer the user into installing it and performing backup and restore operations. Physical access to the device is not required.
