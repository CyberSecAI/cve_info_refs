##### 3b. VMware Workstation and Fusion network denial-of-service vulnerability - CVE-2019-5535

**Description:**

VMware Workstation and Fusion contain a network denial-of-service vulnerability due to improper handling of certain IPv6 packets. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [4.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L).

**Known Attack Vectors:**

An attacker may exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted IPv6 packet from a guest machine on the VMware NAT to disallow network access for all guest machines using VMware NAT mode. This issue can be exploited only if IPv6 mode for VMNAT is enabled.

**Resolution:**

To remediate CVE-2019-5535, update/upgrade to the versions listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Resolution Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds:**

None.

**Additional Documentations:**

None.

**Notes:**

IPv6 mode for VMNAT is not enabled by default.

**Acknowledgements:**

VMware would like to thank Carlos Garcia Prado from FireEye for reporting this issue to us.
