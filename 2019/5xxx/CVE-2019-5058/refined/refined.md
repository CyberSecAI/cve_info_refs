Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-5058:

**Vulnerability:** Heap Overflow

**Root Cause:** In SDL2_image 2.0.4, the XCF image rendering functionality contains an exploitable code execution vulnerability. Specifically, a specially crafted XCF image can trigger a heap overflow, leading to code execution. This occurs because the pitch of a surface is calculated from the width of the image, controlled by the attacker. SDL then allocates a pixel buffer based on this pitch. Later, the level width and height from the XCF level structure are parsed, which are also attacker-controlled. Using these level dimensions, a tile is loaded. The offset into the pixels buffer is calculated based on the bpp value and tile data. If level values mismatch the image values, the row pointer calculation goes out of bounds, resulting in a heap overflow during the write operation.

**Attack Vector:** Displaying a specially crafted XCF image.

**Impact:** Code execution due to the heap overflow.

**Affected Software:** SDL2_image version 2.0.4.

**Attacker Requirements:** The attacker needs to be able to display a specially crafted image to trigger the vulnerability, thus requiring user interaction.
