# CVE-2019-5060

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-5059.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-5061.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5060 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5060)

#### Description

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering function of SDL2\_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow in the colorhash function, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds, resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0842

## SDL\_image XCF Image Code Execution Vulnerability

##### July 29, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5058

### Summary

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image rendering functionality of SDL2\_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XCF image can cause a heap overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

SDL\_image 2.0.4

### Product URLs

<https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

LibSDL is a multi-platform library for easy access to low-level hardware and graphics, providing support for a large number of video games, software and emulators. The LibSDL2\_Image library is an optional component that deals specifically with parsing and displaying a variety of image file formats, creating a single, uniform API for image processing, regardless of the type.

When parsing an XCF image, the pitch of a surface is calculated from the width of the image itself. The idea to note here is the pitch is directly affected by the width of the image, which is attacker controlled [0].

```
SDL/src/video/SDL_surface.c:38

/*
* Calculate the pad-aligned scanline width of a surface
*/
static int
SDL_CalculatePitch(Uint32 format, int width)
{
    int pitch;

    /* Surface should be 4-byte aligned for speed */
    pitch = width * SDL_BYTESPERPIXEL(format); [0]
    switch (SDL_BITSPERPIXEL(format)) {
    case 1:
        pitch = (pitch + 7) / 8;
        break;
    case 4:
        pitch = (pitch + 1) / 2;
        break;
    default:
        break;
    }
    pitch = (pitch + 3) & ~3;   /* 4-byte aligning */
    return pitch;
}

```

SDL allocates a buffer to hold the pixels [2] in the image sized to parameters provided in the XCF image, including the aforementioned pitch [1].

```
SDL/src/video/SDL_surface.c:112

/* Get the pixels */
if (surface->w && surface->h) {
    /* Assumptions checked in surface_size_assumptions assert above */
    Sint64 size = ((Sint64)surface->h * surface->pitch); [1]
    if (size < 0 || size > SDL_MAX_SINT32) {
        /* Overflow... */
        SDL_FreeSurface(surface);
        SDL_OutOfMemory();
        return NULL;
    }

    surface->pixels = SDL_SIMDAlloc((size_t)size); [2]
    if (!surface->pixels) {
        SDL_FreeSurface(surface);
        SDL_OutOfMemory();
        return NULL;
    }

```

Later, an XCF level structure is parsed containing the level width and height, which is also attacker-controlled [3].

```
SDL_image/IMG_xcf.c:491

static xcf_level * read_xcf_level (SDL_RWops * src, const xcf_header * h) {
    xcf_level * l;
    int i;

    l = (xcf_level *) SDL_malloc (sizeof (xcf_level));
    l->width  = SDL_ReadBE32 (src); [3]
    l->height = SDL_ReadBE32 (src); [3]

    l->tile_file_offsets = NULL;
    i = 0;
    do {
        l->tile_file_offsets = (Uint32 *) SDL_realloc (l->tile_file_offsets, sizeof (Uint32) * (i+1));
        l->tile_file_offsets [i] = read_offset (src, h);
    } while (l->tile_file_offsets [i++]);

    return l;
}

```

Using the level width and height, a tile is loaded from the image. The pixels in an XCF are organized in a grid of tiles. These tiles have, at most, a width and height of 64 [4].

```
SDL_image/IMG_xcf.c:721

SDL_RWseek(src, level->tile_file_offsets[j], RW_SEEK_SET);
ox = tx + 64 > level->width ? level->width % 64 : 64;   [4]
oy = ty + 64 > level->height ? level->height % 64 : 64; [4]
length = ox*oy*6;

if (level->tile_file_offsets[j + 1] > level->tile_file_offsets[j]) {
    length = level->tile_file_offsets[j + 1] - level->tile_file_offsets[j];
}

tile = load_tile(src, length, hierarchy->bpp, ox, oy);

```

From the loaded tile, an offset into the pixels buffer is calculated to prepare the population of the pixels buffer from the tile data itself [5].

```
SDL_image/IMG_xcf.c:747

p8 = tile;
p16 = (Uint16 *) p8;
p = (Uint32 *) p8;

for (y = ty; y < ty + oy; y++) {
    if ((ty >= surface->h) || ((tx+ox) > surface->w)) {
        break;
    }

    row = (Uint32 *) ((Uint8 *) surface->pixels + y * surface->pitch + tx * 4); [5]

```

This row offset is populated based on the bpp value of the XCF image from the parsed hierarchy structure [6].

```
SDL_image/IMG_xcf.c:761

switch (hierarchy->bpp) {
case 4:
    for (x = tx; x < tx + ox; x++)
        *row++ = Swap32(*p++);  [6]
    break;
case 3:
    for (x = tx; x < tx + ox; x++) {
        *row = 0xFF000000;      [6]
        *row |= ((Uint32)*p8++ << 16);
        *row |= ((Uint32)*p8++ << 8);
        *row |= ((Uint32)*p8++ << 0);
        row++;
    }
    break;
...
case 2:
...
case 1:
...

```

If an attacker sets the correct level values to mismatch the image values, the row pointer will be calculated beyond the bounds of the pixels buffer. Once this pointer is written to, it will be writing out of bounds of the heap buffer, causing a heap overflow, potentially resulting in code execution.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5052 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5052)

#### Description

An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX file in SDL2\_image 2.0.4.

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5059 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5059)

#### Description

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering functionality of SDL2\_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
