The content is related to CVE-2019-5130.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the JavaScript engine of Foxit PDF Reader. The `createTemplate` and `removeTemplate` methods are not properly validating parameters which results in a sequence of template manipulation events that lead to the use-after-free condition.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in how Foxit PDF Reader handles template creation and removal via JavaScript. Specifically, the `createTemplate` and `removeTemplate` methods do not validate inputs which can cause an object to be freed and then later accessed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution. By controlling the freed memory, an attacker can manipulate the process into executing malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted PDF document. If the browser plugin extension is enabled, visiting a malicious site can also trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious PDF file or visit a malicious website if the browser plugin is enabled.
