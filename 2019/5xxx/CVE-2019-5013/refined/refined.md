- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Wacom update helper tool's `startLaunchDProcess` and `stopLaunchDProcess` functions directly pass user-supplied strings into the `launchctl` command without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary arguments into the command executed with root privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection') (CWE-88).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local access can elevate privileges to load or stop arbitrary LaunchD agents, which can lead to disabling security measures or enabling vulnerable services.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the machine is required. The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting malicious strings for the `LaunchAgent` key which are passed to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the target machine to send malicious crafted messages to the vulnerable service.
