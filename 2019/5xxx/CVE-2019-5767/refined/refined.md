       "Vulnerability": [
        "Incorrect Security UI"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can spoof the contents of the Omnibox (URL bar), potentially tricking users into believing they are on a legitimate site when they are on a malicious one.",
      "AttackVector": "The attack vector involves a crafted HTML page. When a user opens this malicious page in Chrome, it triggers the vulnerability.",
       "AttackerCapabilities": "A remote attacker could host the crafted HTML page on their server and lure users to visit it via social engineering or phishing techniques. The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the victim's system prior to the exploitation.",
       "AffectedComponent": "WebAPKs component of the Chromium browser",
        "MoreDetails": "The vulnerability lies in how the security UI for WebAPKs is displayed, making it possible to alter the address bar's contents with a deceptive address. This can trick users into entering personal information on what they believe is a safe site, but is in reality controlled by an attacker."
