*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper authentication of the Trusted OS image during the boot process.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Arbitrary code execution
    *   Denial of service
    *   Escalation of privileges
    *   Information disclosure

*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access is required.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs high privileges on the system (local access with high privileges).

**Summary**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication of the Trusted OS image during the boot process, potentially allowing an attacker with high privileges to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, escalate privileges, or disclose sensitive information.
