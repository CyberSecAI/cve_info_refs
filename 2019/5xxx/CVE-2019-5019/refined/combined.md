# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0780

## Antenna House Rainbow PDF Office server document converter getSummaryInformation NumProperties code execution vulnerability

##### February 28, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5019

### Summary

A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the PowerPoint document conversion function of Rainbow PDF Office Server Document Converter V7.0 Pro R1 (7,0,2018,1113). While parsing Document Summary Property Set stream, the getSummaryInformation function is incorrectly checking the correlation between size and the number of properties in PropertySet packets, causing an out-of-bounds write that leads to heap corruption and consequent code execution.

### Tested Versions

Antenna House Rainbow PDF Office Server Document Converter v7.0 Pro R1 for Linux64 (7,0,2018,1113)

### Product URLs

<https://www.rainbowpdf.com/trial-server-solutions/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow

### Details

Rainbow PDF is a software solution, developed by Antenna House, that converts Microsoft office 97-2016 documents into a PDF.

Office document structures are sometimes complex that contain strict restraints. Not enforcing such constraints may lead to several sides effects while parsing.

The Microsoft documentation [MS-OLEPS Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd942421.aspx) is explaining some of the structures that are needed to understand the issue described in this advisory. In particular, see below the format for `PropertySetStream`, `PropertySet` and `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset` packets.

The `PropertySetStream` is described as follow:

```
+ ByteOrder (2 bytes): MUST be set to 0xFFFE.
+ Version (2 bytes)
+ SystemIdentifier (4 bytes)
+ CLSID (16 bytes)
+ NumPropertySets (4 bytes): An unsigned integer indicating the number of property sets
+ [...] some other fields in this structure.
+ PropertySet: MUST be a PropertySet packet described here just after.
+ [...] some other fields in this structure.

```

The `PropertySet` packet is described as follow:

```
+ size (4 bytes): MUST be the total size in bytes of the PropertySet packet.
+ NumProperties (4 bytes): An unsigned integer representing the number of properties in the property set.
+ PropertyIdentifierAndOffset 0 (variable): All `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset` fields MUST be a sequence of `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset` packets.
+ Property 0 (variable): Each Property field is a sequence of property values, each of which MUST be represented by a TypedPropertyValue packet

```

The `size` field specifies it must be the total size in bytes. This is important because the vulnerability depends on the value of this field.

The `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset` packet format is described as follow:

```
+ PropertyIdentifier (4 bytes): An unsigned integer representing the property identifier of a property in the property set
+ Offset (4 bytes): An unsigned integer representing the offset in bytes from the beginning of the PropertySet packet to the beginning of the Property field for the property represented.

```

The `PropertySetStream` is a succession of `PropertySet` which themselves contain a succession of `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset`.

The function `OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getSummaryInformation` called to parse Microsoft Office PowerPoint Summary Information and Document Summary Information details and data.

The function has been stripped and is more complex than what is following, but the important lines are kept to understand the logic.

```
__int64 __fastcall OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getSummaryInformation(AHOleSummaryInformation *this)
{
  SummaryInformationdataStreamOffset = OleCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEseek( this->AHOleCompStreamObj, 0LL, 1LL);
  if ( OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getPropHeader(this) )
  {

    [...]

    if ( this->NumPropertySets )                                                                                                 [1]
    {
      return_value = 1;
      lastPropertySet = (__int64)&heapAllocated[7 * (unsigned int)(this->NumPropertySets - 1) + 8];
      while ( 1 )                                                                                                                [2]
      {
        if ( !OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getCLSID(this, (PropertySetStreamPacket + 5))
          || !OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD(this, PropertySetStreamPacket + 9) )
        {
          goto return_failed;
        }
        PropertySetStream_offset0 = OleCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEtell();
        PropertySetStreamPacket[4] = OleCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEseek(this->AHOleCompStreamObj, PropertySetStreamPacket[9]
            + SummaryInformationdataStreamOffset,0LL);
        if ( OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD(this, PropertySetStreamPacket)                                         [5]
            && OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD(this, PropertySetStreamPacket + 1) )                                 [6]
        {
          heapPropertySets = new(16LL * *PropertySetStreamPacket);                                                               [7]
          *((_QWORD *)PropertySetStreamPacket + 1) = heapPropertySets;
          NumProperties = PropertySetStreamPacket[1];
          PropertyIdentifierAndOffsetNum = NumProperties - 1;                                                                    [8]
          if ( !NumProperties )
            goto nextPropertySet;                                                                                                [12]

          while ( OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD(this, heapPropertySets) )                                         [13]
          {
            if ( !OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD(this, heapPropertySets + 1) )
              break;

            currentOffset = OleCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEtell()

            [...]

nextPropertyIdentifierAndOffsetEntry:                                                                                            [10]
            heapPropertySets += 4;                                                                                               [11]
            OleCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEseek( this->AHOleCompStreamObj, currentOffset, 0LL);
            if ( !PropertyIdentifierAndOffsetNum )
              goto nextPropertySet;
            --PropertyIdentifierAndOffsetNum;                                                                                    [9]
          }
        }
        return_value = -1;
nextPropertySet:
        PropertySetStreamPacket += 14;
        OleCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEseek(this->AHOleCompStreamObj, PropertySetStream_offset0, 0LL);
        if ( PropertySetStreamPacket == lastPropertySet )
            return return_value;
      }
    }
    return_value = 1;
  }
  else
  {
return_failed:
    return_value = -1;
  }
  return return_value;
}

```

`OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getSummaryInformation` is processing the `PropertySetStream` using the number of `PropertySet` [1] as condition and relying on an infinite loop [2], which breaks on severals conditions to process all `PropertySet` data and `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset` accordingly.

```
bool __fastcall OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD(AHOleCompStream *this, unsigned int *buffer)                        [3]
{
   bool result; // al
   if ( SBYTE4(this->getReserve) )
       result = OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getReverse(this, buffer, 4);
   else
       result = ( OleCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEread(this, buffer, 4LL) == 4);                                                  [4]
   return result;
}

```

The function `OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getSummaryInformation` uses the function `OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD` to parse data from file. Note that the function `OleCompNS::AHOleSummaryInformation::getDWORD` [3] simply reads a DWORD from the object passed as first parameter and stores it into the buffer pointed by the second parameter [4], while reading the file using the `leCompNS::AHOleCompStream::OLEread` function.

At lines [5] and [6], we can see code reading `size` and `NumProperties` for `PropertySet` packet respectively from file. Thus the `size` stored into `PropertySetStreamPacket` pointer is reused at line [7] to allocate memory for `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset` packet and pointer, named `heapPropertySets`, while the `NumProperties` is reassigned to the variable `PropertyIdentifierAndOffsetNum` at [8], which will be used to determine the boundary at [9].

Every time a new `PropertyIdentifierAndOffset` is parsed, the code jumps to `nextPropertyIdentifierAndOffsetEntry` [10], which makes the `heapPropertySets` pointer to be incremented by 4 [11]. The number of times this happens depends on the value of `NumProperties`, which is also used for loop termination [12].

Since at [11] the `heapPropertySets` pointer is incremented without checking the boundaries of the pointed buffer, a subsequent heap out-of-bounds write may occur at [13]. Thus, by keeping the `size` field small and by controlling the value of `NumProperties`, an attacker would be able to control the write at [13] and subsequently execute arbitrary code.
