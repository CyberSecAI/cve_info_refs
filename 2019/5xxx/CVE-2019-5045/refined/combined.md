# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0814

## NitroPDF jpeg2000 ssizDepth Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

##### October 9, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5045

### Summary

A specifically crafted jpeg2000 file embedded in a PDF file can lead to a heap corruption when opening a PDF document in NitroPDF 12.12.1.522. With careful memory manipulation, this can lead to arbitrary code execution. In order to trigger this vulnerability, the victim would need to open the malicious file.

### Tested Versions

NitroPDF 12.12.1.522

### Product URLs

<https://www.gonitro.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-122: Heap Based Buffer Overflow

### Details

A potential remote code execution vulnerability exists in the PDF parsing functionality of Nitro Pro. A specially crafted PDF file can cause a vulnerability resulting in potential code execution.

While parsing an embedded jpeg2000 file with an unusually large `ssizDepth` value in `siz` block of the code stream, an incorrectly sized allocation is made. Later, while further processing the file, improper checks lead to a write access of out of bounds memory on the heap. This can lead to following crash:

```
(a0e8.9a74): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

```

As can be seen from the above PageHeap output, we are accessing out of bounds memory. The size of the allocated chunk is 0x48d8. The size of the calculation happens in function `sub_180420480`, specifically in the following code:

```
.text:000000018042089D mov     rax, [rbp+20A0h+var_1900]
.text:00000001804208A4 mov     ecx, [rax+0Ch]
.text:00000001804208A7 imul    ecx, edx
.text:00000001804208AA imul    ecx, [rdi+8]
.text:00000001804208AE add     ecx, 7
.text:00000001804208B1 shr     ecx, 3
.text:00000001804208B4 mov     rax, [rbp+20A0h+var_10C0]
.text:00000001804208BB imul    ecx, [rax]
.text:00000001804208BE test    ecx, ecx
.text:00000001804208C0 jle     loc_180420

```

In the above code, the initial value in `rax+0xc` actually comes from `sub_18048DF20`, where it is calculated based on `xsiz` and `xrsiz` values from the `siz` block. The whole equation is roughly as follows:

```
buffer_size = (((((xsiz / xrsiz)) * (ssizdepth) * 3 ) + 7 ) >> 3 ) * 3

```

The above value is subsequently sign-extended before being used in an allocation function.

The relevant part in our sample testcase that triggers this vulnerability is as follows:

```
<siz>
    <lsiz>47</lsiz>
    <rsiz>ISO/IEC 15444-1</rsiz>
    <xsiz>16506</xsiz>
    <ysiz>148</ysiz>
    <xOsiz>0</xOsiz>
    <yOsiz>0</yOsiz>
    <xTsiz>2</xTsiz>
    <yTsiz>42</yTsiz>
    <xTOsiz>0</xTOsiz>
    <yTOsiz>0</yTOsiz>
    <numberOfTiles>33012</numberOfTiles>
    <csiz>3</csiz>
    <ssizSign>unsigned</ssizSign>
    <ssizDepth>74</ssizDepth>
    <xRsiz>74</xRsiz>
    <yRsiz>72</yRsiz>
    <ssizSign>unsigned</ssizSign>
    <ssizDepth>73</ssizDepth>
    <xRsiz>72</xRsiz>
    <yRsiz>72</yRsiz>
    <ssizSign>unsigned</ssizSign>
    <ssizDepth>73</ssizDepth>
    <xRsiz>72</xRsiz>
    <yRsiz>72</yRsiz>
</siz>

```

The actual overflow happens in function `sub_18041F3D0` which has three nested loops guarded by different counters. Depending on the values, index into the allocated buffer can be incremented more than once per innermost loop and eventually leads to out of bounds access on the heap, overwriting adjacent memory.

By carefully controlling other image size values in the codestream, memory region of precise size can be allocated and by controlling the content of the image this overflow can be abused to overwrite adjacent heap memory which can ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution.
