  "CVE-2019-5418": {
    "description": "There is a possible file content disclosure vulnerability in Action View. Specially crafted accept headers in combination with calls to `render file:` can cause arbitrary files on the target server to be rendered, disclosing the file contents.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of accept headers in `render file:` calls allows for arbitrary file disclosure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "File Content Disclosure",
        "Insecure Handling of Accept Headers"
      ],
      "impact": "Disclosure of arbitrary file contents on the server, possibly leading to further exploits such as RCE.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted accept headers in HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability is limited to calls to `render` which render file contents without a specified accept format. It can potentially be exploited to read the Rails secrets file and escalate to remote code execution."
