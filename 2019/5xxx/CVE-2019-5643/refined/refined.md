Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-5643:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a lack of proper access control in the Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS). Specifically, certain files in the `ajax/` directory, such as `ajax/userlog_fetch.php` and `ajax/users_select.php`, can be accessed without authentication. These files expose sensitive information, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The system fails to verify user sessions when accessing specific functionalities related to user logs and user selection.
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to enumerate facility IDs and usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can enumerate all facilities and user names in the system without any authentication. This information can be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to `ajax/userlog_fetch.php` and `ajax/users_select.php` without needing any authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the BLIS server. No prior authentication or specific privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in BLIS versions prior to 3.51.
- The blog post provides details about how Rapid7 researchers discovered and exploited this vulnerability using HTTP requests, as well as the specific vulnerable file paths.
- The provided Metasploit module demonstrates the exploitation in action.
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities related to authentication and authorization in BLIS, along with CVE-2019-5617 (unauthenticated password reset) and CVE-2019-5644 (unauthenticated user updates).
