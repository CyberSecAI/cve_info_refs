The content is related to CVE-2019-5042.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error when processing FunctionType 0 PDF elements in Aspose.PDF for C++. A heap object of size 0x78 is allocated and initialized, but later freed. However, a pointer to this memory is still in use, leading to a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free: The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. The program attempts to access memory after it has been freed.
- Dangling Pointer: After the memory is freed, a pointer still refers to it, creating a dangling pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption: By controlling subsequent memory allocations, an attacker can place arbitrary objects into the freed memory.
- Arbitrary code execution: This memory corruption can be further leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PDF: An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by Aspose.PDF for C++.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send or provide the malicious PDF to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are needed, a user that can open a PDF file is enough to trigger the vulnerability.
