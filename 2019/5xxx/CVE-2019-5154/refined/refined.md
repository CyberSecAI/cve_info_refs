- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the LEADTOOLS JPEG2000 parsing functionality due to an incorrect calculation of buffer size based on image and tile dimensions read from the SIZ marker, and usage of an attacker-controlled tile number (Isot) from the SOT marker when indexing into the allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
    - Out-of-bounds write
    - Inadequate buffer size calculation
    - Use of attacker-controlled data (Isot) to index buffer
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds write of a null byte, leading to potential code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted J2K image file with a manipulated SIZ and SOT marker can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted J2K image file to an application using the vulnerable LEADTOOLS library. User interaction is required as the user has to open the crafted file.
