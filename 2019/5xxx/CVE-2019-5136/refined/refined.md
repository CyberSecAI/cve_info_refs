The content is related to CVE-2019-5136.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A hardcoded backdoor string within the `iw_console` application allows for privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284). The application fails to properly restrict access to a root shell, allowing a low-privileged user to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain full root shell access on the device, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, modify system configurations, and potentially take complete control of the device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based via Telnet or SSH. The attacker must have valid credentials for a low-privileged user account on the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the device and valid low-privilege user credentials to log in using Telnet or SSH. They need to send the specific backdoor string ("94jo3dkru4 moxaiwroot") as input to the `iw_console` main menu.
