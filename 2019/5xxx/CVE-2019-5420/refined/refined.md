{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "In development mode, a Rails application would use its name as the secret_key_base, which can be easily extracted by visiting an invalid resource for a path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Use of application name as secret key base in development mode",
    "Lack of proper handling of serialized data leading to remote code execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution (RCE)",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted request to the `/rails/active_storage/disk/` endpoint with a serialized payload",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and know the application name. The application must be running in development mode."
