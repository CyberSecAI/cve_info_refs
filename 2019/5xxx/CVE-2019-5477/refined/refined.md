  "CVE-2019-5477": {
    "description": "A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input. This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Nokogiri < v1.10.4",
      "rexical < 1.0.7"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
        "Nokogiri >= v1.10.4",
        "rexical >= 1.0.7"
      ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of Ruby's `Kernel.open` method within the `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` method, which is an undocumented method. The vulnerable code is generated by the Rexical gem, specifically versions 1.0.6 and earlier.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Command Injection: Arbitrary commands can be executed due to the insecure use of `Kernel.open` with user-controlled input.",
      "Insecure Code Generation: Rexical versions before 1.0.7 generate code that is vulnerable to command injection."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running Nokogiri, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "The primary attack vector is through passing untrusted user input to the `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` method, which is an undocumented method within the Nokogiri library. This input is then used in a `Kernel.open` call, which results in the execution of arbitrary system commands."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to control the input passed to `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file`. The attacker does not need any special privileges.",
