Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `read_kmem` function of the grsecurity PaX patch for Linux.
- A `temp` buffer is allocated within `read_kmem` but is not freed if an invalid address is supplied during a read operation.
- This results in a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak due to the failure to free the allocated `temp` buffer when `read_kmem` returns early due to an invalid address.
- **Improper Release of Memory:** Specifically, the vulnerability is classified as CWE-401 (Improper Release of Memory Before Removing Last Reference).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** Repeatedly triggering the memory leak by inducing reads to `/dev/kmem` with invalid addresses can lead to memory exhaustion and eventually crash the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the system.
- **`/dev/kmem` Access:** The vulnerability requires interaction with the `/dev/kmem` device.
- **Invalid Address Read:** The attacker must induce the system to read `/dev/kmem` using an invalid address. This can be done by triggering a function or application that accesses /dev/kmem and uses an invalid memory address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- **`/dev/kmem` Access:**
    - `/dev/kmem` must be enabled (CONFIG_DEVKMEM). This is often disabled on mainstream distributions but may be present on some less common systems.
    - Either the attacker must be root or be a user in the kmem group with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.
- **Trigger of Read on Invalid Address:** The attacker needs to trigger a read of `/dev/kmem` with an invalid address. This is often achieved through SUID binaries or binaries with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

- The vulnerability was found in multiple versions of PaX and grsecurity.
- The vulnerability requires both `/dev/kmem` being enabled and the user having the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability or being root.
- The provided exploit PoC uses the `mount` utility with SUID to access `/dev/kmem`, triggering the vulnerability.
- The `CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_KMEM` option in grsecurity can protect against this by disabling `/dev/kmem` but is not enabled by default and is not a fix to the underlying vulnerability.
