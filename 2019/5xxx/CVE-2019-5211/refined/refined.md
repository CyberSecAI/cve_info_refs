- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper file management during file transfer using Huawei Share. Specifically, files are not properly processed, leading to deletion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper file handling when transferring files through Huawei Share.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a victim into performing specific actions during a file transfer, leading to the deletion of certain files on the victim's smartphone.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to initiate a file transfer and then trick the victim into performing a specific action on the phone during that transfer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to initiate a file transfer with a vulnerable device and be able to trick the victim into interacting with the device during the transfer. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
