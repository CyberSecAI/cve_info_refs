VMware Tools is a set of services and components that enable several features in various VMware products for better management and seamless user interactions with guest operating systems.

[VMware Tools Lifecycle Management](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tools/11.3.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vmwaretools.doc/GUID-14778D23-93A2-42F5-8F23-E19636827762.html) provides a simplified and scalable approach for installation and upgrade of VMware Tools. It includes a number of feature enhancements, driver-related enhancements, and support for new guest operating systems.

[Open VM Tools (open-vm-tools)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tools/11.3.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vmwaretools.doc/GUID-8B6EA5B7-453B-48AA-92E5-DB7F061341D1.html) is the open source implementation of VMware Tools for Linux guest operating systems. For the latest copy of the Open VM Tools source code, see [GitHub](https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools).

For vSphere deployments, VMware provides operating system specific packages (OSPs) as a packaging and distribution mechanism for VMware Tools. For more information, see [VMware Operating System Specific Packages](https://www.vmware.com/download/packages.html).
