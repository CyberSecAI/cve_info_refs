Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-5997

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a code injection vulnerability (CWE-94) in Panasonic Video Insight VMS. This likely means that the application is processing untrusted input in a way that allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Code Injection (CWE-94)
- Improper handling of input leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable Video Insight VMS. This could lead to complete system compromise, including:
  - Confidentiality breach (access to sensitive data, including video feeds)
  - Integrity compromise (modification of system configuration or video data)
  - Availability impact (denial of service or system shutdown)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable VMS over the network.
- No authentication or user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Video Insight VMS versions prior to 7.6.1.
- The initial advisory incorrectly stated the affected versions as 7.5 and earlier, and it was later found that 7.6 was also vulnerable, necessitating the 7.6.1 update.
- The CVSS v3 score is 9.8, indicating a critical vulnerability. The CVSS v2 score is 7.5, also high.
- The issue was reported to JPCERT/CC by Panasonic.
- The patch for this vulnerability was included in the 7.6.1 release.
- The release notes for 7.6.1 mention a "Web Client security vulnerability", which likely is this same issue.
