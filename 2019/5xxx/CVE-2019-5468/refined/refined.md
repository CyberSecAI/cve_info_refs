The provided content relates to CVE-2019-5468.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an authorization issue where GitLab fails to properly revoke access for blocked users when they interact with the system through Mattermost slash commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inconsistent user revocation: When a user is blocked in GitLab, their access via the API and web GUI is immediately revoked. However, their Mattermost session and related slash command access remain active, effectively bypassing the intended block.
- Lack of session invalidation: GitLab does not invalidate existing Mattermost sessions when a user is blocked. This allows blocked users to continue executing slash commands, as long as their session remains active (reportedly for up to 30 days).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Bypassed user block: A blocked user can continue to access and interact with GitLab resources through Mattermost slash commands. This includes accessing issues and potentially executing deployment commands.
- Information disclosure: Blocked users may be able to access sensitive project information like confidential issues.
- Continued access to resources: Even when explicitly blocked, a user can potentially continue to modify or execute commands on projects they previously had access to.

**Attack vectors:**
- Mattermost slash commands: The primary attack vector is through the Mattermost slash command integration with GitLab.
- GitLab SSO integration: The vulnerability requires the use of GitLab SSO with Mattermost.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have been a user with access to a project prior to being blocked
- The attacker needs to have an active Mattermost session linked to GitLab via SSO.
- The attacker needs to know the slash commands for the project

**More detail than the official CVE description:**
The content provides a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) setup and steps for reproducing the vulnerability, including screenshots and specific commands. It also explains the impact more thoroughly than a typical CVE description, including the ability for the blocked user to view confidential issues and potentially execute other commands. It also specifies the vulnerability exists in GitLab CE/EE 8.14 command service and later.
