# Blocked user bypass with Mattermost slash command integration

**[HackerOne report #493562](https://hackerone.com/reports/493562)** by `j-jam` on 2019-02-10, assigned to `estrike`:

## Summary

When GitLab is integrated with Mattermost slash commands and using GitLab SSO, the application correctly handles changes in repository membership, e.g. removal from private repo means you can no longer run any slash commands such as viewing or moving issues.

Within GitLab, when a user account is blocked, that particular user can instantly no longer use any API tokens or the web gui to access any repo content. However, it appears a blocked user can still execute Mattermost slash commands on any repos they had access to as long as the Mattermost session is still active (30 days I believe)

## PoC setup

Local GitLab install, latest version

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS x64

Testuser1 - victim user

Testuser2 - attacker

Private project setup called **testuser1-secret** with user **testuser2** added as developer.

## PoC

-As the root user, enable the Mattermost service using the below instructions:

<https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/gitlab-mattermost/>

-As **testuser1**, add **testuser2** as a developer on the **testuser1-secret** project

[![image1-testuser2access.PNG](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/0f7055ab47afeb3e4ef05f890950d93b1d3fa876/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439333536322f3432313336342f696d616765312d7465737475736572326163636573732e504e47)

-As **testuser1**, enable Mattermost slash commands for the **testuser1-secret** project

[![image2-slashcommands.PNG](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/3d055b9ae3ad1013ccbb15629b5f95891a81c8bb/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439333536322f3432313336352f696d616765322d736c617368636f6d6d616e64732e504e47)

-Login to Mattermost as **testuser1**, create a team with **testuser2** as a member and integrate the team with the **testuser1-secret** project using the below instructions:

<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/mattermost_slash_commands.html>

-Within a new browser session, log into Mattermost as **testuser2** using the GitLab SSO option and execute a slash command on the **testuser1-secret** project. In this case, the command keyword is **helloworld**. The command ran is to view a confidential issue

**Note.** You will be prompted by GitLab at some point to add Mattermost as a chat client

```
/helloworld issue show 11
```

[![image3-showissue.PNG](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/6b8662bd324a80f422798038457a54320f9ce862/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439333536322f3432313336312f696d616765332d73686f7769737375652e504e47)

-Login as the root user, block **testuser2** from GitLab. This will prevent API and web GUI access to GitLab

[![image4-blockeduser.PNG](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/2cd83816c9c87ae1d6e442242fdb09d41d706266/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439333536322f3432313336302f696d616765342d626c6f636b6564757365722e504e47)

[![image5-blockeduser.PNG](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/a626ee7fe46eaa8909c0339c18bcd6c681a832c4/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439333536322f3432313336332f696d616765352d626c6f636b6564757365722e504e47)

-Within the Mattermost session earlier as **testuser2**, attempt to execute more slash commands on the same project. You will see that the commands still work

```
/helloworld issue show 12
```

[![image6-issueaccess.PNG](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/756e2233992d53133b080b3ffa59b600d0ee70ad/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439333536322f3432313336322f696d616765362d69737375656163636573732e504e47)

**Note.** The above issue was added after testuser2 was blocked from GitLab

## Impact

This appears to be a bypass of the intended user block functionality within GitLab. A blocked user has no ability to use the API/Web GUI but Mattermost slash commands still provide access to issues and deployment commands. This is dependent on the blocker user's repo access and permission level to begin with though.
