  "CVE-2019-5666": {
    "Description": "NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) create context command DDI `DxgkDdiCreateContext` in which the product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges.",
    "Root cause": "The driver uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index within the `DxgkDdiCreateContext` DDI function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of array index from untrusted input"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service or escalation of privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker with local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted input to the vulnerable DDI function."
