- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper loading of a DLL file by Huawei HiSuite software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL hijacking vulnerability. The software loads DLL files in an insecure manner, allowing an attacker to load a malicious DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious DLL file.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with local access to a Windows system can place a malicious DLL in a location where HiSuite will load it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to log into the target Windows system.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL file in a location where it will be loaded by HiSuite.
