The provided content describes multiple command injection vulnerabilities in the WAGO PFC200 iocheckd service, and CVE-2019-5171 is one of them.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `iocheckd` service uses a file-backed cache (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`) for network configuration. During the parsing of this XML file, specific parameters such as `ip` are extracted and used in a `sprintf` command to format a string that is passed to the `system()` call, thus leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs OS commands using user-controlled data from the XML cache file without proper sanitization.
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The cache file `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` is globally writable, allowing any user to write to it.
- The parsing process iterates through all the node elements without limit, making it prone to denial-of-service attacks if the malicious file is extremely large.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands that will be executed with root privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Because any user can write the malicious XML file, and the commands are executed as root, this leads to privilege escalation.
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially take control of the device and cause disruption of control systems, or use the device as a foothold into other systems within the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XML File:** The attacker must create a malicious XML file (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`) containing the command injection payload within specific nodes.
- **Network Trigger:** The attacker then sends a `BC_SaveParameter` message that will trigger the parsing of the crafted XML file

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access (or any user):** The attacker needs the ability to write the malicious XML file to `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`, which is world-writable, so any user can do it.
- **Network Access (to send crafted BC_SaveParameter message):** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the device, triggering the parsing of the cache file and execution of the injected command via the vulnerable `iocheckd` service.

**Specific details for CVE-2019-5171:**

- The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `<ip>` node within the `<interfaces><X1>` XML structure of the `iocheckCache.xml` file.
- The extracted IP value is used as an argument to `/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=X1 state=enabled ip-address=<contents of ip node>` using `sprintf()`. This command is later executed via a call to `system()`.
- Example malicious XML structure for CVE-2019-5171:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
<network>
    <interfaces>
    <X1>
        <ip>192.168.1.30; echo $(whoami) > /tmp/iocheckcache_ip_command_injection</ip>
    </X1>
    </interfaces>
</network>
</settings>
```
The report also provides mitigation strategies such as disabling the iocheckd service or disabling iocheckd caching. The provided Python script can be used to disable the caching.
