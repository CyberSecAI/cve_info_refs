Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-5674:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of hard links when ShadowPlay or GameStream is enabled in NVIDIA GeForce Experience. The software doesn't check for hard link attacks.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Hard Link Vulnerability:** The software does not validate hard links, allowing an attacker to manipulate them. This can potentially lead to the software accessing or executing files it should not.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Exploiting this could lead to privilege escalation because the attacker is able to manipulate files and execute code with potentially higher privileges.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting the hard link vulnerability.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be used to cause a denial-of-service condition, making the system unavailable.
    *   **Escalation of Privileges:** Attackers might escalate their privileges, gaining more control over the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where GeForce Experience is installed.
    *   **Hard Link Creation:** The attacker must be able to create hard links on the system.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User:** A local user account on the target machine is needed.
    *   **Ability to create hard links:** The attacker needs to be able to create hard links on the system's file system.
    *   **ShadowPlay or GameStream enabled:** The vulnerability is present when ShadowPlay or GameStream features are enabled in GeForce Experience.

**Summary of CVSS V3 Vector:**

*   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is relatively easy to perform.
*   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** A low-privileged user can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required for exploitation.
*   **S:C (Scope: Changed):** The vulnerability can affect other components of the system beyond the vulnerable software itself.
*   **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** Exploitation can lead to a high impact on confidentiality.
*   **I:H (Integrity Impact: High):** Exploitation can lead to a high impact on system integrity.
*  **A:H (Availability Impact: High):** Exploitation can lead to a high impact on system availability.
