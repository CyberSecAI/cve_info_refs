Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The CREATE SD official App for Android has an improper access control vulnerability in how it handles Intents. The app uses an Intent to access a requested URL, but it does not properly restrict which applications can send these Intents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the lack of proper access control when handling Intents. The app does not verify the source of the Intent, allowing any application to send malicious URLs via an Intent.
- Specifically, the app doesn't restrict access permissions on the function that accesses URLs using Intents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** A remote attacker can craft a malicious Intent and send it to the vulnerable application. The app will then load the arbitrary URL, which could be a phishing site disguised as a legitimate one. The user may be tricked into entering their credentials or personal information on this malicious site.
- **Arbitrary Website Access:**  An attacker can force the app to open an arbitrary website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Intent Spoofing:** The attack vector is through a malicious app sending a crafted intent to the vulnerable application.
- **Local Attack:** Since the attack involves two apps on the same device, the attack is local. However the attacker is "remote" in the sense they are not the user and can trigger the vulnerability remotely via the malicious app.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to create and install a malicious application on the user's Android device.
- **No User Privilege Required:** The attacker's malicious application does not need any special privileges to send the crafted intent.
- **User Interaction:** The user must have the vulnerable application installed, and they are required to have a malicious app installed on the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions 1.0.2 and earlier of the app.
- The fix is to update the application to version 1.0.3 or later, where this vulnerability has been addressed.
- The JVN database entry states that this analysis assumes that the user has installed an application which is created to use/operate the vulnerable App.
- The CVSS v3 score is 3.3 (Low) and CVSS v2 score is 2.6(Low).
