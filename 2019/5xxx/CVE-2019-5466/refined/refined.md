Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5466:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the new merge request endpoint. Specifically, the application doesn't properly validate user authorization when accessing label names via their IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The application allows users to access label information by directly referencing their IDs in the URL parameters, without proper authorization checks.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability exposes label names, including those belonging to private projects, to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can enumerate all label names in a GitLab instance, regardless of project visibility settings. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within labels, such as project details, issue categories, or other metadata.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL with the `merge_request[label_ids][]` parameter.
- The attacker must be a project member with the capability to create merge requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a project member who has permissions to create merge requests within a project.
- They need to be able to craft a specific URL for a new merge request including the `merge_request[label_ids][]` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by `ashish_r_padelkar`.
- It affects GitLab CE/EE versions 11.5 and later.
- The vulnerability is mitigated in the released versions 12.1.2, 12.0.4, and 11.11.7
- The vulnerability was fixed by introducing proper authorization checks to restrict access to label information through the merge request endpoint.
