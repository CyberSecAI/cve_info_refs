The content is related to CVE-2019-5148.

Summary:
An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the ServiceAgent functionality of the Moxa AWK-3131A, firmware version 1.13. A specially crafted packet can cause an integer underflow, triggering a large memcpy that will access unmapped or out-of-bounds memory, leading to a crash of the ServiceAgent binary.

Vulnerability Details:
- Vulnerability: Integer underflow leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- Root Cause: The `parseRecvData` function processes ServiceAgent bundles. It calculates the length of the data to copy from the packet without validating the total packet length. This leads to an integer underflow when calculating the length of the copy, resulting in a very large value.
- Weakness: Lack of proper input validation on the length of the ServiceAgent bundle within the received packet.
- Attack vector: Sending a specially crafted packet to the ServiceAgent.
- Impact: Denial of service due to the ServiceAgent binary crashing, caused by out-of-bounds memory access during a `memcpy` operation. This out-of-bounds access manifests as either a SIGSEGV (out-of-bounds access) or a SIGBUS (unmapped memory).
- Required attacker capabilities: An attacker can send this malicious packet unauthenticated to trigger the vulnerability.

Affected product:
- Moxa AWK-3131A
- Firmware version 1.13

CWE:
CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
