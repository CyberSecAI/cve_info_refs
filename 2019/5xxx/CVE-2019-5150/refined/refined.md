Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `getVideo` function within `/objects/video.php` of the YouPHPTube application. This occurs because user-supplied input from the `$_GET['search']` parameter is not sanitized before being incorporated into an SQL query when the "VideoTags" plugin is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the direct injection of user-controlled data (specifically `$_POST['searchPhrase']`, which originates from `$_GET['search']`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. The vulnerable code snippet is: `$sql .= "v.id IN (select videos_id FROM tags_has_videos LEFT JOIN tags as t ON tags_id = t.id AND t.name LIKE '%{$_POST['searchPhrase']}%' WHERE t.id is NOT NULL)";`
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The vulnerability also leads to Local File Inclusion, because the `vType` variable extracted from the vulnerable SQL query result is later used in a `require` statement without sufficient validation: `require "{$global['systemRootPath']}view/include/{$vType}.php";`. By manipulating the SQL injection, an attacker can control the `vType` and include any local PHP file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could craft a malicious SQL query that overloads the database server, causing it to become unresponsive.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The SQL injection could be exploited to extract sensitive data from the database, including user information, video details, and other application data.
*  **Local File Inclusion:** The attacker can cause the server to include arbitrary local php files, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including arbitrary php files with malicious code, an attacker could gain full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/index.php` endpoint with a malicious `search` parameter in the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable YouPHPTube application.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **VideoTags Plugin Enabled:** The "VideoTags" plugin must be enabled in the YouPHPTube instance for the SQL injection vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code to cause an error by trying to include a non-existent file, demonstrating SQL injection and LFI.
* The `getVideo` function is reachable by unauthenticated users requesting the `/index.php` page.
* The vulnerability was patched by the vendor after the initial disclosure.
