Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization checks when handling badge requests for GitLab CI build and coverage statuses. The system fails to properly verify if the user requesting the badge has the necessary permissions to view pipeline information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control on the endpoints that serve build and coverage status badges. These endpoints do not enforce the same pipeline access restrictions that apply to the full pipeline view.
- **Information Leakage:**  The system leaks information about the build and coverage status of branches to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can access the build and coverage status of various branches, even when they are explicitly restricted from accessing pipeline details. This allows them to gain insights into the project's development process, code quality, and testing status, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Circumvention of Access Restrictions:** The vulnerability undermines the configured visibility and access restrictions on projects and their pipelines.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly access the badge SVG endpoints by crafting URLs for specific projects and branches. This can be done anonymously for public projects or with guest access to private projects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Public Projects (with restricted pipeline access):** No authentication is needed, anyone can access the status.
- **Internal Projects (with restricted pipeline access):** Any authenticated user can access the information.
- **Private Projects:** A guest user role on the private project is sufficient to access the badge information, even without pipeline access.
