Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-5078

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authentication for a critical function within the `iocheckd` service's "I/O-Check" functionality on WAGO PFC200 devices. This lack of authentication allows an attacker to send specially crafted packets that can erase system data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication for the "I/O-Check" functionality, allowing unauthenticated access to critical operations.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition where the device enters an error state, ceases all network communications and requires physical access and knowledge of bootloader internal system data to recover.
- **Data Erasure:** An attacker can erase system data via the vulnerable function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The most significant impact is a denial of service, rendering the WAGO PFC200 device inoperable. It stops responding and communicating over the network.
- **Loss of Control:** The device is rendered uncontrollable remotely.
- **Physical Recovery Required:** Recovery necessitates physical access to the device and expertise to use the bootloader, causing downtime and manual intervention.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending unauthenticated, specially crafted packets over the network.
- **iocheckd Protocol:** The specific attack vector is through the iocheckd protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WAGO PFC200 device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any authentication to send the malicious packets.
- **Knowledge of iocheckd Protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to construct packets according to the iocheckd protocol.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects WAGO PFC200 and PFC100 devices with specific firmware versions (03.01.07(13), 03.00.39(12)).
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).
- Mitigation involves disabling the iocheckd service via the device's web-based management application.
