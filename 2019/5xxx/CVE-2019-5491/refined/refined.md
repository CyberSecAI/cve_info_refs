Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-5491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Clustered Data ONTAP handles network buffers, specifically related to SMB communication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper handling of previous network buffer usage.
- This allows the disclosure of data from prior communications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can potentially gain access to 6 bytes of sensitive information from previous network buffer usage.
- This information disclosure vulnerability could expose sensitive data that may have been processed in previous network operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through SMB (Server Message Block) communication with the affected system.
- The attacker needs to establish a network connection to the vulnerable system utilizing SMB.
- Exploitation is possible over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication.
- A network position that allows communication with the vulnerable Clustered Data ONTAP instance via SMB is required.

**Additional Details:**
- NetApp is aware of public discussions related to this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as "MEDIUM" severity with a CVSS score of 5.3, categorized as a network attack with low attack complexity, no required privileges, no user interaction and no impact to integrity or availability.
- A workaround of disabling SMB encryption is suggested.
- The vulnerability affects Clustered Data ONTAP versions prior to 9.1P15 and 9.3P7, along with all versions of 9.2.
- Fixes are available in Clustered Data ONTAP 9.1P15, 9.3P7, and later versions.
