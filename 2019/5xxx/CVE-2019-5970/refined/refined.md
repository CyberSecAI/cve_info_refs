Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5970:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the "Attendance Manager" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored in the database. These scripts are executed when a user, particularly one with administrative privileges, views the affected content within the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the web browser of a user with administrative privileges.
-   **Potential for Account Takeover:** This can lead to session hijacking, account compromise, and further malicious actions by the attacker, such as modifying data or redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a user with administrative privileges to view the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's data, which is stored in the WordPress database. This may involve finding a user input point that is not properly sanitized.
-   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
-   The attacker needs to entice a user with admin privileges to visit a page with the malicious payload.

**Additional Details**
- The plugin versions affected are 0.5.6 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was reported by Natsumi Matsuoka of Cryptography Laboratory,Department of Information and Communication Engineering,Tokyo Denki University.
