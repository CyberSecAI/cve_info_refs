The provided content is a Talos Intelligence vulnerability report for CVE-2019-5090.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check between the declared packet size and the declared file size within the `LDicomFile::Write` function. This allows for a buffer overflow due to out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `LDicomFile::Write` function due to insufficient size validation.
- The `memcpy` function in `LDicomFile::Write` uses an attacker controlled size leading to the out of bounds read.
- The `LDicomNet::Receive` function does not validate the declared file size against the packet size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can read arbitrary data from memory, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- Denial of Service: The out-of-bounds read can potentially lead to a crash due to reading unmapped memory.
- Possible arbitrary code execution if the out of bounds data is controllable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted DICOM packet to the vulnerable server. The packet contains a declared file size that exceeds the actual packet size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to a service that uses the vulnerable LEADTOOLS library, specifically the DICOM networking functionality.
- No authentication is needed.
