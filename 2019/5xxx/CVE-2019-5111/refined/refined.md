- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `filter_cat` and `filter_status` parameters of the `/appLms/ajax.server.php` endpoint, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially exfiltrate database content, including user credentials, and in certain configurations, gain access to the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `/appLms/ajax.server.php` endpoint with malicious SQL code in the `filter_cat` or `filter_status` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires an authenticated user with access to the vulnerable endpoint.
