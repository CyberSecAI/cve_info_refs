  "CVE-2019-5624": {
    "Description": "Rapid7 Metasploit Framework suffers from an instance of CWE-22, Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in the Zip import function of Metasploit. Exploiting this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in Metasploit at the privilege level of the user running Metasploit. This issue affects: Rapid7 Metasploit Framework version 4.14.0 and prior versions.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of file paths within the zip import functionality of Metasploit Framework. Specifically, the `Entry#extract` function in the Rubyzip library, when called with a destination path provided by the user, does not perform adequate validation to prevent path traversal attacks. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious zip archive containing entries with manipulated paths, which can lead to arbitrary file write operations outside the intended directory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the Metasploit server, running with the privileges of the user running Metasploit. This can result in full compromise of the Metasploit instance and potentially the underlying system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious zip archive with path traversal payloads within the filenames. When this archive is imported into Metasploit, the framework extracts files to attacker-controlled paths due to the lack of proper path validation in the `Entry#extract` function.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to upload and import a crafted zip archive into a Metasploit instance. This typically requires some form of access to the Metasploit user interface, such as web interface access or a way to provide the malicious file to the db_import command.  The attacker needs to have low privileges required but user interaction is required."
