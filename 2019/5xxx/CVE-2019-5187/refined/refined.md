- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `TIF_read_stripdata` function of the `igcore19d.dll` library. The vulnerability occurs because the size of the destination buffer (`dstBuffer`) is calculated incorrectly when the "BitsPerSample" TIFF tag value is 1, leading to a buffer that is too small to contain the data being written, thus resulting in an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Out-of-bounds write in the `TIF_read_stripdata` function.
  - Incorrect buffer size calculation in `compute_size_based_imagewidth` when `getbitspersamplevalue` is equal to 1.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. The out-of-bounds write can overwrite critical data, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted TIFF file with specific tag values (compression set to 1, planar configuration set to 2) must be provided to the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed TIFF file to the vulnerable application. This could involve tricking a user into opening a malicious file or sending the file to a server that processes TIFF files.
