Such an attack may lead to code execution, denial of service or information disclosure. | 7.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5676 | NVIDIA GeForce Experience installer software contains a vulnerability in which it incorrectly loads Windows system DLLs without validating the path or signature (also known as a binary planting or DLL preloading attack), leading to escalation of privileges through code execution. The attacker requires local system access. | 7.2 | [AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
