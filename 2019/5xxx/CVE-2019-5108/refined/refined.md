{
  "CVE-2019-5108": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel sends IAPP location updates for stations before the required authentication process has completed.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The kernel sends a broadcast packet with the MAC address of a connecting station to the LAN before the station has successfully authenticated. This allows an attacker to trigger location updates by forging Authentication and Association Request packets.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial of service. This can be achieved either by flooding a switch with a large number of MAC addresses, filling its CAM table, or by causing traffic flapping by faking existing clients in nearby APs of the same wireless infrastructure.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker forges Authentication and Association Request packets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be within range of the affected access point."
