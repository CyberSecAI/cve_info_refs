  "baseScore": "7.8",
  "vector": "AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H",
  "summary": "NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in DirectX drivers, in which a specially crafted shader can cause an out of bounds access of an input texture array, which may lead to denial of service or code execution.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "An untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability exists in NVIDIA NVWGF2UMX_CFG driver. A specially crafted pixel shader can cause an untrusted pointer dereference due to an out of bounds access of an input texture array.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference",
        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation of the out-of-bounds write issue may lead to code execution on the host.  Successful exploitation of the out-of-bounds read issue may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on the host.",
      "attackVector": "A specially crafted pixel shader is supplied by the attacker via the VMware guest OS to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "attackerCapabilities": "Attacker needs to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled. It is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion. A local attacker with access to the guest OS can provide a specially crafted shader to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered from VMware guest, and will affect a VMware host.",
       "additonalDetails": "The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a malformed pixel shader (inside VMware guest OS). This attack can be triggered from VMware guest usermode to cause untrusted pointer dereference (potential memory corruption) on the `vmware-vmx.exe` process on the host or, theoretically, through WEBGL (remote website).\nBy modifying the shader instructions (shader bytecode), especially the operand (texture register) of `SAMPLE` instructions from previously declared `RESOURCE[5]` to a different `RESOURCE[X]` (in this case X=46), it is possible to trigger an arbitrary memory write (untrusted pointer dereference)."
