- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrectly applied patch in the `Dispatch` function of the Pixar Renderman Install Helper tool for Mac OS X. The patch was intended to restrict program execution to the system installer but failed to properly verify the caller, exposing the functionality to any user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of caller verification in the `Dispatch` function.
    - Exposed dangerous method or function (CWE-749).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can escalate their privileges to root and install arbitrary programs on the computer.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the machine is required. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by using the exposed `Dispatch` function to install a malicious package as root.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to a machine with the vulnerable version of Pixar Renderman installed. The attacker must be able to execute commands on the target system.
