CVE-2019-5127
Root cause: The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command.
Vulnerability: Command injection in the base64Url parameter of the /objects/getImage.php script.
Impact: Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to exfiltration of the database or user credentials, or complete compromise of the underlying operating system.
Attack vector: By sending a specially crafted web request to /objects/getImage.php with the base64Url parameter containing malicious code.
Required attacker capabilities: The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
