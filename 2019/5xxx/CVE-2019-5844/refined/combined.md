Tuesday, March 12, 2019

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 73 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. This will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Chrome 73.0.3683.75 contains a number of fixes and improvements -- a list of changes is available in the[log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/72.0.3626.121..73.0.3683.75?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Watch out for upcoming[Chrome](https://chrome.blogspot.com/) and[Chromium](https://blog.chromium.org/) blog posts about new features and big efforts delivered in 73.

**Security Fixes and Rewards**
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [60](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call+label%3ARelease-0-M73) security fixes.

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

* [[940992](https://crbug.com/940992)] Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

Interested in switching release channels? Find out how [here](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.

Thank you,
Abdul Syed
