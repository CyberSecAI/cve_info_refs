##### 3c. VMware vCenter Server information disclosure vulnerability- CVE-2019-5532

**Description:**

VMware vCenter Server contains an information disclosure vulnerability due to the logging of credentials in plain-text for virtual machines deployed through OVF. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).

**Known Attack Vectors:**

A malicious user with access to the log files containing vCenter OVF-properties of a virtual machine deployed from an OVF may be able to view the credentials used to deploy the OVF (typically the root account of the virtual machine).

**Resolution:**

To remediate CVE-2019-5532, update/upgrade to the versions listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Resolution Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds:**

If the password of the deployment account (typically root) is changed on the virtual machine after deployment of the OVF then the credentials stored in the vCenter OVF-properties will no longer be valid and cannot be used to access the virtual machine.

**Additional Documentations:**

None.

**Acknowledgements:**

VMware would like to thank Ola Beyioku for reporting this issue to us.

**Response Matrix:**

| Product | Version | Running On | CVE Identifier | CVSSV3 | Severity | Fixed Version | Workarounds | Additional Documents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vCenter | 6.7 | Any | CVE-2019-5532 | [7.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) | Important | 6.7 U3 | See above | None |

| vCenter | 6.0 | Any | CVE-2019-5532 | [7.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) | Important | 6.0 U3j | See above | None |

##### 3d. Information disclosure vulnerability in vAppConfig properties - CVE-2019-5534

**Description:**

Virtual Machines deployed from an OVF could expose login information via the virtual machine's vAppConfig properties. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Important severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [7.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N).

**Known Attack Vectors:**

A malicious actor with access to query the vAppConfig properties of a virtual machine deployed from an OVF may be able to view the credentials used to deploy the OVF (typically the root account of the virtual machine).

**Resolution:**

To mitigate CVE-2019-5534 upgrade to the versions listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Resolution Matrix' found below.

**Workarounds:**

The information stored in vAppConfig properties is captured at the time of deployment. If the password of the deployment account (typically root) is changed on the virtual machine after deployment of the OVF then the credentials stored in the vAppConfig properties will no longer be valid and cannot be used to access the virtual machine.

**Additional Documentations:**

None.

**Acknowledgements:**

VMware would like to thank Rich Browne of F5 Networks for reporting this issue to us.
