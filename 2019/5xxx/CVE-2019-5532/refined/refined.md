Vulnerability: VMware vCenter Server information disclosure vulnerability
CVE ID: CVE-2019-5532
Affected Product: VMware vCenter Server
Versions: 6.0, 6.5, 6.7
Root Cause: The vulnerability is due to the logging of credentials in plain text for virtual machines deployed through OVF (Open Virtualization Format).
Attack Vector: A malicious user with access to the log files containing vCenter OVF-properties of a virtual machine deployed from an OVF may be able to view the credentials used to deploy the OVF (typically the root account of the virtual machine).
Impact: Information Disclosure. An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to virtual machines by obtaining the plain-text credentials from the log files.
Severity: Important
CVSSv3 Base Score: 7.7
Workaround: Change the password of the deployment account (typically root) on the virtual machine after deployment of the OVF. This will invalidate the credentials stored in the vCenter OVF-properties.
Resolution: Update/upgrade to the versions listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix'.
