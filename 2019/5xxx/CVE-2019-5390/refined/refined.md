    "Description": "A remote command injection vulnerability was identified in HPE Intelligent Management Center (IMC) PLAT earlier than version 7.3 E0506P09.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation that allows remote command injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote command injection",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"

    "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service."

    "Description": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in HPE Intelligent Management Center (IMC) PLAT earlier than version 7.3 E0506P09.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in HPE Intelligent Management Center (IMC) PLAT.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
       "Insufficient input validation"

    "TRA-2019-42": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in HPE iMC 7.3 E0703",
        "Root cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities, including an unauthenticated remote denial of service (DoS), incomplete fixes for CVE-2019-5390 and CVE-2019-5391.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Unauthenticated remote DoS due to uncontrolled memory allocation",
             "Incomplete fixes for command injection and stack buffer overflow",
            "Stack buffer overflow",
            "Insufficient input validation",
            "Configuration injection"

        "Impact": "Denial of service and remote code execution.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Network"
        ],
        "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service. Additionally, the attacker can exploit the incomplete fixes by first injecting configuration variables, then causing a crash with the DoS vulnerability to force a restart, triggering the stack overflow with the injected configuration.",
         "Details": "The unauthenticated DoS is triggered by sending a crafted message to the dbman process, which results in a large memory allocation, leading to an exception and termination of the process. The incomplete fixes allow an attacker to inject configuration variables in dbman.conf by sending a specific command (10018), restart the process using the DoS vulnerability. When dbman restarts with the modified configuration, the stack buffer overflow occurs, leading to arbitrary code execution. The restart of the process is automated under imcsysdm.exe if the Intelligent Deployment Monitoring Agent has started."
