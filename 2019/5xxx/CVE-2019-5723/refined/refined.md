Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of a weak and outdated Vigenère cipher with a static, hardcoded, and short key to encrypt passwords. Instead of hashing, the application encrypts passwords, making them reversible if the encryption method is compromised.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of a weak encryption algorithm:** The Vigenère cipher is considered outdated and easily breakable, especially with a short key.
*   **Static Key:** The encryption key is hardcoded into the application, making it the same for all installations.
*  **Reversible Encryption:** Passwords are encrypted instead of hashed, allowing for decryption.
*   **Short Key Length:** The 15-byte static key makes the Vigenère cipher even easier to break.
*   **Lack of Proper Password Handling:** The application stores passwords in a reversible encrypted form instead of using strong hashing algorithms.
*   **Reused Key:** The same key is used to encrypt both user passwords and the database password, increasing the impact of key compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Decryption:** An attacker can decrypt user passwords stored in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Decrypting user passwords can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges within the application.
*   **Database Compromise:** The same key used to encrypt user passwords is also used for the database password found in the `portiervision.ini` configuration file. This can allow an attacker to gain access to the database, potentially leading to further compromise of other systems by using the database credentials on other systems within the corporate network.
*   **Potential Lateral Movement:** With access to the database credentials, attackers might be able to use them to access other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Encrypted Passwords:** An attacker needs access to the encrypted password data stored by the application (likely the database). This could be achieved through various means, including compromising the machine or network where the application is located, a SQL injection or by gaining access to the database file.
*   **Static Key Extraction:** The attacker needs to extract the static encryption key. Since it is hardcoded, this could be achieved by reverse engineering the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access either the application's database or the configuration file where the encrypted passwords are stored.
*   The attacker needs to have the technical skills to reverse engineer the application to extract the hardcoded key, or use the known key if made public.
*   The attacker needs the ability to use the provided python script or similar means to decrypt the passwords.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory provides a detailed explanation of how the vulnerability can be exploited, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) analysis of sample password pairs, the static key derivation, and a Python script for decryption.
*   The advisory strongly recommends storing passwords as a hash value using a suitable cryptographic hashing algorithm like PBKDF2 or bcrypt.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was notified but as of the public disclosure date, no solution had been provided.
