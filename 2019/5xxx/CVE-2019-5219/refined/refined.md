- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A double free vulnerability exists in a specific driver of Huawei smartphones. This occurs when multiple processes attempt to operate on the same resource concurrently, leading to a situation where the same memory is freed twice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick the user into installing a malicious application. Once installed, the malicious app initiates multiple processes that interact with the vulnerable resource simultaneously to trigger the double free condition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious application and convince a user to install it on their Huawei smartphone. The attacker requires no special privileges or access to the phone, other than what the application receives upon installation.
