The FreeBSD Project
Topic: ICMP/ICMP6 packet filter bypass in pf
Category: contrib
Module: pf
Announced: 2019-05-14
Credits: Synacktiv
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD
Corrected: 2019-03-21 14:17:10 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
2019-05-14 23:12:22 UTC (releng/12.0, 12.0-RELEASE-p4)
2019-03-21 14:17:12 UTC (stable/11, 11.3-PRERELEASE)
2019-05-14 23:12:22 UTC (releng/11.2, 11.2-RELEASE-p10)
CVE Name: CVE-2019-5598
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
pf(4) is an Internet Protocol packet filter originally written for OpenBSD.
In addition to filtering packets, it also has packet normalization
capabilities.
II. Problem Description
States in pf(4) let ICMP and ICMP6 packets pass if they have a packet in
their payload matching an existing condition. pf(4) does not check if the
outer ICMP or ICMP6 packet has the same destination IP as the source IP of
the inner protocol packet.
III. Impact
A maliciously crafted ICMP/ICMP6 packet could bypass the packet filter rules
and be passed to a host that would otherwise be unavailable.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Afterwards, reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Afterwards, reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:06/pf.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:06/pf.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pf.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.

# icmp-reachable

A strange behavior was observed by Synacktiv experts during the security assessment of a stateful firewall implementation... After few coffees & RFCs it was understood that it could be a generic issue that might affect multiple IP stacks. So... What is a strange firewall behavior ?

This article presents an implicit behavior of Linux nftables and OpenBSD PacketFilter? regarding the filtering of ICMP and ICMPv6 packets we considered as a security issue. It allows an attacker to bypass filtering rules in some cases and send ICMP or ICMPv6 packets to a host behind a firewall.

**Disclaimer 1**: We initially thought that the described attack was new. After writing the article we discovered that a similar technique was considered by Fernando Gont[1](icmp-reachable#footnote1_j22x726 "Filtering of ICMP error messages")Â in 2004. However, we do not think that its application to Packet Filter and nftables was identified at the time so here is the article.

## ICMP and ICMPv6

ICMP and ICMPv6 are the main support protocols for Internet. Those protocols are designed for connectivity testing and error signaling when a packet does not reach its destination. Receiving an ICMP message let an application understand the reason of a failure: packet too big, no route available, etc.

### ICMP messages

For their different purposes, ICMP[v6] messages are identified by two values encoded as two bytes: their *type* and their *code*. Each *type* has a different meaning, for instance, ICMP have the following messages:

* Echo Reply and Request (type 1 and 8)
* Destination Unreachable (type 3)
* Source quench (type 4)
* Timestamp Reply and Request (type 14 and 15)
* ...

When ICMPv6 have:

* Destination Unreachable (type 1);
* Packet Too Big (type 2);
* Time exceeded (type 3);
* Parameter problem (type 4);
* Router Solicitation and Advertisement (type 133 and 134);
* Neighbor Solicitation and Advertisement (type 135 and 136).
* ...

Various messages types have been deprecated in the past while others are still in use. We can approximately sort the ICMP messages into three categories depending on their purpose:

* **requests**: they are generated by a host to query some information;
* **reply**: they are the ICMP responses of the said ICMP requests;
* **errors**: they are created by a network equipment or host when they cannot handle a packet.

This article focus on the error messages. This category is quite interesting because its messages are sent as out-of-band traffic in reaction to a layer 4 communication of another protocol.

For instance, an UDP packet may generate an ICMP error. Those errors often encapsulate within the ICMP payload, the IP header plus the next 64 bytes of the offending packet. Figure 1 shows this behavior with a host B refusing a packet on a closed port:

![out_of_band_icmp](../../sites/default/files/inline-images/out_of_band_icmp.png)

Figure 1: An example of an out-of-band ICMP error

### Known attacks and mitigation

As a signaling protocol, ICMP messages can change the behavior of the IP stack of a receiving system. For instance, ICMP Redirect and ICMPv6 Router advertisement can alter the routing table of a host.

Malicious users can abuse ICMP to disrupt networking operations. Various attacks related to ICMP have been documented in the past:

* ICMP [hole punching](http://samy.pl/pwnat/)Â is the concept of traversing NAT with the help of ICMP messages. It requires the initiator to be behind the NAT;
* ICMP [tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_tunnel)Â is an abuse of the ICMP protocol to encapsulate arbitrary data on top of ICMP messages;
* ICMP [ECHO amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smurf_attack)Â using broadcast to perform DoS;
* Network traffic may be slowed down by attacking the MTU discovery process or the packet congestion[2](icmp-reachable#footnote2_1x46baw "draft-roca-ipsecme-ptb-pts-attack-00")[3](icmp-reachable#footnote3_8huyeye "rfc5927")[4](icmp-reachable#footnote4_6u301t7 "rfc6633") signaling.
* ICMPv6 [5](icmp-reachable#footnote5_qlbcsil "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3756")Â (similar to ARP attacks in IPv4 world);
* ICMPv6 [MLD discovery + DoS](https://www.ernw.de/download/DeepSec2014_Atlasis_Rey_Salazar_MLD_Considered_Harmful.pdf)Â (similar to IGMP attacks).

Most of these risks can be mitigated by properly configuring the IP stack of the operating system. What is interesting is that one can enable various ICMP protections without using the operating system firewall features (ex: sysctl, netsh, ...).

Example using sysctl on Linux:

```

# sysctl -a -r '^net\.ipv[46]\.(icmp|conf\.default\.accept)' | cut -d= -f1
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_local
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
net.ipv4.icmp_errors_use_inbound_ifaddr
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses
net.ipv4.icmp_msgs_burst
net.ipv4.icmp_msgs_per_sec
net.ipv4.icmp_ratelimit
net.ipv4.icmp_ratemask
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_dad
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra_defrtr
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra_from_local
...
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route
net.ipv6.icmp.ratelimit
```

In an ideal world, dangerous ICMP messages should be blocked by the IP stack of each host without the need of a firewall. In reality the security hardening is often implemented by a firewall in-between a WAN and a restricted LAN. And here comes the question: how ICMP and ICMPv6 should be filtered ?

## How ICMP should be filtered ?

### What the RFC recommends

When it comes to filtering the ICMP messages, blocking all messages types is a bad idea. It will reduces the overall user experience or worst. For instance, blocking "packet too big" can in fact completely prevent IPv6 to work and may seriously degrade the performances of IPv4.

The [RFC4890](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4890)Â (2007) says to allow ICMPv6 error messages in chapter *4.3.1. Traffic That Must Not Be Dropped*:

```

Error messages that are essential to the establishment and
maintenance of communications:

-  Destination Unreachable (Type 1) - All codes
-  Packet Too Big (Type 2)
-  Time Exceeded (Type 3) - Code 0 only
-  Parameter Problem (Type 4) - Codes 1 and 2 only
```

The (expired) draft ["Recommendations for filtering ICMP messages"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-opsec-icmp-filtering-04)Â (2013), provides two tables that summarize which ICMP and ICMPv6 messages should be accepted, rate-limited or refused when a device acts as a gateway or a firewall. The draft recommends allowing (accept or rate-limit) the following messages:

* ICMPv4-unreach-(net|host|frag-needed|admin);
* ICMPv4-timed-(ttl|reass);
* ICMPv6-unreach-(no-route|admin-prohibited|addr|port|reject-route);
* ICMPv6-too-big;
* ICMPv6-timed-(hop-limit|reass);
* ICMPv6-parameter-unrec-option;
* ICMPv6-err-expansion.

It seems people tend to have different opinions regarding what is safe ICMP traffic. It is usually accepted that a firewall should block all inbound ICMP and ICMPv6 packets (except NDP) from a WAN, unless they are related to a *known existing connection*, which can be tracked by stateful firewalls.

### Stateful firewalls and related traffic

In fact, stateful firewalls implement the concept of *related* packets. These *related* packets are the ones matching the out-of-band traffic attached to existing connections. The *related* notion is used with ICMP but also with other protocols such as FTP that may use a secondary TCP stream.

Concerning ICMP, the association between in-band and out-of-band traffic is done by extracting a "state identifier" from the IP packet encapsulated in the ICMP error message. This identifier is used to lookup in a table if the connection is known.

To illustrate this concept, let's consider the following example. In a simple network, we want to only allow the hosts on a LAN, to contact any hosts on the WAN with UDP on the port 1234. But we still want A to receive out-of-band errors. In this situation, the following high-level firewall configuration would be used:

1. allow input from LAN to WAN udp port 1234;
2. allow input from WAN to LAN if packet is *related* to an existing allowed connection;
3. block all.

The outgoing in-band UDP traffic would match rule 1. The ingoing out-of-band ICMP error messages would match rule 2, as seen in the Figure 2, and any other packet would by denied by rule 3.

![oob_packet_inspection](../../sites/default/files/inline-images/oob_packet_inspection.png)

Figure 2: the stateful filtering of an ICMP error by extracting the inner layer

In reality the semantics of the firewalls configuration differ and the rule 2 may be implicit in some implementations.

### What is a connection state ?

So far we know that stateful firewalls extrapolate a state from ICMP (or ICMPv6) errors. But the remaining question is what pieces of information are in fact extracted from the inner IP packet ?

Since layer 4 protocols have different semantics, each protocol has its own extractor, but we observed the following in Packet Filter and nftables derivatives:

For **TCP** the following fields are used to construct the state:

* The inner IP source and destination;
* The inner source and destination ports;
* The SEQ and ACK fields are only used in Packet Filter but not in nftables.

For **UDP** the following fields are used to construct the state:

* The inner IP source and destination;
* The inner source and destination ports.

For **ICMP** the following fields are used to construct the state:

* The inner IP source and destination;
* Various ICMP fields depending on the type.

For **other protocols**:

* The inner IP source and destination;
* The id of the protocol;
* Properties provided by the protocols (ex: SCTP or UDP-Lite ports) will be used if the firewall supports them (nftables can, Packet Filter can not).

### Quick recap

To sum up, when the firewall receives an out-of-band ICMP error it does the following:

1. Decodes the IP/ICMP or IPv6/ICMPv6 headers;
2. Extracts the state from the encapsulated IP or IPv6 packet;
3. Tries to match the "state identifier" in a list of existing states;
4. If the inner IP packet state matches an existing state, the packet is marked as *related*.

## icmp-reachable

### The issue

We discovered that when the inner packet is extracted to find a state, the correlation with the outer packet is lost. This means that, as long as the encapsulated packet can be related to an existing connection, the whole packet is tagged as related. Then, this packet will be allowed to pass in most situations.

This behavior can be abused with a maliciously crafted ICMP[v6] packet that targets a filtered host, while encapsulating a packet matching a legitimate state as shown in the following:

```

ICMP-Reachable packet:

[ IP src=@M dst=@H type=ICMP ]
[ ICMP type=@Type code=@Code ]
[ IP src=@B dst=@A ]
[ UDP sport=@Pb dport=Pa ]

M: the attacker IP
H: the destination IP on which ICMP should be filtered
A: host IP from which the attacker knows an existing session with B
B: host IP from which the attacker knows an existing session with A
Pa: the port used by A its UDP session with B
Pb: the port used by B its UDP session with A
Type: the ICMP type of an out-of-band error packet (example 3)
Code: the ICMP code of an out-of-band error packet (example 3)
```

Under that case, the malicious ICMP[v6] packet will be allowed to pass. Both nftables and Packet Filter implementations are impacted by this behavior.

Figure 3: Abusing the stateful ICMP filtering

Next chapters show the implementation details on Linux and OpenBSD to see where the correlation is lost.

### nftables implementation and details

Linux implements the concept of *related* packets in the netfilter conntrack modules.

It starts in *netfilter/nf\_conntrack\_core.c* with the function *nf\_conntrack\_in* that processes each input packet passed in argument *skb*. Extraction of the layer 4 protocol and ICMP and ICMPv6 are handled in *nf\_conntrack\_handle\_icmp*.

```

unsigned int
nf_conntrack_in(struct sk_buff *skb, const struct nf_hook_state *state)
{
    // ..

    l4proto = __nf_ct_l4proto_find(protonum);

    if (protonum == IPPROTO_ICMP || protonum == IPPROTO_ICMPV6) {
        ret = nf_conntrack_handle_icmp(tmpl, skb, dataoff,
                           protonum, state);
        if (ret <= 0) {
            ret = -ret;
            goto out;
        }
        /* ICMP[v6] protocol trackers may assign one conntrack. */
        if (skb->_nfct)
            goto out;
    }
    // ...
}
```

*nf\_conntrack\_handle\_icmp* then calls *nf\_conntrack\_icmpv4\_error()* or *nf\_conntrack\_icmpv6\_error()* depending on the version of ICMP. Those functions are pretty similar, so let's focus on ICMP.

*nf\_conntrack\_icmpv4\_error* validates the ICMP header and calls *icmp\_error\_message* if the type is one of: ICMP\_DEST\_UNREACH, ICMP\_PARAMETERPROB, ICMP\_REDIRECT, ICMP\_SOURCE\_QUENCH, ICMP\_TIME\_EXCEEDED:

```

/* Small and modified version of icmp_rcv */
int nf_conntrack_icmpv4_error(struct nf_conn *tmpl,
                  struct sk_buff *skb, unsigned int dataoff,
                  const struct nf_hook_state *state)
{
    const struct icmphdr *icmph;
    struct icmphdr _ih;

    /* Not enough header? */
    icmph = skb_header_pointer(skb, ip_hdrlen(skb), sizeof(_ih), &_ih);
    if (icmph == NULL) {
        icmp_error_log(skb, state, "short packet");
        return -NF_ACCEPT;
    }

    // ...

    if (icmph->type > NR_ICMP_TYPES) {
        icmp_error_log(skb, state, "invalid icmp type");
        return -NF_ACCEPT;
    }

    /* Need to track icmp error message? */
    if (icmph->type != ICMP_DEST_UNREACH &&
        icmph->type != ICMP_SOURCE_QUENCH &&
        icmph->type != ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED &&
        icmph->type != ICMP_PARAMETERPROB &&
        icmph->type != ICMP_REDIRECT)
        return NF_ACCEPT;

    return icmp_error_message(tmpl, skb, state);
}
```

*icmp\_error\_message* is then responsible to extract and to identify a matching state:

```

/* Returns conntrack if it dealt with ICMP, and filled in skb fields */
static int
icmp_error_message(struct nf_conn *tmpl, struct sk_buff *skb,
                   const struct nf_hook_state *state)
{
    // ...

    WARN_ON(skb_nfct(skb));
    zone = nf_ct_zone_tmpl(tmpl, skb, &tmp);

    /* Are they talking about one of our connections? */
    if (!nf_ct_get_tuplepr(skb,
                   skb_network_offset(skb) + ip_hdrlen(skb)
                               + sizeof(struct icmphdr),
                   PF_INET, state->net, &origtuple)) {
        pr_debug("icmp_error_message: failed to get tuple\n");
        return -NF_ACCEPT;
    }

    /* rcu_read_lock()ed by nf_hook_thresh */
    innerproto = __nf_ct_l4proto_find(origtuple.dst.protonum);

    /* Ordinarily, we'd expect the inverted tupleproto, but it's
       been preserved inside the ICMP. */
    if (!nf_ct_invert_tuple(&innertuple, &origtuple, innerproto)) {
        pr_debug("icmp_error_message: no match\n");
        return -NF_ACCEPT;
    }

    ctinfo = IP_CT_RELATED;

    h = nf_conntrack_find_get(state->net, zone, &innertuple);
    if (!h) {
         pr_debug("icmp_error_message: no match\n");
        return -NF_ACCEPT;
    }

    if (NF_CT_DIRECTION(h) == IP_CT_DIR_REPLY)
        ctinfo += IP_CT_IS_REPLY;

    /* Update skb to refer to this connection */
    nf_ct_set(skb, nf_ct_tuplehash_to_ctrack(h), ctinfo);
    return NF_ACCEPT;
}
```

1. First, the *network zone* of the packet *skb* is calculated using *nf\_ct\_zone\_tmpl*. nftables has a concept of network conntrack zones. These zones allow virtualizing connections tracking in order to handle multiple connections with equal identities in conntrack and NAT. All packets will go in zone 0 unless asked by an explicit rule (see man page of target CT);
2. Then *nf\_ct\_get\_tuplepr* is used to extract the *ip connection state* *origtuple* from the IP datagram within the ICMP layer;
3. *nf\_ct\_invert\_tuple* performs source/destination swapping of the state because it refers to the original outbound packet but the firewall wants to check an inbound one;
4. *nf\_conntrack\_find\_get* looks for a known state matching the extracted one. At this point we see that the outer IP layer is not taken into consideration to find the state;
5. If a state is found, *nf\_ct\_set* tag the *sbk* packet with the *related* state (IP\_CT\_RELATED).

For ICMPv6 we have a similar implementation for the messages with *type* less than 128.

### Packet Filter implementation and details

In Packet Filter the concept of *related* is in fact implicit and is implemented under the notion of *state*. The overall design of the packet filtering is the following:

* Can the packet be associated with a state ?
  + if yes, the packet is allowed to pass
  + if not, the packet is tested against the filtering rules. If the matching rule allows the packet to pass, a state might be created.

This whole logic is implemented in the function *pf\_test* in */sys/net/pf.c*. The next extract shows this treatment for ICMP[v6] (parts of code has been stripped for the sake of clarity):

```

pf_test(sa_family_t af, int fwdir, struct ifnet *ifp, struct mbuf **m0)
{
    // ...
    switch (pd.virtual_proto) {

    case IPPROTO_ICMP: {
        // look for a known state
        action = pf_test_state_icmp(&pd, &s, &reason);
        s = pf_state_ref(s);

        if (action == PF_PASS || action == PF_AFRT) {
            // if a valid state is found the packet might go there
            // without being tested against the filtering rules
            r = s->rule.ptr;
            a = s->anchor.ptr;
            pd.pflog |= s->log;

        } else if (s == NULL) {
            // if no state is found the packet is tested
            action = pf_test_rule(&pd, &r, &s, &a, &ruleset, &reason);
            s = pf_state_ref(s);
        }
        break;
    }

    case IPPROTO_ICMPV6: {
        // look for a known state
        action = pf_test_state_icmp(&pd, &s, &reason);
        s = pf_state_ref(s);

        if (action == PF_PASS || action == PF_AFRT) {
            // if a valid state is found the packet might go there
            // without being tested against the filtering rules
            r = s->rule.ptr;
            a = s->anchor.ptr;

        } else if (s == NULL) {
            // if no state is found the packet is tested
            action = pf_test_rule(&pd, &r, &s, &a, &ruleset, &reason);

```

*pf\_test\_state\_icmp()* is the function that will try to find a relation between this packet and a known connection. It uses a call to *pf\_icmp\_mapping()* to understand whether the packet is in-band or out-of-band. In the later case, the inner IP packet and its layer 4 protocol are extracted to find a state. This is shown in the following extract:

```

int pf_test_state_icmp(struct pf_pdesc *pd, struct pf_state **state, u_short *reason) {
    // ...

    if (pf_icmp_mapping(pd, icmptype, &icmp_dir, &virtual_id, &virtual_type) == 0) { // <-- 1
        /*

1: *pf\_icmp\_mapping()* determines if an inner packet should be extracted. If yes, then the execution continues.

2: Execution continues at this point only for the following packets:

* ICMP\_UNREACH on IPv4;
* ICMP\_SOURCEQUENCH on IPv4;
* ICMP\_REDIRECT on IPv4;
* ICMP\_TIMXCEED on IPv4;
* ICMP\_PARAMPROB on IPv4;
* ICMP6\_DST\_UNREACH on IPv6;
* ICMP6\_PACKET\_TOO\_BIG on IPv6;
* ICMP6\_TIME\_EXCEEDED on IPv6;
* ICMP6\_PARAM\_PROB on IPv6.

3 & 4: the IP header is extracted depending on the version

5 & 8: the header of UDP or TCP is extracted

6 & 9: a lookup key is initialized, without considering the upper IP packet

7 & 10: the state lookup is performed, and if a state is found the functions can return PF\_PASS, allowing the packet to pass.

### Proof of Concept

To demonstrate the attack we will consider the simple case of a network with 4 hosts, two sub-networks, a LAN and a WAN and a firewall in-between. We will test the scenario with both Linux nftables and OpenBSD Packet Filter as the firewall. Virtual machines or real ones can be used to set up the environment. Note that the IP ranges or family are not relevant to the issue, only NAT can impact the exploitability, this is discussed in the next part.

**Disclaimer 2**: We were notified that we are using real IP prefixes in the experiment and it would have been better to use the ones intended for the documentation.

* The WAN under 1.0.0.0/8, is an untrusted network;
* The LAN under 2.0.0.0/24, is a trusted network which access must be filtered by the firewall;
* M, the attacker on the WAN with the IP 1.0.0.10;
* A, a host on the WAN with the IP 1.0.0.11;
* H, a sensitive server on the LAN with the IP 2.0.0.10;
* B, a host on the LAN with the IP 2.0.0.11;
* F, the firewall between the WAN and the LAN with the IP 1.0.0.2 and 2.0.0.2.

![lab_network](../../sites/default/files/inline-images/lab_network.png)

Figure 4: The lab network

We will consider an established session UDP from A to B on the ports 53 and 1234. The attacker has to know these session parameters, which is not strong assumption as discussed later.

The firewall configuration should:

* block all ICMP coming from the WAN to the LAN;
* allow ICMP from the LAN to the WAN;
* allow the UDP connection between A and B;
* block everything else.

Under those conditions we expect the attacker to not be able to send a single ICMP[v6] packet to H.

For the **Linux** experiment, the firewall is configured as the following (the same could be done with the command nft):

```

# iptables -P INPUT DROP
# iptables -P FORWARD DROP
# iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
# iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A FORWARD -i if-wan -o if-lan -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
```

For the **OpenBSD** experiment the firewall is configured as the following:

```

# em0 is on the WAN
# em1 is on the LAN

block all

# explicitly block icmp from the WAN to the LAN
block in on em0 proto icmp

# allow icmp from the lan to both the WAN and LAN
pass in  on em1 inet proto icmp from em1:network
pass out on em1 inet proto icmp from em1:network
pass out on em0 inet proto icmp from em1:network

# allow udp to B
pass in  on em0 proto udp to b port 53
pass out on em1 proto udp to b port 53
pass in  on em1 proto udp from b port 53
pass out on em0 proto udp from b port 53
```

On B an UDP service is simulated:

```

(B) $ nc -n -u -l 53
```

From A, a connection is established:

```

(A) $ nc -u -n -p 1234 2.0.0.11 53
TEST
```

We can check that inbound ICMP from M to H is filtered:

```

(M) $ ping -c 1 2.0.0.10 -W2

PING 2.0.0.10 (2.0.0.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
--- 2.0.0.10 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms
```

Now we will use the following python script that uses the wonderful [scapy](https://scapy.net/) library:

```

from scapy.all import *
M = "1.0.0.10" # attacker
H = "2.0.0.10" # protected server
A = "1.0.0.11"
B = "2.0.0.11"
Pa = 1234
Pb = 53

icmp_reachable = IP(src=M, dst=H) / \
                 ICMP(type=3, code=3) / \
                 IP(src=B, dst=A) / \
                 UDP(sport=Pb, dport=Pa)
send(icmp_reachable)
```

In both Linux and OpenBSD cases, a network capture shows that the ICMP packet is forwarded by the firewall to H and pass from one interface to another.

![icmp_reachable_wireshark](../../sites/default/files/inline-images/icmp_reachable_wireshark.png)

Figure 5: A Wireshark capture showing that the second ICMP message went from one interface to another

So the attacker was able to send a packet to the normally filtered host H, despite the filtering rules.

### Discussing the state knowledge hypothesis

#### The usual cases

The described attack requires an attacker to know the state of an existing connection, that is, the source and destination IP and port in the case of TCP or UDP. This might sound like a hard assumption, but it is not.

In fact, if an internet facing service such as a web server is behind the firewall, the attacker only has to connect to this service and uses its own connection as a valid state to be able to reach all the hosts behind the firewall via ICMP.

Another scenario involves a victim on the LAN that connects to an attacker controlled server, which can leak a state.

A third one is when the attacker can sniff the victim's traffic. TLS or SSH don't protect here, since the IP and TCP headers are not encrypted.

It is also possible that the attacker is already on a LAN behind the firewall, for instance in an office network, but tries to reach a server in a filtered DMZ. In that situation he can simply initiate an outbound connection from the LAN, then target the DMZ from the outside.

In most cases, those configurations seem plausible enough, but let's discuss the less favorable cases.

#### Guessing connections state

If an attacker can not easily know the state of an active connection on the firewall, he can still try to *guess* one with a bruteforce attack.

In practice, automated environments are more likely to expose known states since systems may often go through the install/discover/setup steps that will generate traffic for DHCP, DNS or NTP. Those protocols are good candidates since less secrets are involved.

* UDP based protocols: DHCP, NTP, ISAKMP. Guessing DHCP state will likely work on networks that do *NOT* expose a DHCP server but that contains clients configured to try DHCP. Source and destination are known in advance. The gateway can be guessed or bruteforced. Guessing NTP states will be likely successful by bruteforcing the NTP client source address against a small set of known possible NTP servers. The same applies to ISAKMP where the source and destination port are fixed.
* Guessing a TCP state will be hard without generating a lot of noise unless the connections tracking implementation do *NOT* check seq/ack fields (the check is recommended by RFC5927). It turns out that nftables does not check the seq/ack fields , therefore TCP based protocols with persistent connections are good candidates: SSH, HTTPS, back-end services, SIP, etc. can be attacked. This kind of attack is documented by RFC5961.
* ICMP states could be known in some rare situations when an application often uses ICMP ECHO request: IP connectivity check, squid pinger, etc.
* AH/ESP: Since nftables nor Packet Filter validate the SPI field, only the source and destination addresses need to be known to recover an existing state.

### Security impact

To sum up, the identified behavior allows an attacker who knows an active connection, to send ICMP[v6] errors to any host behind the firewall, with packets seen as *related*. In most configurations, this leads the packet to be forwarded to its destination without any filtering as related traffic is allowed. This process can be leveraged by the attacker to reach hosts that would normally be unreachable.

We see 4 attacks scenarios abusing this behavior:

1. An attack on the IP stack of a filtered host;
2. The setup of communication with an implant in a filtered network;
3. The use of the vulnerability as an oracle to enumerate existing connections states;
4. An attack which targets a network topology change within a filtered LAN.

The first attack on the IP stack is unlikely, because an attacker only have a few ICMP[v6] messages types available. However, old industrial equipment and less established stacks might be affected if they receive unexpected ICMP packets.

The second attack would be useful to send or receive messages from an implant in a restricted network. Since the payload in the inner datagram of the transmitted ICMP error can be arbitrary, it may be used as a covert channel.

The third attack requires the attacker to be on both sides of the firewall, on the WAN and on the LAN. The idea is to use the traversal of the ICMP packet as a proof that the encapsulated packet matched a connection state. Indeed, the packet is only able to pass if the inner layer can be related to a known connection. This technique can be used in a bruteforce situation where the attacker try, for instance, to guess a source port of an UDP session between an internal host and a legitimate server. This knowledge may be leveraged to ease a traffic injection attack later on.

The fourth attack seems interesting from an attacker perspective but is really impracticable against modern OS. Because both firewalls allow ICMP Redirect to pass through using the described technique, filtered hosts may receive packets that can alter their routing table. However our tests showed that common OS (Linux, Windows macOS) will mitigate this properly.

### Limitations with NAT

The whole concept is to send an ICMP packet to a host on a LAN that should be filtered. However, it is worth mentioning that LANs are often built using NAT and seems to actually be protected against the principle of the attack. This is due to the fact that the address translation process will patch both the inner and the outer IP packets. Therefore, one can only forward a packet within an existing connection which is pointless since it is an expected behavior.

### Should you care ?

Do you need to worry ? **Probably not**, especially on NAT boundaries ... unless:

* you operate systems with less established IP stack that don't really like unexpected ICMP errors.
* you operate firewalls that route traffic between network interfaces of different security levels and need a strict filtering policy.
* you are worried about network implants that may ex-filtrate data from restricted zones.

### What could be done in the firewall implementations ?

The root of the behavior is the lack of correlation between the inner IP packet within the error and the external one. But what could be correlated ?

A legitimate ICMP error related to connection from A to B, should always have its **outer** and **inner** IP headers similar to:

* Outer IP source = B or any intermediary device between A and B
* Outer IP destination = **A**
* Inner IP source = **A**
* Inner IP destination = B

Indeed, the error could have been generated by any host on the path from A to B, and that host is not known in advance. That is why, checking the source IP is not reliable. However, checking the destination IP is. Because this out-of-band ICMP error is addressed to A, it must be a response to an original datagram that has A as a source.

So, a possible additional check that could be implemented is the verification that the inner source IP matches the outer destination IP.

## Conclusion

The issue in Packet Filter was disclosed to OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Oracle Solaris and OPNsense developers and maintainers. They quickly addressed the problem and provided fixes in the following hours. OpenBSD team deployed the [following patch](http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/net/pf.c.diff?r1=1.1080&amp;r2=1.1081&amp;f=h)Â and published the security fix 15 for OpenBSD 6.4. FreeBSD applied a [similar patch](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/629163522da88dd4f99f1f0ccae56e221a1a67f8) and kindly provided the identifier CVE-2019-5598 for this issue.

The Linux developers and maintainers were notified as well. At the time of this publication, no fix is available yet but it will be addressed soon. We decided to still publish this article as the issue is minor and already public (discussed in Linux mailing list and fixed in Packet Filter).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 319 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2559985.1).

 **Please note that since the release of the April 2019 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released two Security Alerts for Oracle WebLogic Server:  [CVE-2019-2725 (April 29, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2725.html) and  [CVE-2019-2729 (June 18, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2729.html). WebLogic Server customers are strongly advised to apply the fixes contained in this Critical Patch Update, which provides the fixes for the previously-released Alerts as well as additional fixes.**

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

pf: Ensure that IP addresses match in ICMP error packets

```
States in pf(4) let ICMP and ICMP6 packets pass if they have a
packet in their payload that matches an exiting connection.  It was
not checked whether the outer ICMP packet has the same destination
IP as the source IP of the inner protocol packet.  Enforce that
these addresses match, to prevent ICMP packets that do not make
sense.
