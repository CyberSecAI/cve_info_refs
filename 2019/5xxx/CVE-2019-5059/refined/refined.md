  "CVE-2019-5059": {
    "description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow, ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when calculating buffer size for XPM image data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Code execution",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Displaying a specially crafted XPM image"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to provide/display a specially crafted XPM image.",
    "additional_details": "The integer overflow happens when multiplying ncolors and cpp to allocate memory for color keys. A small allocated buffer can then be overflowed when copying color data into it."
