- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Winco Fireworks FireFly device does not implement any form of authentication for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections. It accepts any connection and executes commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control (CWE-284) in the BLE functionality. The device lacks authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing any device to connect and issue commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can remotely trigger the firing of any fireworks bay without authentication. This poses a physical safety risk, as an unauthorized user can trigger fireworks unexpectedly.
- **Attack vectors**: A nearby attacker can connect to the device via BLE and send commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within BLE range of the device and have the ability to send BLE commands.
