- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read in the AMD ATIDXX64.DLL driver when processing a specially crafted pixel shader. This occurs due to a missing check when referencing elements outside of a declared constant buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability leading to a NULL pointer dereference. The shader instruction operand (in the `DIV` instruction) references an element outside the declared buffer, causing the driver to attempt to read from an invalid memory address (NULL).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. The vulnerability can be triggered from a VMware guest OS and cause a NULL pointer dereference in the `vmware-vmx.exe` process on the host. Theoretically, it could be triggered through WebGL from a remote website.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted pixel shader file provided to the vulnerable driver. The attack can be triggered from a VMware guest user mode, potentially from a website through WebGL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed pixel shader to the system. For the VMware guest scenario, this could involve user-level access within the guest OS. For the WebGL scenario, it could involve hosting a malicious website.
