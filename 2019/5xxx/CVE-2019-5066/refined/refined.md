- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the way LZW-compressed streams are processed in Aspose.PDF for C++. Specifically, a malformed `Predictor` value within an LZW compressed stream can cause a LZW compression object to be freed prematurely while a stale reference to it is kept.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416) due to a dangling heap pointer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can place arbitrary objects in the freed memory, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting this vulnerability requires processing a specially crafted PDF document by the target application. The vulnerability is triggered when parsing an LZW-compressed stream with a malformed `Predictor` value (e.g., a negative value).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF document and have it processed by the vulnerable Aspose.PDF library. No special privileges or network access is explicitly required.
