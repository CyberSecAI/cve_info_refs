- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing authorization checks in the Atlassian Jira Tempo plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to insufficient access control. Authenticated users can access issue summaries for issues they don't have permission to view.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view the summary of arbitrary issues. This does not display time information collected by the plugin.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a GET request to `/secure/TempoIssueBoard!timesheet.jspa?issue=<ISSUE-KEY>` with a valid `<ISSUE-KEY>`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a valid authenticated session on the Jira instance.
