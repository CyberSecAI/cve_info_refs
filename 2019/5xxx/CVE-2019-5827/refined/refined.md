Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2019-5827:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in SQLite via WebSQL (specifically in Google Chrome's implementation of SQLite)
*   Mismatch of data types between memory allocation functions, where `chrome_sqlite3_malloc` takes a 32-bit integer size argument, while `memcpy` takes a 64-bit size argument. This can lead to wrapping behavior for extreme allocation sizes, causing an out-of-bounds memory access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Integer overflow leading to heap corruption.
*   Out-of-bounds read access vulnerability in the SQLite library.
*   Use-after-free vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected process.
*   **Heap Corruption:** Exploitation can lead to heap corruption.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could cause a denial of service by crashing the application or the browser due to an out-of-bounds access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** In some cases, a heap-based buffer over-read could lead to information leaks.
*   **Bypass Same Origin Policy:**  The vulnerability could be leveraged to bypass the same-origin policy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTML page:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by persuading a victim to visit a specially crafted HTML page.
*   **WebSQL API:** The vulnerability is triggered through the WebSQL API in the browser, where SQLite is used to manage databases.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, leveraging a network connection to deliver malicious content to the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to interact with the crafted content (e.g., by visiting the malicious web page).

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the way memory allocation functions are used within the SQLite library in Chromium. Specifically, `chrome_sqlite3_malloc`'s size argument is a 32-bit integer while the size argument of `memcpy` is 64 bits, potentially leading to integer overflows and incorrect memory allocations.
*   The vulnerability is also linked to the FTS3 extension (Full-Text Search 3) of SQLite, where the integer overflow leads to buffer overflows.
*   Patches for this vulnerability involve ensuring 64-bit allocations are used in the FTS3 extension, and restricting the size of virtual tables to prevent DoS via memory exhaustion.

**Affected Products:**

*   Google Chrome (prior to 74.0.3729.131 for the initial fix, and then a subsequent fix in 75.0.3770.90)
*   Chromium-based browsers
*   SQLite library (especially in the context of its use within Chromium)

**Fixes:**
*   Patches involved updating sqlite version, and ensuring allocation sizes are correctly handled.
*   Chromium was updated to version 75.0.3770.90 which includes the fix.
