CVE-2019-5701:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The NVIDIA GeForce Experience, when GameStream is enabled, is vulnerable to a binary planting or DLL preloading attack due to the lack of path or signature validation when loading Intel graphics driver DLLs.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of safe DLL loading, allowing DLL hijacking.
  - Impact of exploitation:
      - Denial of service
      - Information disclosure
      - Escalation of privileges through code execution. An attacker can execute code as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
  - Attack vectors: A local attacker with local system access can load malicious DLLs in writable directories listed under the system path.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
      - Local system access.
      - Ability to write to directories listed under the system path.
  - Affected Products: GeForce Experience version 3.20.0.118 and older
  - Mitigation: Upgrade to version 3.20.1.57 or later.
