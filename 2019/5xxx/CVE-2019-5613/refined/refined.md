- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing check in the IPsec implementation allows an attacker to reinject old packets. Specifically, the IPsec anti-replay window check was not performed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a check for replayed packets, which should be dropped based on their sequence numbers using a sliding window mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can capture valid IPsec packets and replay them, potentially causing the receiving endpoint to repeat actions that were only intended to be performed once. The specific impact depends on the higher-level protocols in use over IPsec.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must be able to capture legitimate IPsec packets in order to replay them.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack or eavesdrop on the network traffic to capture IPsec packets. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, they just need access to the network traffic.
