##### **3. Partial denial of service vulnerability in ESXi hostd process (CVE-2019-5528)**

**Description:**
Multiple failed login attempts to ESXi may cause the hostd service to become unresponsive resulting in a partial denial of service for management functionality. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Moderate severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [5.3](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
 **Known Attack Vectors:**

A malicious actor with network access to an ESXi host could create a partial denial of service condition in management functionality. Successful exploitation of this issue may cause hostd to become unresponsive resulting in conditions such as an ESXi host disconnecting from vCenter.
 **Resolution:**
To remediate this vulnerability, apply the patches listed in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Resolution Matrix' found below.
 **Workarounds:**
Workarounds are available for this issue, follow the instructions in the documents linked in the 'Workarounds' section found below.
 **Additional Documentations:**

**Notes:**

* If hostd becomes unresponsive due to CVE-2019-5528 the condition can be cleared by restarting the hostd service, it is not necessary to reboot the ESXi host.
* Vulnerability scanners have been reported to trigger this vulnerability via multiple failed login attempts to ESXi.
