Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-5528:

**Root Cause:**
Multiple failed login attempts to an ESXi host can cause the `hostd` service to become unresponsive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The `hostd` service, responsible for management functionality on ESXi hosts, does not handle excessive failed login attempts gracefully, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability is related to the service being overwhelmed when handling multiple failed login requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Partial denial of service for management functionality on the ESXi host.
- `hostd` service becomes unresponsive, potentially causing the ESXi host to disconnect from vCenter.
- The host may become unmanageable until the `hostd` service is restarted.
-  Log entries related to HTTP session exhaustion, admission failures, and pam_tally2 errors.

**Attack Vectors:**
A malicious actor with network access to an ESXi host can trigger this vulnerability by initiating multiple failed login attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the ESXi host.
- No specific privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered by failed login attempts.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by automated vulnerability scanners that perform login attempts.
- Restarting the `hostd` service resolves the issue without requiring a full host reboot.
- A workaround involves modifying the `config.xml` file to disable `ioTrackers` and restarting the hostd service.
- Patches are available for ESXi versions 6.5 and 6.7 to fully remediate the vulnerability, with ESXi 6.0 being unaffected.
- The issue can manifest with the ESXi host showing as "Not responding" in vCenter.
- Log entries will be generated in `vobd.log`, `hostd.log`, `vmkernel.log` and `vmsyslogd-dropped.log`
