Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-5543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is that the folder containing configuration files for the VMware USB arbitration service was found to be writable by all users on Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file system permissions on the configuration folder. This allows any local user to write to the folder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can exploit this to run commands as any other user on the system. This means an attacker could potentially gain higher privileges, including administrative privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By manipulating the configuration files, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of another user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users on the system where the affected software is installed (VMware Horizon Client for Windows, VMRC for Windows, and Workstation for Windows).
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required for successful exploitation. An attacker must have access to the local machine and would need to perform an action that triggers code execution within the context of the target user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a regular user account on the Windows machine where the vulnerable software is installed.
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to the folder containing the configuration files of the VMware USB arbitration service.

**Affected Products:**

- VMware Horizon Client for Windows (versions 5.x and prior)
- VMware Remote Console for Windows (VMRC) (versions 10.x)
- VMware Workstation for Windows (versions 15.x)

**Fixed Versions:**

- VMware Horizon Client for Windows: 5.3.0
- VMware Remote Console for Windows: 11.0.0
- VMware Workstation for Windows: 15.5.2
