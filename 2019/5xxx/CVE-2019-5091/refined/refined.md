The provided content is a vulnerability report for CVE-2019-5091.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `LDicomAssociate::SetBinary` function in the LEADTOOLS libltdic.so library when parsing DICOM packets. Specifically, during the parsing of "Presentation Contexts," the code enters an infinite loop if a byte of user input (`cl`) is not equal to 0x30 or 0x40. This occurs while processing the “Abstract Syntax” (tag: 0x30) and “Transfer Syntax” (tag: 0x40) fields within a DICOM packet.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a missing boundary condition in the parsing logic within the `LDicomAssociate::SetBinary` function. The code iterates through data without properly validating that the input byte corresponds to the expected tag values (0x30 or 0x40), resulting in an infinite loop if an unexpected byte is encountered. Specifically, the code loops infinitely if `cl` is neither 0x30 or 0x40:

```
.text:00007FFFF62FB57E loop_top:
.text:00007FFFF62FB57E                 cmp     cl, 30h ; '0'
.text:00007FFFF62FB581                 jz      short loc_7FFFF62FB5D0
.text:00007FFFF62FB583                 cmp     cl, 40h ; '@'
.text:00007FFFF62FB586                 jnz     short loc_7FFFF62FB57E  ; loop_top
```

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The infinite loop causes the server to become unresponsive, rendering it unable to handle further requests.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends a specially crafted DICOM packet to a vulnerable server. The malicious packet must have the opcode `PDU_ASSOCIATE_REQUEST` (0x01). The specially crafted request contains bytes that are neither 0x30 or 0x40 within the Presentation Context to trigger the infinite loop.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No specific privileges or prior authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
