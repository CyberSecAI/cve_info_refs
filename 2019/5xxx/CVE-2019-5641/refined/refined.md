Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** An information disclosure vulnerability exists within Rapid7 InsightVM. The vulnerability is triggered when a user's session ends due to inactivity.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability allows for unauthorized viewing of InsightVM information. This is related to session management when user sessions end due to inactivity and indicates that the application might not be clearing sensitive data correctly upon session termination.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially view sensitive information related to InsightVM if they have access to an already-ended user session. This could include configuration details, scan results, vulnerability data, and potentially other sensitive information handled by the InsightVM platform, depending on the state of the application at the time of inactivity timeout.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vectors are both remote and physical. This means an attacker can either be physically present at the machine where the user session is or remotely connected to it.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have access (remote or physical) to the system where an InsightVM user's session has ended due to inactivity. The attacker doesn't need active credentials; they are exploiting an already expired session.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content mentions that this is a post-authentication vulnerability and refers to Rapid7's mitigation philosophy for such vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ashutosh Barot.
*   The CVE has a CVSSv3 score of 1.6, which is very low and suggests that the exploitability and impact of this specific vulnerability might be low. However, the specific impact on the security of the environment depends on the sensitivity of the exposed information.
