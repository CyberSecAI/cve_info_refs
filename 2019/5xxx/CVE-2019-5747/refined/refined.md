Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of memory operations within the BusyBox DHCP utilities, specifically in the `udhcpc` client. The `udhcp_get_option` function does not validate the length of the DHCP option before accessing it, leading to out-of-bounds reads. This can occur when processing options with fixed lengths, such as the subnet mask option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The `udhcp_get_option` function reads beyond the allocated buffer when the length of certain DHCP options is not checked against their expected size. This is present in how both udhcpc and udhcpd handle options and leads to the leakage of memory contents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information by triggering the out-of-bounds read, leaking stack contents potentially containing stack canaries.
*   **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds read may cause the DHCP client to crash leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** A remote attacker could send a crafted DHCP packet to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the network where a vulnerable BusyBox DHCP client or server is operating. They must be able to send DHCP packets to the target.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects `udhcpc` (DHCP client), `udhcpd` (DHCP server) and `udhcp` (DHCP relay).
*   A specific example of exploitation involves sending a crafted DHCP discover message with a malformed DHCP_REQUESTED_IP option which can trigger the out-of-bounds read in the dhcp server (`udhcpd`).
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to ensure 4-byte DHCP options are indeed 4 bytes before accessing them. This was done in the commit `74d9f1ba37010face4bd1449df4d60dd84450b06`
*   The bug report associated with this vulnerability is [Bug 11506](https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11506).
