The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5174.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The iocheckd service on WAGO PFC200 uses a file-backed cache (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`). During parsing of this XML file, the `subnetmask` parameter is extracted and used in a command executed via `system()`. The program uses `sprintf()` to format the command using the value of the `subnetmask` node. This allows for OS command injection because the value of the node is not properly sanitized before being used as part of a shell command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- OS Command Injection: Specifically, the lack of sanitization of the `subnetmask` parameter from the XML file when constructing a shell command.
- Insecure file permissions: The cache file `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` is globally writable, allowing any user to place a malicious file there.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution with root privileges.
- Privilege escalation, as any user can write to `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` and trigger the parsing of the file.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  An attacker writes a malicious XML file to `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml` containing a crafted `subnetmask` value with shell commands.
2.  An attacker sends a `BC_SaveParameter` message to trigger the parsing of the XML cache file by the iocheckd service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to write files to the `/tmp` directory of the WAGO PFC200 device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the device in order to trigger the parsing of the malicious XML file.
