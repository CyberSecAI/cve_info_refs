## Download Type

**Production Branch/Studio** Most users select this choice for optimal stability and performance. The NVIDIA RTX Enterprise Production Branch driver is a rebrand of the Quadro Optimal Driver for Enterprise (ODE). It offers the same ISV certification, long life-cycle support, regular security updates, and access to the same functionality as prior Quadro ODE drivers and corresponding Studio Drivers (i.e., of the same driver version number).

**New Feature Branch (NFB)/Quadro New Feature (QNF)** Users occasionally select this choice for access to new features, bug fixes, new operating system support, and other driver enhancements offered between Production Branch releases. Support duration for New Feature Branches is shorter than that for Production Branches.

## Download Type

**"All"** Shows all available driver options for the selected product.

**"Game Ready Drivers"** provide the best possible gaming experience for all major games. NVIDIA's driver team exhaustively tests games from early access through release of each DLC to optimize for performance, stability, and functionality. These drivers are certified by Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL).

**"NFB / SLB"** **New Feature Branch (NFB)** [formerly known as Linux Short Lived Branch (SLB)] New Feature Branch Linux drivers provide early adopters and bleeding edge developers access to the latest driver features before they are integrated into the Production Branches.
