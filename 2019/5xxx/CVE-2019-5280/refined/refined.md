- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient verification of specific parameters of the TLS server certificate in the SIP TLS module of Huawei 7900 IP phones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper TLS certificate validation. Specifically, not adequately checking parameters of the TLS server certificate.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can perform man-in-the-middle attacks. This leads to affected phones registering abnormally and causes disruption in availability of the IP phones.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be able to intercept communication data between the phone and server. This indicates a network-based man-in-the-middle attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network to intercept the communication data flow between the IP phone and the server. This requires a privileged network position, likely achieved by compromising the network infrastructure.
