Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-5164:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ss-manager` binary of Shadowsocks-libev, specifically in how it handles the `plugin` parameter when spawning `ss-server` instances. The `ss-manager` allows for specifying an arbitrary binary to be executed as a plugin via the `plugin` parameter, which is then executed by `ss-server`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unvalidated Input:** The `ss-manager` does not validate or sanitize the `plugin` parameter. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary executable file.
- **Code Injection:** By controlling the `plugin` parameter, the attacker can effectively inject code by specifying a malicious binary to be run.
- **Missing Authentication:** The `ss-manager` listens on a local UDP socket, and does not perform proper authentication, allowing an attacker with local access to send arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the `ss-server` process.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the `ss-server` process runs with elevated privileges, the attacker can escalate their privileges to the same level, potentially gaining root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Packets:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted network packets to the `ss-manager` listening on the UDP localhost socket. These packets contain a crafted command including the `plugin` parameter.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to send network packets to the `ss-manager` process, since the manager is listening on localhost.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where `ss-manager` is running to send UDP packets to the `ss-manager` socket.
- **Malicious Binary:** The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious binary on the system accessible by the `ss-server` process.

**Technical Details:**

The `ss-manager` process listens for commands on a UDP socket.  When it receives an `add` command, it spawns a new `ss-server` process.  The `plugin` parameter in the `add` command allows specifying a binary to be run as a plugin. The `ss-server` process uses `cork_exec_new` to create an executable object and then executes the plugin using `cork_subprocess_start`.  The `plugin_opts` parameter is also passed along to the plugin, but is not the primary vulnerability. The lack of input sanitization on `plugin`, allows the attacker to specify an arbitrary malicious executable.

This vulnerability is similar to a previously fixed issue but exploits a different code path. The suggested workaround from the original developers was to use a unix domain socket instead of a localhost UDP socket.
