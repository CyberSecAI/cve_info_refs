Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-5689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the Downloader component of NVIDIA GeForce Experience. It stems from insufficient input validation when downloading files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Handling: A user with local system access can craft malicious input that influences the file download process.
- Unrestricted File Download: The crafted input allows malicious files to be downloaded and saved.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- Code execution: Malicious files could be executed on the system.
- Denial of service: A malicious file could cause the application to crash or become unusable.
- Information disclosure: Malicious files could potentially extract sensitive information from the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local System Access: The attacker requires local system access.
- Crafted Input: The attacker needs to craft specific input to trigger the vulnerability in the Downloader component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local system access is required, meaning the attacker needs to have a user account on the target machine.
- The attacker also needs to have the ability to influence the input of the NVIDIA GeForce Experience Downloader component to download malicious files, however it does not require elevated privileges

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R) to be exploited, suggesting a user would need to run a specific crafted input to trigger the download, or be tricked into doing so, or that some type of action needs to be performed after the download to trigger the code execution..
- The vulnerability is rated as having a base score of 6.7, with high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
