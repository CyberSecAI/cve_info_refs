So you want to create a beautiful form, the problem is, you are not a developer and of course you have no time to learn any of that?, well, if that is you (or your client) this is the plugin for you.

This plugin is focused in making really easy the process of creating your forms, with it you can add formulas to calculate totals (it doesn’t matter if your totals require complex calculations) or show the fields that you need just when you need them.

Emailing is easy, you can even send different types of emails to different persons at the same time, again no coding needed at all since everything is configured in a friendly screen.

You do know programing or web development? That’s fine!, even though it is not needed, because there is a friendly interface for everything, you can still use those skills to add custom css or javascript code into your form and tweak it as you want it.

If you want to learn more keep reading, there is a list of features bellow, or even better check out the video tutorials here: http://smartforms.rednao.com/tutorials. I hope you like it =).

Not only is this easy to use & flexible, some of the features (such as conditional fields & payments) makes this a very powerful form tool. Support was outstanding when I had questions!

Mit Smart Forms Pro lassen sich sehr nützliche Kontaktformulare erstellen. Wenn man das Prinzip des Aufbaus einmal verinnerlicht hat, sind sie innerhalb von wenigen Minuten erstellt. Responsiv sind sie zudem auch noch.
Fomulare mit “Conditional Logik”, bei denen sich zusätzliche Eingabefelder erst zeigen, wenn eine Auswahl angeklickt wurde. Damit komplizierte / aufwendige Formulare übersichtlich bleiben, können mehrere Schritte (Ebenen) erzeugt werden.
Mich stört nur, dass sich die Farben der Sedebutton nicht exakt bestimmen lassen. Das ist aber kein Grund, um einen ganzen Stern abzuziehen.

I really don’t know how I got it to work on the first place. Installing it is supper easy. the issue with Wordpress and sending emails. I had to install another plugin so it could send emails. But once you get that accomplish you are good to go. And Man!!! How good is the support? The creator even helped me figure out something I could have not all by myself. If you have any errors or don’t know why something is not working. just reach out to the support team. They take their sweet time answering (that me being silly and demanding. LOL!!!!) it took them about 24 hours on weekdays, to replay, and they seem not to answer on the weekends. But once they answer they are there for you, I mean. They even went into my Wordpress to look for what was wrong and fixed it for me. Who takes the time? well, they did. I could not be happier. Because, I was looking for a plug in I could use to make online contracts, that would auto fill in the data, and send an email to the customer. Guess what… We got it done!!!! and thats not all, it sends the email as you want it and can send a pdf file as well so anyone that receives that email, can download a copy of the PDF and the information you choose to share on it. I’m far above satisfied with this plug in. —- I just wish it could also manage inventory for rental. but hey who knows maybe in the future.
