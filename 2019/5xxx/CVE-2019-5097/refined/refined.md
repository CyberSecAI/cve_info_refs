- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the processing of multi-part/form-data HTTP requests within the GoAhead web server. Specifically, if a client connection is terminated before the server receives the amount of data specified in the Content-Length header, the server enters an infinite loop attempting to send a response to the closed socket.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is an infinite loop condition triggered by a prematurely terminated connection during multipart/form-data processing. The vulnerability occurs in the websFlush function when attempting to write data to a closed socket, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, characterized by 100% CPU utilization, due to the infinite loop. The server becomes unresponsive, and the potential for further denial of service is increased, impacting system resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending a specially crafted HTTP request, either GET or POST, with a Content-Length header specifying more data than actually sent. The request does not require the requested resource to exist on the server, or authentication by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and only needs to send a crafted HTTP request. They need to be able to initiate a TCP connection with the vulnerable web server, and send a request with a `Content-Length` that does not match the request's body length.
