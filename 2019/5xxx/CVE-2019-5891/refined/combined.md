COLLECTED BY

Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/webwidecrawl)

The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.
At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.
View the web archive through the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php).

Collection: [Live Web Proxy Crawls](https://archive.org/details/liveweb)

Content crawled via the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) Live Proxy mostly by the Save Page Now feature on web.archive.org.

Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.
