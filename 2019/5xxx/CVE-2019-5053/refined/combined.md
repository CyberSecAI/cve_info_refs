# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0830

## NitroPDF Stream Length Memory Corruption Vulnerability

##### October 9, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5053

### Summary

An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the Length parsing function of NitroPDF. A specially crafted PDF can cause a type confusion, resulting in a use-after-free condition. An attacker can craft a malicious PDF to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

NitroPDF 12.2.1.522

### Product URLs

<https://www.gonitro.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-416: Use After Free

### Details

NitroPDF is a popular PDF tool used to create and edit PDF files. NitroPDF has a wide array of features for automated PDF creation as well as reviewing differences between various PDFs.

The module tested for this advisory is below:

```
00007ffb`eb750000 00007ffb`ec559000   npdf       (export symbols)       npdf.dll
    Loaded symbol image file: npdf.dll
    Image path: C:\Program Files\Nitro\Pro\12\npdf.dll
    Image name: npdf.dll
    Browse all global symbols  functions  data
    Timestamp:        Tue Mar 26 15:48:15 2019 (5C9A900F)
    CheckSum:         00D05033
    ImageSize:        00E09000
    File version:     12.12.1.522
    Product version:  12.12.1.522

```

One attribute PDFs to read a Length value of a field is /Length. This attribute expects a valid integer for its parameter. A simple example of this is shown below:

```
21 0 obj
<< /Filter /Flate /Length 17 >>
stream

endstream
endobj

```

When parsed, this integer is converted to internal Integer object via CosIntegerValue.

```
npdf+0x352508
.text:0000000000352508                 mov     rcx, [rsp+0D8h+var_28]
.text:0000000000352510                 call    ?CosIntegerValue@@YAHUOPAQUE_64_BITS@@@Z ; CosIntegerValue(OPAQUE_64_BITS)
.text:0000000000352515                 nop

```

This Integer object is then inserted into the document dictionary used for later reference. If the /Length value is instead a reference object, the parser continues to treat this value as a normal integer.

```
21 0 obj
<< /Filter /Flate /Length 17 0 R >>
stream

endstream
endobj

```

When the parser attempts to use this reference object as an integer, the parser recognizes that the value is incorrect, and frees the object. This reference object is not removed from the document dictionary itself, causing a stale pointer to be left behind in the main dictionary.

This can be further shown in the trace of the proof of concept.

```
            = Action   = Size      = Address       = Flags  = (+) TimeStart = (+) TimeEnd  = Result =
= [0x14966] - Alloc    - 0x2040    - 0x1beac7f2fc0 - 0x0    - 1A72BD:5AF    - 1A72DA:3E    -        =
= [0x122e9] - Free     -           - 0x1beac7f2fc0 - 0x0    - 2FDA24:631    - 2FDA56:44    - 0x1    =

```

The address is freed at the 2FD124:631 time and further used at 37E328:0.

```
Time Travel Position: 37E328:0
npdf!CAPUnit::operator=+0x9ca:
00007ff9`897626da f6431004        test    byte ptr [rbx+10h],4 ds:000001be`ac7f4680=02

```

This constitutes a use after free condition. By using other elements of the PDF document it would be possible to allocate a controlled object in place of the freed one before the stale pointer is reused which would result in further memory corruption and ultimately arbitrary code execution.

### Crash Information

```
(84920.f7118): Access violation - code c0000005 (first/second chance not available)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
Time Travel Position: 37E328:0
npdf!CAPUnit::operator=+0x9ca:
