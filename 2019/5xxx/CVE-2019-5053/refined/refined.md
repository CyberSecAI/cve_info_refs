- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A type confusion occurs when the PDF parser treats a reference object as an integer during the processing of the `/Length` attribute, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free (CWE-416) vulnerability due to the parser freeing a reference object but not removing its pointer from the document dictionary.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. By controlling memory allocation, an attacker can place controlled data at the memory location of the freed object and subsequently trigger a use-after-free, leading to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted PDF document is used to trigger the vulnerability when parsed by NitroPDF.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF and have the user open it with a vulnerable version of NitroPDF.
