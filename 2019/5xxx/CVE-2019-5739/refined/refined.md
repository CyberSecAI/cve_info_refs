  "CVE-2019-5739": {
    "description": "Keep-alive HTTP and HTTPS connections can remain open and inactive for up to 2 minutes in Node.js 6.16.0 and earlier. Node.js 8.0.0 introduced a dedicated server.keepAliveTimeout which defaults to 5 seconds. The behavior in Node.js 6.16.0 and earlier is a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector. Node.js 6.17.0 introduces server.keepAliveTimeout and the 5-second default.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of a keep-alive timeout in versions of Node.js prior to 6.17.0. This allows connections to remain open indefinitely, consuming server resources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by exploiting the keep-alive functionality, causing resource exhaustion by keeping connections open for extended periods.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker with network access is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need any special credentials or privileges.",
    "affected_versions": "All versions of Node.js 6 (LTS \"Boron\") are vulnerable. Node.js versions 8, 10 and 11 are NOT vulnerable to this issue. Node.js versions before 6.17.0 are vulnerable to this issue."
