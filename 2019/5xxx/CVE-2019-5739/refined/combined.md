February 2019 Security Releases

*(Update 28-February-2018)* **Security releases available**

## [Summary](#summary)

Updates are now available for all active Node.js release lines. In addition to fixes for security flaws in Node.js, they also include upgrades of Node.js 6 and 8 to OpenSSL 1.0.2r which contains a fix for a moderate severity security vulnerability. The original announcement is included below.

For these releases, we have decided to withhold the fix for the Misinterpretation of Input ([CWE-115](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)) flaw mentioned in the original announcement. This flaw is very low severity and we are not satisfied that we had a complete and stable fix ready for release. We will be seeking to address this flaw via alternate mechanisms in the near future. In addition, we have introduced an additional CVE for a change in Node.js 6 that we have decided to classify as a Denial of Service ([CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)) flaw.

We recommend that all Node.js users upgrade to a version listed below as soon as possible.

## [Downloads & release details](#downloads--release-details)

Downloads are available for the following versions. Details of code changes can also be found on each release page.

* [Node.js 11.10.1 (Current)](/en/blog/release/v11.10.1)
* [Node.js 10.15.2 (LTS "Dubnium")](/en/blog/release/v10.15.2)
* [Node.js 8.15.1 (LTS "Carbon")](/en/blog/release/v8.15.1)
* [Node.js 6.17.0 (LTS "Boron")](/en/blog/release/v6.17.0)

## [Node.js: Slowloris HTTP Denial of Service with keep-alive (CVE-2019-5737)](#nodejs-slowloris-http-denial-of-service-with-keep-alive-cve-2019-5737)

*Categorization: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption / Denial of Service ([CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html))*

All actively supported release lines are vulnerable and the severity is LOW. An attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly thereby keeping the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer.

This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12122, addressed in [November, 2018](/en/blog/vulnerability/november-2018-security-releases/). The 40 second timeout and its adjustment by `server.headersTimeout` apply to this fix as in CVE-2018-12122.

CVE-2018-12122 originally reported by Jan Maybach ([liebdich.com](https://liebdich.com)), keep-alive variant reported by [Marco Pracucci](https://twitter.com/pracucci) ([Voxnest](https://voxnest.com)), fixed by [Matteo Collina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina).

**Impact:**

* All versions of Node.js 6 (LTS "Boron") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 8 (LTS "Carbon") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 10 (LTS "Dubnium") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 11 (Current) **are** vulnerable

## [Node.js: Denial of Service with keep-alive HTTP connections (CVE-2019-5739)](#nodejs-denial-of-service-with-keep-alive-http-connections-cve-2019-5739)

*Categorization: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption / Denial of Service ([CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html))*

Keep-alive HTTP and HTTPS connections can remain open and inactive for up to 2 minutes in Node.js 6.16.0 and earlier. Node.js 8.0.0 introduced a dedicated [`server.keepAliveTimeout`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_keepalivetimeout) which defaults to 5 seconds. The behavior in Node.js 6.16.0 and earlier is a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector. Node.js 6.17.0 introduces `server.keepAliveTimeout` and the 5-second default.

The original fix was submitted by [Timur Shemsedinov](https://github.com/tshemsedinov) ([nodejs/node#2534](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2534)) and backported by [Matteo Collina](https://twitter.com/matteocollina).

**Impact:**

* All versions of Node.js 6 (LTS "Boron") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 8 (LTS "Carbon") **are NOT** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 10 (LTS "Dubnium") **are NOT** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 11 (Current) **are NOT** vulnerable

## [OpenSSL: 0-byte record padding oracle (CVE-2019-1559)](#openssl-0-byte-record-padding-oracle-cve-2019-1559)

*Severity: MODERATE*

OpenSSL 1.0.2r contains a fix for [CVE-2019-1559](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190226.txt) and is included in the releases for Node.js versions 6 and 8 only. Node.js 10 and 11 are not impacted by this vulnerability as they use newer versions of OpenSSL which do not contain the flaw.

Under certain circumstances, a TLS server can be forced to respond differently to a client if a zero-byte record is received with an invalid *padding* compared to a zero-byte record with an invalid *MAC*. This can be used as the basis of a [padding oracle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack) to decrypt data.

Only TLS connections using certain ciphersuites executing under certain conditions are exploitable. We are currently unable to determine whether the use of OpenSSL in Node.js exposes this vulnerability. We are taking a cautionary approach and recommend the same for users. For more information, see the [advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190226.txt) and a [detailed write-up](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Padding-Oracles) by the reporters of the vulnerability.

**Impact:**

* All versions of Node.js 6 (LTS "Boron") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 8 (LTS "Carbon") **are** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 10 (LTS "Dubnium") **are NOT** vulnerable
* All versions of Node.js 11 (Current) **are NOT** vulnerable

## [Summary](#summary-1)

The Node.js project will release new versions of all supported release lines on, or shortly after, Wednesday, February 27th, 2019 UTC. These releases will incorporate at least two security fixes specific to Node.js, the highest severity of which is 'low'.

The OpenSSL project has announced [releases](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2019-February/000145.html) for the 26th which may impact some release lines of Node.js and require inclusion in our security releases. The highest severity indicated by OpenSSL is ['moderate'](https://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html#moderate) and impacts OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is used by Node.js 6.x and 8.x. A bug-fix release for OpenSSL 1.1.1 will also be made available and we will assess the impact, if any, on Node.js 11.x which uses this version. Node.js 10.x will not be impacted by the OpenSSL releases.

## [Impact](#impact)

Releases for all actively supported release lines will be made available to fix the following vulnerabilities.

All versions of **Node.js 6 (LTS "Boron")** are vulnerable to:

* 1 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption / Denial of Service ([CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)) vulnerability
* 1 Misinterpretation of Input ([CWE-115](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html)) vulnerability
* Possible update to OpenSSL 1.0.2r depending on assessed impact

# CVE-2019-5737

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-5736.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-5739.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5737 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5737)

#### Description

In Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly. This keeps the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.

# CVE-2019-1559

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-1552.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-1563.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-1559 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1559)

#### Description

If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL\_shutdown() twice (once to send a close\_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL\_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1127533#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-03-01 13:46:51 UTC  ``` <https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/february-2019-security-releases/>  Node.js: Denial of Service with keep-alive HTTP connections (CVE-2019-5739)  Categorization: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption / Denial of Service (CWE-400)  Keep-alive HTTP and HTTPS connections can remain open and inactive for up to 2 minutes in Node.js 6.16.0 and earlier. Node.js 8.0.0 introduced a dedicated server.keepAliveTimeout which defaults to 5 seconds. The behavior in Node.js 6.16.0 and earlier is a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector. Node.js 6.17.0 introduces server.keepAliveTimeout and the 5-second default.  The original fix was submitted by Timur Shemsedinov) and backported by Matteo Collina.  Impact:     All versions of Node.js 6 (LTS "Boron") are vulnerable     All versions of Node.js 8 (LTS "Carbon") are NOT vulnerable     All versions of Node.js 10 (LTS "Dubnium") are NOT vulnerable     All versions of Node.js 11 (Current) are NOT vulnerable ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1127533#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-05 16:30:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1127533) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/681821> Factory / nodejs6 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1127533#c4)  Karol Babioch   2019-03-06 12:29:09 UTC  ``` Adam, what about those other nodejs versions that we have around? You made submissions for nodejs4 and nodejs6, but we also have nodejs and nodejs8.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1127080#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-02-26 21:33:00 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-1559 <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190226.txt>                                                                                                OpenSSL Security Advisory [26 February 2019] ============================================  0-byte record padding oracle (CVE-2019-1559) ============================================  Severity: Moderate  If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data.  In order for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway).  This issue does not impact OpenSSL 1.1.1 or 1.1.0.  OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2r.  This issue was discovered by Juraj Somorovsky, Robert Merget and Nimrod Aviram, with additional investigation by Steven Collison and Andrew Hourselt. It was reported to OpenSSL on 10th December 2018. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1127080#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2019-02-26 21:33:46 UTC  ``` 1.0.2 branch:  commit 48c8bcf5bca0ce7751f49599381e143de1b61786 Author: Matt Caswell <matt@openssl.org> Date:   Wed Feb 20 14:21:36 2019 +0000      Clarify that SSL_shutdown() must not be called after a fatal error          Follow on from CVE-2019-1559          Reviewed-by: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>  commit e9bbefbf0f24c57645e7ad6a5a71ae649d18ac8e Author: Matt Caswell <matt@openssl.org> Date:   Fri Dec 14 07:28:30 2018 +0000      Go into the error state if a fatal alert is sent or received          If an application calls SSL_shutdown after a fatal alert has occured and     then behaves different based on error codes from that function then the     application may be vulnerable to a padding oracle.

The fix is fortunately trivial.  From the authors (<https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Padding-Oracles>) and the openssl advisory, the following conditions must be met for the issue to be exploitable.  (1) A non-stitched ciphersuite is in use That means not-AEAD and not-AES on openssl >= 1.0.1, because AES implementations are stitched there. On openssl < 1.0.1 all the ciphers are non-stitched.  (2) The application has incorrect SSL_shutdown() handling It calls SSL_shutdown() twice despite a fatal error being encountered beforehand.  For a successful exploitation the attacker must be able to:   (1) run a script in the victim's browser (eg. via a malicious website) which sends requests to a vulnerable server  (2) modify requests sent by the browser and observe the server behavior (active MitM attack) ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1127080#c13)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-28 20:11:43 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:1076-1: An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.
