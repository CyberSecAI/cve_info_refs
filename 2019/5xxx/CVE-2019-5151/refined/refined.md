- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `getVideo` function in `/objects/video.php` does not sanitize user input from the `$_GET['videoName']` parameter, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection: The `$_GET['videoName']` parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI): The `vType` variable, which is extracted from the SQL query result, is used in a `require` statement, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local PHP files by manipulating the SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): A specially crafted SQL query can cause the server to perform resource-intensive operations.
    - Data Exfiltration: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database using SQL injection.
    - Code Execution: By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code by including a malicious PHP file.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a malicious HTTP request to `/index.php` with a crafted `videoName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They can send a request from any location accessible to the vulnerable server.
