- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `java.env script` field in the Exhibitor Web UI allows users to inject arbitrary shell commands. These commands are then executed by the Exhibitor process when it launches ZooKeeper. This is due to the lack of sanitization of the user-provided input before passing it to the Java command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability (CWE-78) due to lack of input sanitization and direct execution of the injected commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the Exhibitor process, leading to potential full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: By submitting a crafted POST request or through the Exhibitor web UI, an attacker can modify the `java.env script` field to include shell commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the Exhibitor web UI. No authentication is required.

This report provides more detail than the official CVE description by specifying the vulnerable parameter (`java.env script`), the methods for command injection (backticks or $()), and providing proof-of-concept exploit steps.
