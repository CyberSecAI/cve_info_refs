Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-5859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Some URIs can load alternative browsers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Chrome handles certain URIs, allowing them to potentially launch alternative browsers. This suggests a flaw in URI parsing or handling within Chrome, possibly related to how specific URI schemes or formats are interpreted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to unexpected behavior where a malicious website could force the user to open a different browser instead of handling the URI within Chrome. This could be used for various malicious purposes, like phishing attacks using lookalike browsers or redirecting users to malicious content through the launched browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via specially crafted URIs. These URIs would need to be provided to the vulnerable browser through a webpage or another method that allows the user to interact with these malformed URIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to craft specific URIs and present them to the victim (user of the vulnerable Chrome version). This could be achieved through various methods such as:
    - Embedding the malicious URI on a website the victim visits
    - Sending a link containing the malicious URI through email or other messaging platforms.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
- The issue was reported by James Lee (@Windowsrcer) of Kryptos Logic on 2019-05-03.
- The provided information comes from the Chrome release notes. Further details might be available in the referenced Chromium bug report ([959438](https://crbug.com/959438)).

In summary, CVE-2019-5859 is a URI handling vulnerability that could be exploited to launch alternative browsers, potentially leading to further malicious activity, by tricking Chrome through malicious URI links.
