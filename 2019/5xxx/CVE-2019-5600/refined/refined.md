{
  "CVE-2019-5600": {
    "Description": "The iconv(3) API converts text data from one character encoding to another and is available as part of the standard C library (libc). With certain inputs, iconv may write beyond the end of the output buffer.",
    "Root cause": "Improper bounds checking in the iconv library when converting between certain character encodings leads to a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Improper bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker may be able to create a denial of service, provoke incorrect program behavior, or induce a remote code execution. The nature of possible attacks will depend on the way in which iconv is used by applications or daemons.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafting specific input strings that trigger the buffer overflow during character encoding conversion.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide malicious input to applications or daemons that use the vulnerable `iconv` function. No special privileges required."
