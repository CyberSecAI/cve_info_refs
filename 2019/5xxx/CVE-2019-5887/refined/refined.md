```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper filename validation in the file deletion functionality, allowing directory traversal using '../'.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure direct object references",
    "Path traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file and directory deletion, potentially leading to system reinstallation by deleting the install lock file and other critical system data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious request to the file deletion function with a payload containing '../', an attacker can traverse up the directory tree.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be authenticated to access the administrative file management panel, and have the ability to modify the request parameters."
