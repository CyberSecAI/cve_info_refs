{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "FRR had a developmental escape that read BGP attribute type 255 (experimental VNC) incorrectly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect handling of BGP attribute type 255 (experimental VNC), leading to BGP peering session flaps.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service via BGP peering session flapping.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a BGP update with an attribute type of 0xFF (255).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to inject a crafted BGP update into the global routing table."
