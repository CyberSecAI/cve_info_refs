Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-5690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `nvlddmkm.sys` kernel mode driver, specifically in the handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. The root cause is a lack of input buffer size validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The driver fails to validate the size of the input buffer provided to the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler. This lack of validation is the core weakness that allows for the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially trigger a denial of service by providing a malformed or overly large input buffer that the driver is not designed to handle, leading to a crash or instability.
- **Escalation of Privileges:** An attacker could potentially leverage the vulnerability to gain elevated system privileges, which could result in complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through a local attack.
- The attack vector is through the `DxgkDdiEscape` interface of the display driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to have a low level of privilege on the targeted system.
