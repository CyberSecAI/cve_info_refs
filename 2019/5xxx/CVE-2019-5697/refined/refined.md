Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-5697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The NVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager has a vulnerability where it may grant a guest access to memory that it does not own.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper access control, allowing a guest virtual machine to access memory outside of its allocated space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A malicious guest VM could potentially read sensitive data from memory it shouldn't have access to.
- Denial of Service: The issue could potentially lead to crashes or instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring a malicious guest VM to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control or access to a guest virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code within the guest VM.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects NVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager and not the display driver itself.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple hypervisor environments: Citrix Hypervisor, VMware vSphere, Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM, and Nutanix AHV.
