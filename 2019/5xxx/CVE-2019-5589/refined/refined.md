- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsafe search path vulnerability in FortiClient online installers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The online installers for FortiClient for Windows, FortiClientVPN for Windows, and FortiClientEMS do not properly validate the location of DLL files, resulting in DLL hijacking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system by placing malicious DLL files in the same directory as the installer.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker must have control over the directory where the installers reside.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to upload malicious DLL files into the directory where the vulnerable installer resides.
