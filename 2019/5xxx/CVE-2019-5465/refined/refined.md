Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
An authorization issue in the "move issue" feature allows for the disclosure of the newly created issue ID when an issue is moved to a private project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows any authenticated user to discover the internal ID of the new issue created after moving an issue from a public project to a private project.
- **Authorization Bypass:** The system fails to properly restrict access to the `moved_to_id` parameter in the JSON response of the original (now closed) issue, even for users without access to the private project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Leakage of Internal Issue IDs:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the internal IDs of issues moved to private projects.
- **Disclosure of Issue Movement:** By observing the `moved_to_id` parameter, an attacker can infer that an issue has been moved to a different private project, even if they don't have access to that project. This provides information not intended for public disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user can make a GET request to the original issue's JSON endpoint:  `https://gitlab.com/<GroupName>/<ProjectName>/issues/<IssueID>.json` after an issue has been moved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the GitLab instance.
- The attacker does not need to be a member of the project the issue was moved to. They only need to be able to access the original issue (e.g., a member of the public project the issue was initially created in)
- The attacker should know the ID of a closed issue that was moved to a private project.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in GitLab CE/EE versions 8.14 and later.
- The `moved_to_id` parameter is found in the JSON response of the original issue after it has been moved.
- The issue was reported by `ashish_r_padelkar` via HackerOne.
- The vulnerability is considered to have "very low severity."
- The issue was fixed by restricting access to the `moved_to_id` parameter.
