CVE-2019-5017:
```

- **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated remote kernel information disclosure in KCodes NetUSB.ko kernel module, affecting NETGEAR Nighthawk Routers and potentially other vendors/products.
- **Root Cause:** Sending a crafted packet with a specific opcode triggers the kernel module to return several addresses, including one that can be used to calculate the dynamic base address of the module.
- **Attack Vector:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send a crafted packet containing opcode `0x0c` with an index of zero followed by at least 16 bytes of data.
- **Impact:** Disclosure of kernel information, specifically the base address of the NetUSB.ko module, which can be used for further exploitation.
- **Affected Versions:** NETGEAR Nighthawk AC3200 (R8000) Firmware Version V1.0.4.28\_10.1.54 (11/7/18) - NetUSB.ko 1.0.2.66
- **CWE:** CWE-200: Information Exposure
