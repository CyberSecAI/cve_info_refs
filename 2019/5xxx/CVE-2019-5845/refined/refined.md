Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5845:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an out-of-bounds access issue within the SwiftShader component of Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds access:** The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds memory access within the SwiftShader library. This could lead to reading or writing memory outside of the intended buffer.
*   **Heap corruption:** The out-of-bounds access can potentially corrupt the heap, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap corruption:** Successful exploitation could result in heap corruption.
*   **Availability Impact**: The CVSS v3 score indicates a high availability impact, meaning a successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) situation.
*   The provided documents mention that successful exploitation could lead to potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Crafted HTML page:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTML page. This suggests the attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted HTML page to a user of a vulnerable Chrome browser.
*   No special privileges are needed.
*   User interaction is required, specifically that the user visits the attacker-controlled web page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Google Chrome versions prior to 73.0.3683.75.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" severity by SUSE but "important" by Google, with CVSS v3 base scores of 6.5 and 8.8 respectively, differing largely on the impact scope.
*   The provided information includes links to SUSE security advisories and bug reports related to the fixes for this vulnerability, which were addressed in Chromium version 79.0.3945.117 and later.
