{
  "CVE-2019-5721": {
    "Description": "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.11, the ENIP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-enip.c by changing the memory-management approach so that a use-after-free is avoided.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ENIP dissector had a flaw in its memory management, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could cause Wireshark to crash, potentially disrupting network analysis or packet capture processes.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the wire",
      "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to either send malicious packets to be captured by Wireshark or create a malicious capture file and trick the victim into opening it."
