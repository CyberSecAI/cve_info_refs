**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the "Online Lesson Booking" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack. The attacker injects malicious code through the plugin interface.
- The vulnerability requires user interaction in that an administrative user needs to trigger the execution of the malicious script, likely by accessing a page containing the injected payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
