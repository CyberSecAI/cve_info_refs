- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition exists in a specific driver of certain Huawei smartphones. This occurs when multiple processes concurrently operate on the same variable without proper synchronization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of malicious code on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious application. This malicious application then exploits the race condition by triggering concurrent access to a shared variable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to develop a malicious application and convince a user to install it on their device. No specific network position is required.
