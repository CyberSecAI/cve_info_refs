{
  "matches": [
    {
      "vulnerability": "Stack Buffer Overflow",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `CDataConnStreamQueueT::deal_msg` method within `dbman.exe`. The `C++ new` operator allocates memory based on a size specified by the attacker, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack buffer overflow due to attacker-controlled memory allocation size"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability could cause an exception thrown by the `new` operator, resulting in process termination, or a `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN` causing corruption of the exception handler chain leading to remote code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a large allocation size (e.g., 0xfffffff0) to `dbman` via a network connection.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a crafted network packet to the targeted service.",
      "affected_product": "HPE Intelligent Management Center (IMC) PLAT earlier than version 7.3 E0506P09, and the incomplete fixes in 7.3 E0703."
