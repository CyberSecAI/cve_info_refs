The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5075.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `get_coupler_details` command-line utility of the WAGO PFC200. It occurs when copying system data into a stack buffer when responding to a message sent to the `iocheckd` service "I/O-Check".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to insufficient length checking when copying the `MARKING` or `WAGONR` system values into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
- Incorrect buffer length value when using `g_strlcpy`, allowing to write past the allocated buffer.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely and unauthenticated.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. By overflowing the stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address and other saved registers, redirecting execution to attacker-controlled code.
- System crash, as seen in the crash information provided.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted packets to the `iocheckd` service "I/O-Check".
- The attacker can control the content of the `MARKING` and `WAGONR` values, enabling the attacker to overwrite the stack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the WAGO PFC200 controller.
- Ability to send custom packets to the `iocheckd` service "I/O-Check" running on the device.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
