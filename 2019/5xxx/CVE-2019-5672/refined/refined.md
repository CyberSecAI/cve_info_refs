Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Secure Shell (SSH) keys included in the sample `rootfs` of NVIDIA Linux for Tegra (L4T) are not replaced with unique host keys after the sample `rootfs` is generated and flashed onto a device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use of shared SSH keys:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of identical SSH keys across multiple devices using the sample `rootfs`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to devices using the same default SSH keys. If an attacker gains access to one device with the shared key, they can potentially access other devices using that same shared key.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** An attacker could attempt to connect to a device via SSH using the known default keys. This requires the attacker to know or guess the IP address of the targeted device(s) and be able to reach it over the network.
- The attacker needs to be able to attempt SSH connections to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability, that the keys are shared, and the default private keys, and also needs network access to the target devices.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability is classified with a CVSS base score of 6.8, indicating a medium severity level.
- The vulnerability is listed in the NVIDIA Security Bulletin for Jetson TX1 and TX2 L4T - April 2019.
- NVIDIA acknowledges Jesse Raffa for reporting the vulnerability.
- The fix is included in L4T R28.3 and later.
