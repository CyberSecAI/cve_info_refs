Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-5534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is that login information for virtual machines deployed from an OVF (Open Virtualization Format) can be exposed through the virtual machine's vAppConfig properties.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Credentials used to deploy a virtual machine from an OVF (typically the root account) are stored within the vAppConfig properties of the virtual machine. This data is accessible through vCenter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Exposure:** A malicious actor with the ability to query the vAppConfig properties of a virtual machine deployed from an OVF can view the stored credentials.
- **Compromise of Virtual Machine:**  The attacker can use the exposed credentials to gain unauthorized access to the virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vCenter Server to query the vAppConfig properties of a virtual machine.
- **Privileged Access:** The attacker needs sufficient privileges to query the vAppConfig properties of a virtual machine. This likely means the attacker requires a valid vCenter user with appropriate read permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **vCenter Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the vCenter Server.
- **vAppConfig Query Permissions:** The attacker must possess privileges within vCenter that allows them to query the vAppConfig properties of virtual machines.
- **Knowledge of vAppConfig:** The attacker should be aware that the vAppConfig property stores OVF deployment information, including credentials

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in VMware vCenter Server versions 6.0, 6.5, and 6.7.
- The stored credentials are only valid if the password of the deployment account on the virtual machine hasn't been changed since the OVF deployment.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" with a CVSSv3 base score of 7.7.
- The advisory recommends updating to the listed fixed versions to remediate the issue.
- A workaround is to change the password of the deployment account on the virtual machine after the OVF deployment.
