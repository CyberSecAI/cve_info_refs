{
  "CVE-2019-5544": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ProcessSrvRqst() function within slpd_process.c of OpenSLP. This can lead to remote code execution.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `result` buffer in the `ProcessSrvRqst()` function is reallocated based on the `urllen` of `SLPUrlEntry` structures. However, the subsequent `memcpy` operation uses the `opaquelen`, which may be larger than the allocated buffer size, causing a heap overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow due to inconsistent length checks.",
         "Unvalidated input from network messages."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution or a crash of the slpd daemon. Memory corruption could also occur.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious actor with network access to port 427 on an ESXi host or on any Horizon DaaS management appliance may be able to overwrite the heap of the OpenSLP service.",
        "An unauthenticated attacker on the LAN can register a new service with specially crafted URLs that, when parsed during a SrvRqst message - may trigger the flaw.",
         "Network-based attacks via specially crafted SLP messages"

      ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected system on port 427, with no authentication required.",
      "affected_components": [
        "OpenSLP versions 1.2.1 and 2.0.0 (and prior)",
         "VMware ESXi and Horizon DaaS",
         "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7"
      ]
    },
    "remediation": "Upgrade to patched versions of OpenSLP or apply vendor-specific patches for affected products. Disabling the SLP service is also a workaround.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was reported by the 360Vulcan team during the 2019 Tianfu Cup Pwn Contest. Red Hat has assigned a 'Critical' severity rating to this flaw. Gentoo has discontinued support for OpenSLP, recommending users unmerge the package. VMware has provided patches for ESXi 6.0, 6.5 and 6.7. and a workaround."
