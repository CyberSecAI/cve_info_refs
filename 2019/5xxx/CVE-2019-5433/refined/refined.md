Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-5433:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of the `return_url` GET parameter in the `/www/admin/account-switch.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Open Redirect (CWE-601):** The application fails to validate the provided URL before redirecting the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can trick a logged-in user into opening a specially crafted link.
*   The user will be redirected to an attacker-controlled destination.
*   This could be used for phishing attacks, or to redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious `return_url` parameter.
*   The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user to click this link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   They need to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   They need to get a logged-in user to click on the crafted link.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Revive Adserver versions prior to 4.2.0.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `return_url` parameter to prevent redirection to arbitrary URLs. Specifically, the fix ensures that the return URL starts with the admin URL of the application. It also prevents redirection back to the `account-switch.php` page itself.
