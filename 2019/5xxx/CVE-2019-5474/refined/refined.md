Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-5474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An authorization issue exists in how GitLab handles merge request approval rules. Specifically, the system fails to properly enforce project-level settings that prevent developers from overriding approvers and approval requirements per merge request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Authorization Control:** Project owners can configure settings to prevent overriding of approvers and approvals per merge request, however, these settings can be bypassed by users with the 'Developer' role
- **Missing Input Validation:** When editing a merge request, a 'Developer' can add new approval rules by appending specific parameters to the request, effectively bypassing the project-level settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Override of Approval Rules:** Attackers (users with the 'Developer' role) can create custom approval rules, despite project settings preventing such changes. This allows developers to override approval rules set by project owners
- **Bypass of Security Controls:**  By overriding the approval rules, developers can potentially introduce malicious changes into the codebase that would otherwise be blocked by the configured approval requirements.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a specific HTTP POST request to modify a merge request. By adding parameters `merge_request[approval_rules_attributes][][name]`, `merge_request[approval_rules_attributes][][user_ids][]` and `merge_request[approval_rules_attributes][][approvals_required]` to the request, a developer can create new approval rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a user with the `Developer` role in a GitLab project.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or edit merge requests.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests.

**Versions Affected:**

- GitLab EE 11.8 and later.
