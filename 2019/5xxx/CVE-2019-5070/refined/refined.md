- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization of the `PHPSESSID` parameter in HTTP requests to the login page of eFront LMS. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code into the database query, which is then executed by the application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to compromise data by reading, modifying, or deleting database information.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the login page of the eFront LMS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and doesn't require any special tools beyond a web browser. They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable eFront LMS server.
