- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The trigger tokens for CI/CD pipelines are not rotated when the ownership of a project changes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authorization issue; trigger tokens remain valid even after ownership change, allowing previous owners to impersonate new owners.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A previous maintainer/owner can use their old trigger token to create jobs in the name of the new owner, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker uses the GitLab API with the old trigger token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker was a previous maintainer or owner of the project.
    - The attacker has access to the trigger token generated when they had ownership.
    - The attacker needs to know the project ID.
