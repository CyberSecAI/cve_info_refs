  "CVE-2019-5670": {
    "Description": "NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` in which the software uses a sequential operation to read from or write to a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privileges, code execution or information disclosure.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect length value used in a sequential read/write operation to a buffer within the `DxgkDdiEscape` handler.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": [
      "Denial of service",
      "Escalation of privileges",
      "Code execution",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Attack vectors": "Local access",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access is required to exploit this vulnerability."
