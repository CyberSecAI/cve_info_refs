This section summarizes the potential impact that this security update addresses. Descriptions use CWE™, and base scores and vectors follow CVSS V3 standards.
| **CVE** | **Description** | **Base Score** | **CVSS V3 Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2019‑5665 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display driver contains a vulnerability in the 3D vision component in which the stereo service software, when opening a file, does not check for hard links. This behavior may lead to code execution, denial of service or escalation of privileges. | 8.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5666 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) create context command DDI `DxgkDdiCreateContext` in which the product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges. | 8.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5667 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiSetRootPageTable` in which the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, which may lead to code execution, denial of service or escalation of privileges. | 8.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5668 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiSubmitCommandVirtual` in which the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges. | 8.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5669 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` in which the software uses a sequential operation to read from or write to a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer, which may lead to denial of service or escalation of privileges. | 8.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5670 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler for `DxgkDdiEscape` in which the software uses a sequential operation to read from or write to a buffer, but it uses an incorrect length value that causes it to access memory that is outside of the bounds of the buffer which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privileges, code execution or information disclosure. | 7.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2019‑5671 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for DxgkDdiEscape in which the software does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, which may lead to denial of service. | 6.5 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| CVE‑2018‑6260 | NVIDIA graphics driver contains a vulnerability that may allow access to application data processed on the GPU through a side channel exposed by the GPU performance counters. Local user access is required. This vulnerability is not a network or remote attack vector. | 2.2 | [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation. NVIDIA recommends consulting a security or IT professional to evaluate the risk to your specific configuration.
