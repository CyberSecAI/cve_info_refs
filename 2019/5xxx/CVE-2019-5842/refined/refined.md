Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Use-after-free error located within the Blink rendering engine, which is part of the Google Chrome browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** This type of vulnerability occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected user's Chrome browser. This could lead to a wide range of malicious activities, such as:
    - Installation of malware
    - Data theft
    - Browser hijacking
    - System compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability within Blink when processing malicious or crafted web content.
- A successful exploit would likely involve a specially crafted web page or other malicious content that triggers the vulnerability when rendered by the Chrome browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to deliver or host malicious web content that a user would then access using a vulnerable version of Chrome.
- This could be achieved by:
    - Tricking a user into visiting a malicious website.
    - Compromising a legitimate website to inject malicious code.
    - Sending a link to the malicious content via email or other communication channels.
    - Utilizing malicious advertisements.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was reported by BUGFENSE Anonymous Bug Bounties on 2019-05-09.
