CVE-2019-5073:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The iocheckd service "I/O-Check" in WAGO PFC200 uses a function to get stdout output from tools that run as subprocesses. When a subprocess fails, the stack buffer remains uninitialized. This uninitialized stack data is then copied to the response buffer and sent over the network.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Information Exposure Through Sent Data (CWE-201). The vulnerability arises because the return value of sub_12EA0 is ignored and it is assumed that the stack buffer contains valid data, even when the external tool fails and leaves the buffer uninitialized.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can send unauthenticated packets to trigger the vulnerability, causing uninitialized stack data to be leaked. This information can be used to bypass security protections such as ASLR, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities. The type and amount of data exposed varies between firmware revisions.
  - Attack vectors: Sending specially crafted packets to the iocheckd service "I/O-Check" can cause an external tool to fail, resulting in the exposure of uninitialized stack data. There are three different messages that call the vulnerable code.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker can send unauthenticated packets to the vulnerable service. Network access to the WAGO PFC200 device is required.
  - Affected versions: WAGO PFC200 Firmware version 03.01.07(13), WAGO PFC200 Firmware version 03.00.39(12), and WAGO PFC100 Firmware version 03.00.39(12)
  - Mitigation: Disable the iocheckd service “I/O-Check” via the Web-based management web application.
