CVE-2019-5024: Capsule Technologies SmartLinx Neuron 2 restricted environment protection mechanism failure vulnerability

- Vulnerability: A restricted environment escape vulnerability exists in the "kiosk mode" function.
- Affected product: Capsule Technologies SmartLinx Neuron 2 medical information collection devices running versions 9.0.3 or lower.
- Root cause: A specific series of keyboard inputs can escape the restricted environment.
- Attack vector: An attacker can connect to the device via a USB port with a keyboard or other HID device.
- Impact: Successful exploitation results in full administrator access to the underlying operating system, potentially giving an attacker full control of a trusted device on a hospital's internal network.
- Exploit details: Entering a specific sequence of keystrokes (ALT, DOWN 6 times, ENTER, SHIFT 5 times, SHIFT-TAB, SPACE, SHIFT-TAB, SPACE, cmd.exe, ENTER) will escape the restricted environment and open an operating system command prompt with administrator privileges. A USB Rubber Ducky can also be programmed to automate this process.
- Mitigation: Apply vendor software updates (versions after 9.0.3 are not vulnerable). Restrict physical access to vulnerable devices, disable USB ports if possible, and monitor logs for unauthorized peripheral connections.
