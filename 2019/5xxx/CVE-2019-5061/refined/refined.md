- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the hostapd's implementation of the IAPP (Inter-Access Point Protocol). When a new station attempts to connect, hostapd sends an IAPP broadcast packet containing the station's MAC address to the LAN before the station has successfully authenticated. This behavior allows an attacker to send forged Authentication and Association Request packets with different MAC addresses, triggering the broadcast of IAPP updates for each.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the premature sending of IAPP location updates before the completion of the authentication process.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - CAM table attack: An attacker can send a large number of forged Authentication and Association Request packets with unique MAC addresses, causing a flood of IAPP broadcast packets. This can overwhelm the upstream network infrastructure and lead to a denial-of-service.
    - Traffic flapping: An attacker could fake already existing clients in other nearby Aps of the same wireless infrastructure, leading to traffic flapping.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be in a position to send forged Authentication and Association Request packets to the vulnerable hostapd instance. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger this vulnerability.
