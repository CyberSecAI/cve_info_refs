The provided content indicates that CVE-2019-5862 is related to a vulnerability in Chrome's AppCache. The vulnerability is described as "AppCache not robust to compromised renderers." This means a compromised renderer process can potentially exploit the AppCache mechanism.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root Cause:** The AppCache implementation is not robust against compromised renderer processes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The AppCache mechanism does not have sufficient security boundaries to prevent a compromised renderer from exploiting it.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is not specified in the provided text, but could potentially allow a compromised renderer to manipulate or access data related to the AppCache.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A compromised renderer process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have successfully compromised a renderer process to be able to exploit the vulnerability.

The content provides more detail than the CVE description by specifying the component (AppCache) and the type of weakness (not robust to compromised renderers).
