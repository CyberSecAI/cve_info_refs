# JVN#83826673 The installers of UNLHA32.DLL, UNARJ32.DLL and LHMelting may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries

## Overview

The installers of UNLHA32.DLL, UNARJ32.DLL and LHMelting provided by Micco may insecurely load Dynamic Link Libraries.

## Products Affected

* UNLHA32.DLL for Win32 Ver 2.67.1.2 and earlier (CVE-2019-5911)
* UNARJ32.DLL for Win32 Ver 1.10.1.25 and earlier (CVE-2019-5912)
* LHMelting for Win32 Ver 1.65.3.6 and earlier (CVE-2019-5913)

## Description

The installers of UNLHA32.DLL, UNARJ32.DLL and LHMelting provided by Micco use the old version of Self-Extracting Archives created by UNLHA32.DLL.

They contain an issue with the DLL search path, which may lead to insecurely loading Dynamic Link Libraries ([CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html), [CVE-2018-16189](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16189)).

## Impact

Arbitrary code may be executed with the privilege of the user invoking the installer.

## Solution

**Use the latest installer and update the Software**

Use the latest installer according to the information provided by the developer.

When installing products, be sure to check there are no suspicious files in the directory where the installer resides.

Note that this vulnerability affects the installers only, and the latest version of DLLs contain fixes for the other vulnerability ([CVE-2018-16190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16190)).
