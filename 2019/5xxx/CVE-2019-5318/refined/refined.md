- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface for RAPConsole lacks Anti-CSRF protections for state-changing operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially reboot the affected device if they can convince a user to visit a specially crafted web page.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious web page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote, but they need the victim to interact with their malicious page.
