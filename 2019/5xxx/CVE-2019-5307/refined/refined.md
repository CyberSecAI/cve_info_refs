- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a less strict check on the NAS message sequence number (SN), specifically the NAS COUNT, in some Huawei 4G LTE devices. This relaxed check is implemented for better compatibility.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of NAS message sequence numbers, which enables message replay attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to:
    - Tamper with Globally Unique Temporary Identities (GUTIs) by replaying GUTI reallocation command messages.
    - Obtain International Mobile Subscriber Identities (IMSIs) by replaying Identity request messages.
    - Data services are unavailable after users access the rogue base station.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by:
    - Constructing a rogue base station.
    - Luring victims to connect to the rogue base station.
    - Replaying specific NAS messages (GUTI reallocation or Identity request messages).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to construct a rogue base station.
    - Proximity to the target devices to lure them to connect to the rogue base station.
    - Knowledge of specific NAS messages that can be replayed to cause the desired impact.
