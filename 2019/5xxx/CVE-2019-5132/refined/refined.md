The content is related to CVE-2019-5132.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the igcore19d.dll GEM Raster parser of the Accusoft ImageGear 19.3.0 library. A specially crafted GEM file can cause an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write due to a loop counter and buffer size being derived from attacker-controlled values within the GEM file. Specifically, the `memcpy` operation within a loop copies data to a destination buffer, where the size of the copy (`size_1`) and the loop count (`counter`) are controlled by the attacker, leading to writing past the buffer's boundaries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution. An attacker can cause memory corruption leading to remote code execution by writing arbitrary data outside the allocated buffer by controlling the loop count and data size.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted GEM file needs to be provided to the victim. The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses this malformed file, which occurs when loading the GEM file via the `IG_load_file` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious GEM file to the victim.
