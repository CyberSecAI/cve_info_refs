- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically within the `dir` parameter of the `/appCore/ajax.adm_server.php` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exfiltrate the database, including user credentials and potentially gain access to the underlying operating system depending on configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/appCore/ajax.adm_server.php` endpoint with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `dir` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
