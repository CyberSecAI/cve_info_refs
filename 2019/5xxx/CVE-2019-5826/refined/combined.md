# sanitizers

This project is the home for Sanitizers: AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, ThreadSanitizer, LeakSanitizer, and more
The actual code resides in the [LLVM](http://llvm.org) repository.
Here we keep extended [documentation](/google/sanitizers/wiki), [bugfixes](/google/sanitizers/issues) and some helper code.

The documentation for our tools:

* [AddressSanitizer](/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) (detects addressability issues) and [LeakSanitizer](/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer) (detects memory leaks)
* ThreadSanitizer (detects data races and deadlocks) for [C++](/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual) and [Go](/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerGoManual)
* [MemorySanitizer](/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer) (detects use of uninitialized memory)
* [HWASAN](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html), or Hardware-assisted AddressSanitizer, a newer variant of AddressSanitizer that consumes much less memory
* [UBSan](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html), or UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer

Some of the sanitizers are also available for different OS Kernels:

* [KASAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/dev-tools/kasan.html)
* [KMSAN](https://github.com/google/kmsan)
* [KCSAN](https://github.com/google/kernel-sanitizers/blob/master/KCSAN.md)

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update for Desktop](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_30.html "Stable Channel Update for Desktop")

Tuesday, April 30, 2019

The stable channel has been updated to 74.0.3729.131 for Windows, Mac, and Linux, which will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

Security Fixes and Rewards
Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.

This update includes [2](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+os%3DAndroid%2Cios%2Clinux%2Cmac%2Cwindows%2Call+label%3ARelease-1-M74) security fixes. security fixes. Below, we highlight fixes that were contributed by external researchers. Please see the [Chrome Security Page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

* [$500][[952406](https://crbug.com/952406)] High CVE-2019-5827: Out-of-bounds access in SQLite. *Reported by mlfbrown on 2019-04-12*
* [$TBD][[948564](https://crbug.com/948564)] Medium CVE-2019-5824: Parameter passing error in media player. *Reported by leecraso and Guang Gong of Alpha Team, Qihoo 360 on 2019-04-02*

We would also like to thank all security researchers that worked with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel.

The following bugs were fixed in previous Chrome releases, but were mistakenly omitted from the release notes at the time:

* [$25,633.70][[941624](https://crbug.com/941624)] Out-of-bounds write and use-after-free. *Reported by Gengming Liu, Jianyu Chen, Zhen Feng, Jessica Liu at Tencent Keen Security Lab on 2019-03-13:*

+ [[941743](https://crbug.com/941743)] High CVE-2019-5825: Out-of-bounds write in V8
+ [[941746](https://crbug.com/941746)] High CVE-2019-5826: Use-after-free in IndexedDB

Many of our security bugs are detected using [AddressSanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer), [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer), [UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer](https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/undefinedbehaviorsanitizer), [Control Flow Integrity](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/control-flow-integrity), [libFuzzer](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/testing/libfuzzer), or [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/).

A list of all changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/74.0.3729.108..74.0.3729.131?pretty=fuller&n=10000). Interested in switching release channels?  [Find out how](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel). If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](https://crbug.com/). The [community help forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chrome) is also a great place to reach out for help or learn about common issues.
