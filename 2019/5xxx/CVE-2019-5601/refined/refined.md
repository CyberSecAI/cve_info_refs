RELATED: CVE-2019-5601

Vulnerability: Kernel stack disclosure in UFS/FFS.

Root Cause: A bug causes up to three bytes of kernel stack memory to be written to disk as uninitialized directory entry padding. A malicious user with write access to a directory can cause up to 254 bytes of kernel stack memory to be exposed.

Weakness: The UFS/FFS filesystem writes kernel stack memory to disk as uninitialized directory entry padding.

Impact: Disclosure of kernel stack memory to users with read access to the directory.

Attack vector: A malicious user with write access to a directory can cause up to 254 bytes of kernel stack memory to be exposed.

Required capabilities: Read access to the directory is required to view the disclosed data. Write access to a directory is required to expose up to 254 bytes of kernel stack memory.
