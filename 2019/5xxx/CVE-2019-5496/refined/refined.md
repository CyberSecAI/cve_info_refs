Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of certain HTTP security headers configured in OnCommand Insight versions prior to 7.3.5.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the absence of appropriate HTTP security headers, which can leave the application susceptible to various attacks that rely on exploiting missing headers. The specific missing headers are not mentioned in the advisory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The exact nature of the sensitive information is not specified.

**Attack Vectors:**
The advisory mentions that the vulnerability could be exploited via unspecified vectors. This indicates that the missing headers could potentially be exploited in multiple ways.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The advisory states a CVSS score with the following vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N. This translates to:
-   **AV:N (Network):** The attack can be performed over the network.
-   **AC:L (Low):** The attack requires low complexity.
-   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to perform the attack.
-   **UI:N (None):** No user interaction is needed to perform the attack.
-   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability does not affect other components or systems.
-   **C:L (Low):** There is low impact on confidentiality.
-  **I:L (Low):** There is low impact on integrity
- **A:N (None):** There is no impact on availability

This suggests that a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing specific privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides a link to a Qualys Community thread related to HTTP security headers, which may offer more insight into the types of headers that might be missing and their potential impact.
- The advisory lists numerous products that are *not* affected by the vulnerability.
