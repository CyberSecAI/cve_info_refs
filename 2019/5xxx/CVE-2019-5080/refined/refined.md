- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iocheckd service "I/O-Check" functionality in WAGO PFC200 devices lacks proper authentication, allowing an attacker to send an unauthenticated packet that triggers a factory reset.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for a critical function (factory reset).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service (the CODESYS runtime is stopped).
    - Credentials weakening: The device reverts to default, well-known credentials for Linux and lighthttpd users, which are used to access the device's web server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an unauthenticated packet using the iocheckd protocol to trigger the factory reset.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can be unauthenticated, and no special position is needed, only access to the network.
