- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `user_id` parameter in the `/objects/subscribeNotify.json.php` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  SQL injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access sensitive information such as usernames and password hashes from the database. This may also lead to exfiltration of the database and, in certain configurations, access to the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted web request to `/objects/subscribeNotify.json.php` with a malicious SQL payload within the `user_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
