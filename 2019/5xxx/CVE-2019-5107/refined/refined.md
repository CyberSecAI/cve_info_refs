CVE-2019-5107: WAGO e!Cockpit network communication cleartext transmission vulnerability

- Root cause: Network traffic does not utilize encryption for any communication. Sensitive information is transferred over the network, both locally to the GatewayService, as well as remotely to the PLC itself.
- Weakness: Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319)
- Impact: An attacker with access to network traffic can easily intercept, interpret, and manipulate data coming from, or destined for e!Cockpit. This includes passwords, configurations, and binaries being transferred to endpoints.
- Attack vector: An attacker locally, or anywhere between the end device and the programming software can listen to manipulate or drop any information they choose to.
- Required attacker capabilities: Access to network traffic.
