- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to unbounded recursion and improper handling of nesting depth in the `print-tlv` command of the Weave tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) in the `DumpHandler` function when processing nested TLV structures. The `strncpy` function is used to write to a fixed-size buffer (`tabbuf`) based on the nesting depth without limiting the depth, leading to out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Code execution due to stack corruption.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - An attacker can craft a malicious Weave TLV with a deeply nested structure.
  - The attacker needs to convince a user to open this specially crafted Weave command using the `weave print-tlv` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - Ability to create a malicious Weave TLV file.
  - Ability to convince the user to execute the `weave print-tlv` command with the malicious file.
