      "content": "The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5506.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Clustered Data ONTAP versions 9.0 and higher do not enforce hostname verification under certain circumstances.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of hostname verification leading to susceptibility to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Exploitation could lead to MITM attacks by intercepting and potentially modifying data configured using the 'system node virtual-machine hypervisor' command. This command is specific to virtualized platforms like ONTAP Select and not supported on hardware-based systems.\n\nAttack vectors: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the virtualized ONTAP system and its hypervisor, or other systems it communicates with when using the vulnerable command. There is no need for the attacker to have credentials."
