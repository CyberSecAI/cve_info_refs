- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, leading to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `base64Url` parameter in `/objects/getImageMP4.php` is vulnerable to command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could lead to exfiltration of the database, user credentials, or full compromise of the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted web request to `/objects/getImageMP4.php` with a malicious `base64Url` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted web request.
