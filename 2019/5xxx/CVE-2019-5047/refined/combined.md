# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0816

## NitroPDF CharProcs Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

##### October 9, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5047

### Summary

An exploitable Use After Free vulnerability exists in the CharProcs parsing functionality of NitroPDF. A specially crafted PDF can cause a type confusion, resulting in a Use After Free. An attacker can craft a malicious PDF to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

NitroPDF 12.2.1.522

### Product URLs

<https://www.gonitro.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-416: Use After Free

### Details

NitroPDF is a popular PDF tool used to create and edit PDF files. NitroPDF has a wide array of features for automated PDF creation as well as reviewing differences between various PDFs.

The module tested for this advisory is below:

```
00007ffb`eb750000 00007ffb`ec559000   npdf       (export symbols)       npdf.dll
    Loaded symbol image file: npdf.dll
    Image path: C:\Program Files\Nitro\Pro\12\npdf.dll
    Image name: npdf.dll
    Browse all global symbols  functions  data
    Timestamp:        Tue Mar 26 15:48:15 2019 (5C9A900F)
    CheckSum:         00D05033
    ImageSize:        00E09000
    File version:     12.12.1.522
    Product version:  12.12.1.522

```

PDF Font Objects have a variety of attributes. One of which is the CharProcs. This attribute points to a dictionary of content streams that tells the renderer how to render the glyph for the given character. In particular, the content stream must have a `d0` or `d1` operator as it’s first operator, followed by a series of other graphics objects. An example of how these CharProcs are used is below:

```
11 0 obj
<< /Length 39 >>
stream
1000 0 0 0 750 750 d1
0 0 750 750 re
f
endstream
endobj

12 0 obj
<<
/Type /Font
/Subtype /Type3
/FontBBox [0 0 750 750]
/FontMatrix [0.001 0 0 0.061 0 0]
/CharProcs 16 0 R
/Encoding 17 0 R
/FirstChar 97
/LastChar 98
/Widths [0 0]
>>
endobj

16 0 obj
<<
    /square 11 0 R
>>
endobj

```

Above we see a `CharProcs` object point to the object referenced at `16 0`. This object contains a square pointing to the object referenced at `11 0`. This object contains the content stream for the square glyph.

There are a variety of other objects valid for a PDF with their own set of valid content streams. One example is the Text object. The Text object can contain a content stream with information on how to position text in the document. An example of a Text object is shown below:

```
22 0 obj
<<
/Length 39>>
stream
BT
/F1 12 Tf
50 685 Tr
(a) Tj
ET
endstream
endobj

```

The parser is expecting the `CharProcs` content stream to contain valid instructions on how to paint the glyph. If an attacker replaces the `CharProcs` content stream for a particular Text object content stream, a buffer is allocated for a TypeFont.

```
npdf+0x19bb26
local_RAX_38 = operator_new(0x2e0);
if (local_RAX_38 == 0x0) {
	type_font = 0x0;
}
else {
	type_font = zero_obj(local_RAX_38);
}
local_18 = type_font;
init_obj(type_font, &pdf_page_viewer->field_0xc0);

```

When creating another TypeFont for the larger PageViewer object, this buffer is freed.

```
npdf+0x19c272
frees_buffer(page_viewer);
pTVar4 = operator_new(0x2e0);
if (pTVar4 == 0x0) {
	pTVar4 = 0x0;
}
else {
	pTVar4 = zero_obj(pTVar4);
}
local_40 = pTVar4;
init_obj(pTVar4, page_viewer->field_0xc0);

```

A handle to the original freed buffer still exists in the overarching PageViewer object. This original buffer is later passed as a parameter in a functioned called by the parent function. This buffer being reused to read data that should be from the original TypeFont causes a use after free, potentially resulting in code execution.

### Crash Information

```
(455c.aa8): Access violation - code c0000005 (first/second chance not available)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
