The provided content is related to CVE-2019-5102.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `ustream-ssl` library used by OpenWrt, specifically when using `mbed TLS` (package `libustream-mbedtls`). The `__ustream_ssl_connect` function returns `U_SSL_OK` after the handshake, without properly checking the validity of the server's certificate. The function `ustream_ssl_verify_cert` is called, but the return value of `ustream_ssl_verify_cert` is not checked, and the connection is considered established regardless of certificate validity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper certificate validation: The `ustream-ssl` library does not enforce proper verification of the server's SSL certificate when using `mbed TLS`.
- Premature connection establishment: The connection is considered established, and pending writes are executed, before proper certificate verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leak: An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, providing a malicious or invalid certificate. Due to the lack of verification, the client will send its data (e.g., HTTP request), which the attacker can then intercept and steal.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: The attacker must be positioned between the vulnerable OpenWrt device and the server it is connecting to.
- The attacker intercepts the clientâ€™s connection and presents their own certificate (which may be self-signed or invalid).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable OpenWrt device and the server it intends to communicate with.
- No special privileges are required on the OpenWrt device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenWrt versions 18.06.4 and 15.05.1 when using the `libustream-mbedtls` package.
- This report includes details of the vulnerability including specific code snippets.
- The report also references CVE-2019-5101 which is a similar vulnerability, but when using `OpenSSL`.
