Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `categories_id` parameter within the `/objects/videoAddNew.json.php` endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application constructs SQL queries using unsanitized input from the `categories_id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, password hashes, and other potentially sensitive data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database configuration and the specific injected SQL, attackers could potentially gain elevated privileges within the database.
*   **Operating System Access (in certain configurations):** The report mentions that in certain configurations, exploitation could lead to access to the underlying operating system. (This is not explained in further detail, but is a potential higher impact).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/objects/videoAddNew.json.php` endpoint.
*   **`categories_id` Parameter:** The SQL injection payload is inserted into the `categories_id` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint. This indicates that the attacker needs to have a valid user account within the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was confirmed in YouPHPTube versions 6.2 and 7.6.
*   The vulnerability was patched by the vendor on 2019-10-16
*   The `CVSSv3` score of 7.4 indicates a high severity vulnerability.
*   The provided example request shows how to inject SQL in the `categories_id` parameter, along with other required parameters, indicating that the vulnerability exists within a larger form or data submission process.
