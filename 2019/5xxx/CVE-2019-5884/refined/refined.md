Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5884:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how elFinder's PHP connector handles remote file retrieval when the PHP curl extension is enabled and `safe_mode` or `open_basedir` are not set. Specifically, the `get_remote_contents` function uses curl_exec to fetch remote content. When the curl extension is available and safe mode / open_basedir are not set, the function doesn't properly restrict the URLs that curl can access. This allows for potentially malicious URLs to be accessed by the application, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted URL Access:** The `curl_get_contents` function, when used, allows the application to fetch content from arbitrary URLs without proper validation or restriction.
*   **Information Leakage:** The core vulnerability is an information leakage issue, as the server might be tricked into accessing and potentially revealing sensitive data from internal resources or external services.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data from internal servers or services that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This could include configuration files, internal documentation, or other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious URL that elFinder will process.
*   The attacker would need to find an elFinder instance where the PHP curl extension is enabled and neither `safe_mode` nor `open_basedir` are set.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be positioned remotely and doesn't need any prior access or privileges to the system.
*   **Knowledge of elFinder:** The attacker needs to know that the target system is running a vulnerable version of elFinder and have some understanding of its API.
*   **Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL that, when processed by elFinder, will trigger the information disclosure vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to elFinder versions prior to 2.1.45.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in commit `f133163` and included in release 2.1.45.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ravindra Rajaram and Hamsalekha Madiraju.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.9, with High confidentiality impact and no Integrity or Availability impact.
