- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VeloCloud Orchestrator parameter authorization check incorrectly allows enterprise users to access information belonging to Managed Service Provider (MSP) accounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to flawed authorization checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated enterprise user can retrieve sensitive information of MSP accounts, including usernames, first and last names, phone numbers, and email addresses (if available). No other personal data is exposed.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated enterprise user can exploit the vulnerability via the VeloCloud Orchestrator interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated enterprise user of the VeloCloud Orchestrator.
