- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of the `base64Url` parameter in the `/objects/getSpiritsFromVideo.php` file leads to OS command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `base64Url` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to exfiltration of sensitive data (database, credentials) and full compromise of the underlying operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted GET request with a malicious payload in the `base64Url` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint `/objects/getSpiritsFromVideo.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication and can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
