- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Lack of input validation in some Huawei smartphones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  An application installed by a user with root privileges can read process information due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could read some process information, leading to sensitive information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker must trick a user with root privileges to install a malicious application on the smartphone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to convince a user with root privileges to install a crafted application. The user must have root privileges on the device for the attack to work.
