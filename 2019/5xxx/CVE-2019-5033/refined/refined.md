- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the Number record parser of Aspose.Cells for C++ library. The vulnerability occurs because a malformed array index value is read directly from the file and used later without any sanitization, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Out-of-bounds read: A crafted XLS file with a malformed index in the `Number` record leads to reading memory outside the bounds of an allocated array.
    - Lack of input sanitization: The index value read from the file is used directly as an array index without proper validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. By triggering the out-of-bounds read, the attacker can corrupt function pointers or return addresses, redirecting code execution to an arbitrary address.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted malicious XLS file using the vulnerable Aspose.Cells library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malformed XLS file to the victim. No specific network access or privileged position is required.
