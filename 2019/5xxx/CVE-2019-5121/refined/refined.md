Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `/objects/pluginSwitch.json.php` endpoint through the `uuid`, `name`, and `dir` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Access sensitive information stored in the database, such as usernames and password hashes.
    *   Potentially gain access to the underlying operating system (in certain configurations, though not fully elaborated upon).
    *   Exfiltrate data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted web requests to the `/objects/pluginSwitch.json.php` endpoint.
*   Specifically, the attacker injects SQL code into the `uuid`, `name`, or `dir` parameters via a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The provided request examples include a session cookie, `user` cookie, and `pass` cookie.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
