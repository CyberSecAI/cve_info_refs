Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The iChain Insurance Wallet App for iOS used an outdated version of the `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` plugin. This older version contained a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The application is susceptible to path traversal attacks due to the vulnerable `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` plugin. This allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended application directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially obtain arbitrary files from the iOS device, including those related to the application. This can lead to the leakage of sensitive information contained in those files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (Remote):** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network access.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires some user interaction, likely to trigger the vulnerable code or process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to induce the user to perform an action that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.4.0 of the iChain Insurance Wallet App for iOS by updating to a patched version of the `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` plugin (version 2.2.0 or later).
*   The Android version of the application was not affected by this vulnerability.
*   The provided information is consistent with the description of CVE-2018-16202, which is also mentioned as the root cause of this vulnerability.

This analysis aligns with the provided descriptions of CVE-2019-5923, which is related to a directory traversal vulnerability within the iChain Insurance Wallet App.
