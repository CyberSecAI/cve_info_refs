# Advisory Details

April 17th, 2019
## (Pwn2Own) VMware Workstation UHCI Out-Of-Bounds Access Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-19-421ZDI-CAN-8372

| CVE ID | [CVE-2019-5518](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-5518) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Workstation |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of data sent to UHCI endpoints. Crafted data sent to UHCI endpoints can trigger a memory access past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | VMware has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

##### 1. Summary

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion updates address multiple security issues.

#####

##### 2. Relevant Products

* VMware vSphere ESXi (ESXi)
* VMware Workstation Pro / Player (Workstation)
* VMware Fusion Pro / Fusion (Fusion)

#####

##### 3. Problem Description

**a. VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion UHCI out-of-bounds read/write and TOCTOU vulnerabilities**

VMware ESXi, Workstation and Fusion contain an out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability and a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in the virtual USB 1.1 UHCI (Universal Host Controller Interface). Exploitation of these issues requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with a virtual USB controller present. These issues may allow a guest to execute code on the host.

In ESXi, Workstation and Fusion, when a virtual USB 2.0 controller is added to a VM, a virtual USB 1.1 controller is also added by default. In Workstation and Fusion, when a virtual USB 3.0 controller is added to a VM, a virtual USB 1.1 controller is also added by default.

VMware would like to thank the Fluoroacetate team of Amat Cama and Richard Zhu, working with the Pwn2Own 2019 Security Contest, for reporting these issues to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifiers CVE-2019-5518 (out-of-bounds read/write) and CVE-2019-5519 (TOCTOU) to these issues.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**b. VMware Workstation and Fusion out-of-bounds write vulnerability in e1000 virtual network adapter**

VMware Workstation and Fusion contain an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the e1000 virtual network adapter. This issue may allow a guest to execute code on the host.

VMware would like to thank security researcher Zhangyanyu of Chaitin Tech for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2019-5524 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**c. VMware Workstation and Fusion out-of-bounds write vulnerability in e1000 and e1000e virtual network adapters**

VMware Workstation and Fusion updates address an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the e1000 and e1000e virtual network adapters. Exploitation of this issue may lead to code execution on the host from the guest but it is more likely to result in a denial of service of the guest.

VMware would like to thank instructor working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2019-5515 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

**d. VMware Fusion unauthenticated APIs Security vulnerability**

VMware Fusion contains a security vulnerability due to certain unauthenticated APIs accessible through a web socket. An attacker may exploit this issue by tricking the host user to execute a JavaScript to perform unauthorized functions on the guest machine where VMware Tools is installed. This may further be exploited to execute commands on the guest machines.

VMware would like to thank CodeColorist (@CodeColorist) and Csaba Fitzl (@theevilbit) for independently reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifier CVE-2019-5514 to this issue.
