Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-5518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds memory access within the processing of data sent to the Universal Host Controller Interface (UHCI) endpoints. Specifically, crafted data can trigger a memory access beyond the allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability: This allows an attacker to read or write data outside the intended memory boundaries.
- Improper handling of data sent to UHCI endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An attacker can gain elevated privileges on the host system by exploiting the vulnerability.
- Code execution: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor (host).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted data to UHCI endpoints of a virtual machine.
- The presence of a virtual USB controller is required on the target VM. This is present by default when a virtual USB 2.0 or 3.0 controller is added.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have an initial foothold on the target system, with the ability to execute low-privileged code.
- The target must be running a vulnerable version of VMware Workstation, ESXi, or Fusion with a virtual USB controller configured.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Fluoroacetate team during the Pwn2Own 2019 security contest.
- VMware has released updates to address this vulnerability.
- The advisory also mentions a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability associated with the same UHCI interface, which is tracked under CVE-2019-5519.
