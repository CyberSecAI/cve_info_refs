- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An information disclosure vulnerability existed where user information could be exposed when a user's session ended due to inactivity. This occurred because the browser's inspect feature could be used to view details available on the last page visited by the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure due to improper handling of session data on the last visited page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with remote access could potentially gain access to user information exposed via the browser's inspect feature after session inactivity.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers require remote access and the ability to inspect the last visited page's details using the browser's developer tools after a user session has ended due to inactivity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote access to the system running Nexpose, and the ability to use browser development tools.

This content provides more detail than the basic CVE description by specifying how the information disclosure occurs through the browser's inspection feature and detailing the impact and required attacker capabilities.
