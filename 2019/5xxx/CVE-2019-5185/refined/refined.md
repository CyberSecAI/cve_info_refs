The content is related to CVE-2019-5185.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `iocheckd` service "I/O-Check" functionality when parsing a specially crafted XML cache file (`/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`). Specifically, the `state` parameter is not properly validated, leading to an overflow when copied using `sprintf` into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. This overflow corrupts adjacent stack memory, ultimately leading to a crash when `strcpy` is used to copy the overflowed content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `sprintf` function copies a string into a fixed-size stack buffer without checking the length, causing a buffer overflow when the input string is too large.
- Missing input validation: The `state` parameter in the XML file is not validated for length, allowing for arbitrarily long strings to be processed by sprintf.
- Lack of NULL termination: Because the stack buffer is overflowed, no NULL terminator is present when strcpy is later used, causing strcpy to read beyond buffer bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The overflow causes the `iocheckd` service to crash, preventing the affected messages from functioning correctly.
- Potential code execution: While not immediately demonstrated, the report mentions that depending on compiler and optimization settings, this vulnerability *could* result in code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious XML file: An attacker must place a malicious XML file at `/tmp/iocheckCache.xml`. Since all users have write access to /tmp, this can be achieved by any user on the system, including a low-privileged user.
- Trigger message: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a `BC_SaveParameter` message to the `iocheckd` service, which forces the parsing of the malicious XML file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to write to the `/tmp` directory of the device, which is accessible to any user.
- Ability to send network messages to the `iocheckd` service to trigger the parsing of the crafted XML cache file.

The report also mentions a related vulnerability (CVE-2019-5186) involving the `interface` parameter which uses the same vulnerable code pattern. Both vulnerabilities are described with the same attack vector, root cause, weaknesses, and impact.
