Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5971:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Attendance Manager" is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. This means that an attacker can potentially trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions within the plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:** If a user with administrative privileges is tricked into viewing a malicious page while logged in, the attacker can cause unintended operations to be performed. This could include modifying settings, adding/deleting data or potentially other administrative tasks depending on what actions the vulnerable plugin allows.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would need to craft a malicious webpage or link that, when clicked by a logged-in administrator, sends a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The attack relies on tricking an authenticated user (with admin privileges) into triggering the malicious request. The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious page or embed the malicious request in a different context which the targeted user will interact with.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Attendance Manager versions 0.5.6 and earlier.
