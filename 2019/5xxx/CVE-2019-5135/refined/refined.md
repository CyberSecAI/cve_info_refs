Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the PHP `crypt()` function for password hash comparison within the `PasswordCorrect()` function in the `login.php` file of the WAGO PFC100/200 Web-Based Management (WBM) application. The `crypt()` function's execution time varies depending on the input. This timing discrepancy is exploitable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Timing Discrepancy:** The primary weakness is the timing difference in the execution of `crypt()` based on input, which can be measured by an attacker through HTTP response times.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The password provided in the HTTP POST request is passed directly to the `crypt()` function without any validation or filtering, enabling the attacker to increase the processing time of `crypt()`.
*   **Use of insecure `crypt()` for comparison:** The `crypt()` function, while suitable for hashing, is not designed for safe password hash comparison, as it is vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the timing discrepancy to infer characters of the salt and the hash of user credentials. This is due to the timing differences in execution of the `crypt()` function during login attempts.
*   **Reduced Resistance to Password Cracking:** By extracting the salt along with the hash, the attacker can significantly reduce the resistance of the password hashes to cracking attacks.
*   **Potential System Access:** If the WBM is configured to use system credentials ( `/etc/shadow`), a successful password cracking attack against a system user can give the attacker access to the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network requests to the WBM application.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attack can be performed without authentication.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by analyzing the HTTP response delays of various inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WAGO PFC100/200 device running the vulnerable web application.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WBM login interface.
*   **Ability to measure HTTP Response Time:** The attacker must be able to measure/analyze the response time of the web application to infer information about the password hash.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the `PasswordCorrect()` function within `login.php`.
*   The `crypt()` function is used with a salt extracted from a password file.
*   The vulnerable code is reachable by abusing regular expressions similar to TALOS-2019-0923 (CVE-2019-5134).
*   The vulnerability affects a wide range of firmware versions.
*   The vulnerability can lead to system access if the WBM is configured to use system credentials instead of lighttpd.
*   The provided mitigation is to use strong passwords and the `hash_equals()` function instead of `crypt()` for password hash comparison.
