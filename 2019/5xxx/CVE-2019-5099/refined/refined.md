- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer underflow when calculating the size of data to be copied in the CMP image parsing functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer underflow leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Potential code execution due to the heap buffer overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted CMP image file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted CMP file to the vulnerable software. User interaction is required to open the malicious file.
