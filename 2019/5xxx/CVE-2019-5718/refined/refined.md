Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-5718.

**CVE-2019-5718**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `get_t61_string` function within Wireshark's ASN.1 dissectors.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of the length of T.61 strings in ASN.1 dissectors leading to out-of-bounds reads when processing malformed packets.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) due to Wireshark crashing. An attacker can cause this crash by injecting a malformed network packet or by convincing someone to read a malicious capture file.
*   **Attack Vectors:** 
    *   Injecting a malformed packet onto the network.
    *   Convincing a user to open a malicious packet capture file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to either inject a malformed packet into the network where a vulnerable Wireshark instance is capturing traffic or the attacker must trick a user into opening a malicious packet capture file using Wireshark.  No specific privileges are required, but user interaction is needed for the latter scenario.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Wireshark versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.5 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.11.
*   The fix was implemented by adding a length check in the `get_t61_string` function, located in `epan/charsets.c`.
*   SUSE rates the severity as "moderate," while the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) gives a slightly higher CVSSv3 score of 5.5 due to potential user interaction, SUSE rates it as 5.3 with no user interaction.
*   The patch has been applied to various SUSE products and openSUSE releases, with fixed package versions provided.

In summary, CVE-2019-5718 describes a vulnerability where Wireshark's ASN.1 dissectors can crash due to an out-of-bounds read.  An attacker can trigger a DoS by supplying malformed network traffic or through tricking a user to open a malformed file.  The fix involves adding a bounds check. The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description, particularly in identifying the root cause in the function `get_t61_string` and the exact files involved in the fix.
