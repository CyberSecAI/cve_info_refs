Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-5893:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the OpenSource ERP application. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially:
    - Extract sensitive database information (e.g., database name, version).
    - Modify data within the database.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.
    - Could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted POST request to the `/db/utils/query/data.xml` endpoint. The malicious SQL code is injected within the `query` parameter of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No specific authentication is mentioned. This suggests the SQL injection is exploitable without prior authentication, or the exploit uses an existing session.
