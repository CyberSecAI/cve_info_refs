- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A remote buffer overflow vulnerability exists in some Aruba Instant Access Point (IAP).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve full compromise of the system (confidentiality, integrity, availability).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network with no prior authentication required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device. No user interaction is required for exploitation.
