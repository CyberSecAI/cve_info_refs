Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-5105

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking within the `RouterGetBlkAddresses` function of the CODESYS GatewayService. This function extracts values from a received network packet to calculate offsets for a subsequent `memcpy` operation. Specifically, the offsets are calculated based on byte 1 and byte 5 of the packet. If these offset calculations result in a negative value, due to integer underflow, this negative value is passed as the size parameter to `memcpy`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Underflow:** The offset calculation in `RouterGetBlkAddresses` can result in an integer underflow, leading to a large negative value that is passed to the size parameter of memcpy.
- **Uncontrolled `memcpy`:** The negative size value passed to `memcpy` leads to memory corruption when the `memcpy` function attempts to copy a large amount of data from a source to a destination memory location.
- **Out-of-bounds Memory Access:** The `memcpy` attempts to read from an invalid memory location due to the incorrect size, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service due to the process crashing upon triggering the vulnerability. The `memcpy` operation attempts to copy data with a negative size, leading to a crash of the GatewayService.exe process.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the provided information primarily details a DoS vulnerability, memory corruption bugs can sometimes be leveraged for more severe attacks like arbitrary code execution depending on the specific memory layout and context of the application. However, this specific case only mentions DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted network packet to a device running the CODESYS GatewayService.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network as well as locally.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target device on which the GatewayService.exe is running.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific network packet with particular values in bytes 1 and 5 to trigger the integer underflow during offset calculation.
- **Low Skill Level:** According to CODESYS, this vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with low skill.

**Affected Products:**
- All variants of CODESYS V3 products prior to version V3.5.16.10 containing the `CmpRouter` or `CmpRouterEmbedded` component are vulnerable. This includes:
    - CODESYS Control for BeagleBone
    - CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6
    - CODESYS Control for IOT2000
    - CODESYS Control for Linux
    - CODESYS Control for Linux ARM
    - CODESYS Control for PLCnext
    - CODESYS Control for PFC100
    - CODESYS Control for PFC200
    - CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi
    - CODESYS Control for WAGO Touch Panels 600
    - CODESYS Control RTE V3
    - CODESYS Control RTE V3 (for Beckhoff CX)
    - CODESYS Control Win V3
    - CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit
    - CODESYS V3 Embedded Target Visu Toolkit
    - CODESYS V3 Remote Target Visu Toolkit
    - CODESYS V3 Safety SIL2
    - CODESYS Edge Gateway V3
    - CODESYS Gateway V3
    - CODESYS HMI V3
    - CODESYS OPC Server V3
    - CODESYS PLCHandler SDK
    - CODESYS V3 Simulation Runtime

**Mitigation:**
- **Update to V3.5.16.10 or Later:** The recommended mitigation is to update all affected CODESYS products to version V3.5.16.10 or later which contains a fix for the vulnerability.
- **Network Segmentation:** Using firewalls to protect and separate control systems from other networks can help minimize the attack surface.
- **VPN for Remote Access:** If remote access is needed, using VPN tunnels is recommended.
- **Strong Authentication:** Implement user management and password features, restricting access to control and development systems.

**Additional Notes:**
- A public Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit is available.
- The vulnerability was independently reported by Carl Hurd of Cisco Talos, Gao Jian of NSFOCUS, and an OEM customer.
- The initial fix in version V3.5.15.40 was incomplete. Updating to V3.5.16.10 is necessary even if V3.5.15.40 was previously applied.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer) by Talos and CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read) by CODESYS. Although they refer to slightly different aspects of the bug, both are related to improper memory access.
