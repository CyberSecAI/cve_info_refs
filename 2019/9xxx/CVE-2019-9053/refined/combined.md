An experienced web developer who has been using Wordpress for a few years asked me to convince her why she should be using CMSMS. Even though she is a capable coder, projects were taking too much time. Mainly because WordPress was making it harder than necessary. So I told her...

 Posted: March 6, 2019 by calguy1000

Hi Everybody!

Today we are announcing the release of CMS Made Simple v2.2.10 - Spuzzum. This is a security and stability release. We have fixed some relatively important security vulnerabilities, and fixed some long standing issues.

More specifically:

1. An SQL injection vulnerability in the default action was fixed. This is the primary, critical reason for this release.
2. The ModuleManager received some bug fixes when installing a module that had numerous dependencies. And a minor object insertion vulnerability.
3. A couple of minor authenticated security vulnerabilities were fixed in the core and the FilePicker module. Additionally some minor fixes to the file cache driver, and IP address detection.

The standard review has been performed by members of the dev team to help ensure that no critical issues were introduced into this release.

Because of the resolved security vulnerabilities, Particularly in the News mdoule, it is important that you update your installations to CMSMS 2.2.10 at your earliest convenience.

As of this release, and according to the support policy. The CMSMS Dev team now only supports CMSMS 2.2.9 and CMSMS 2.2.10.

Thank you, and have a nice day.

| | | | | [CMS Made Simple](http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/) | | --- |  | Hello again from the CMS Made Simple Dev Team. Lots to talk about this time!  In this newsletter we are bringing you a note about the new version of CMS Made Simple released recently, some updates from the Dev Team including our change to a non-profit corporation. Also, if you have ever had to deal with content posted into CMS Made Simple from Microsoft Word, you will appreciate our pre- and post-filters article.   2.2.10 Released   We have just [released](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/downloads/cmsms) version 2.2.10, "Spuzzum". Recent updates have included numerous incremental fixes and updates. The core now operates properly in PHP 7.2, and has some improvements to the way modules are initialized when they are loaded. The latest jump to 2.2.10 is to fix a vulnerability and fix some bugs in ModuleManager, amongst other things. Please see the [blog post](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/2019/03/Announcing-CMS-Made-Simple-v2.2.10-Spuzzum) for full details.  *Fun fact:* The settlement of "Spuzzum" is in British Columbia, Canada. It is on the Trans-Canada Highway and is 50km north of the community of Hope. Hence Spuzzum is sometimes referred to as "beyond Hope"! Talking of names...   Naming Conventions   In the 1.x series, CMSMS releases were named for tropical islands, tying in to our palm tree logo and theme. When it was time to discuss a naming theme for the 2.x series, we wanted to explore more of the globe -- especially countries where many of our users and Dev Team called home. We decided that each major point release would be a new country, with each minor release a city or town in said country. There's no official process for choosing a country or town, other than the countries should be alphabetical. The developer cutting the release gets to choose the town, and often goes for a fun or obscure place.   What the Dev Team Has Been Up To   **Forge 2.0** This has been a long time coming, but we're really excited by it. Robert, our lead developer, has put in countless hours to completely rewrite the Forge (our file-release and bug tracker platform) from the ground up.  **Non Profit** In the Autumn of 2018, CMS Made Simple became a non-profit corporation, registered in Canada.  **Major Release 2.3** CMS Made Simple version 2.3 will include more features, a sleeker core, admin theme improvements, and much more.  **Slack** After fifteen years, we have retired our IRC channel and have migrated to Slack.  **GSuite** Another benefit of being a non-profit is free access to many Google products. In January we transitioned all of our mail services and groups over to GSuite.  Read more about all these improvements in [our news update blog post](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/The-CMS-Made-Simple-News-Update-February-2019/).   Smarty Pre- and Post-filters   *Guest post from our Project Manager, Matt Hornsby*  While upgrading some old 1.x websites recently I encountered a couple of problems that needed a quick and simple solution. Like most things related to CMS Made Simple, there are many ways to tackle a problem, but I thought this would be a fun opportunity to look into Smarty pre- and post-filters.  **Problem 1: Content pasted from Microsoft Word**  When an editor pastes in content from Word without cleaning it up first, it often includes a lot of extra formatting code. For this particular client, the code included curly braces "{mso-style-name:..." in hundreds of pages. Certainly I could have done a database find & replace, but why not try something different this time?.....  Read how Matt solves these issues in our [filters blog post](https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/2019/02/Developers-Corner-Smarty-Pre-and-Post-filters-By-Matt-Hornsby/).   Sponsor Highlight Aire Libre  Established in 2009, Aire Libre is a small French web company focused on providing efficient and easy to manage websites to its small-to-mid-sized business clients.  *"We chose CMS Made Simple for its great admin panel for the end user, and the flexibility of Smarty which allows us to create designs without any constraint. Our 100+ editors using it are really happy with it!"*  - Mathieu Muths, [Aire Libre](https://www.airelibre.net/)    Does your business utilize CMS Made Simple, or just want to support open source in general?

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
