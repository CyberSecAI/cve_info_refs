The provided content includes two separate pieces: a blog archive from about.gitlab.com and a GitLab issue report. Only the issue report is relevant to a potential security vulnerability.

Based on the issue report, here's the breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The GitLab instance's behavior when attempting to clone a non-existent repository is different from its behavior when attempting to clone an existing private repository. This behavior can reveal whether a private repository exists even if the user doesn't have permission to access it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: GitLab discloses the existence of a private repository by providing different error messages when a non-existent repo vs an existing private repo is attempted to be cloned.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can enumerate the existence of private repositories, even without having access to them. This information could be used to target specific repositories.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `git clone` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to use `git clone` against the GitLab instance and be able to distinguish the error messages returned when attempting to clone a non-existent repository vs an existing private one. They do not need to have any special access to GitLab.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue report explicitly mentions that this vulnerability is present on `gitlab.com`
- The suggested fix is that the error messages should behave like Github, where the error message is the same for both a non-existent and existing-but-unaccessible repository.
- This vulnerability is fixed in later releases as per the CVE description "The vulnerability was resolved in GitLab version 11.7.6, 11.8.5, 11.9.3, and 11.10".
