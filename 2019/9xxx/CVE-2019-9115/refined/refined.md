Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-9115:

**Content Analysis:**

The provided GitHub issue titled "utils.js security #60" from the `irisnet/irisnet-crypto` repository discusses a potential security vulnerability in the `utils.js` file. Specifically, line 21 of the file uses `eval`, which could be exploited to execute malicious code.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The use of the `eval()` function in the `utils.js` file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The `eval()` function takes a string as input and executes it as JavaScript code. If the string comes from an untrusted source (e.g., user input), it can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, leading to various attacks.
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the server or client-side depending on where the `utils.js` is being used, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through the input to the `eval()` function. The specific method would depend on how the input is generated within the application or via a third party application if the function is exposed.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the string that is passed to the `eval()` function. If the application is using an API where this utility function is being used, the malicious string can be injected into the payload that is passed to the utility function.

**Relation to CVE-2019-9115:**

Based on the description, the content does relate to a potential vulnerability. However, without more information about the specific `irisnet/irisnet-crypto` project and the `utils.js` file, it's hard to verify if this is exactly related to CVE-2019-9115. CVE-2019-9115 is a placeholder, so the provided content is potentially relevant.

**Summary**

The `utils.js` code uses the `eval()` function, which is a known security risk. It could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they can control the input to this function. This constitutes a major vulnerability.
