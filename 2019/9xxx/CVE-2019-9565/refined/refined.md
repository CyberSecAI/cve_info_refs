Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability detailed in the GoSecure blog post, which is related to CVE-2019-9565 :

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A software bug in the Antidote suite, specifically within its plugin handlers, causes the software to attempt to access a network file share at `\\PLUG-INS.company.int\Antidote`.
*   This occurs when the software the plugin is designed for (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, InCopy, InDesign) is not installed on the system.
*   A faulty string concatenation results in a null path being appended, which creates a path starting with a backslash (`\`), which Windows interprets as a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Faulty String Concatenation:** The core vulnerability lies in the Antidote software's incorrect handling of paths when related software is not installed, resulting in a UNC path being accessed.
2.  **Default AD Permissions:** Active Directory's default permissions allow authenticated domain users to create arbitrary DNS records, enabling attackers to register the `PLUG-INS` subdomain.
3.  **Lack of Input Validation:**  Antidote does not validate the software installation path properly, which leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **NTLM Hash Capture:** Attackers can register the `PLUG-INS` DNS record to point to their machine. Every instance of Antidote that is launched will then attempt to authenticate against the attacker's machine, leaking NTLM hashes.
*   **NTLM Relaying:** Captured NTLM hashes can be used to perform NTLM relay attacks, potentially gaining access to other services and resources on the domain under the context of the victim user.
*   **Credential Theft:** Hashes can be cracked to obtain cleartext passwords.
*   **Wide-Scale Impact:** Since Antidote is a popular software, this vulnerability can affect a large number of users within an organization.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data, emails, or even remote code execution if the victim has local administrator privileges on other machines.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **DNS Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the ability to create DNS records within the Active Directory domain to control where the UNC path resolves.
2.  **Network Traffic Interception:** The flawed path handling forces Windows to resolve the non existent server name and send an NTLM authentication attempt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Domain Membership:** The attacker needs to be a member of the domain to exploit the default permissions for creating DNS records.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to receive the authentication attempts (can be same LAN or different as long as the DNS can resolve the crafted address).
*   **Tooling:** The attacker needs tools to register the malicious DNS record (e.g., Powermad) and capture/relay NTLM authentication attempts (e.g., Responder, Hashcat, John the Ripper).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when plugin handlers are launched to check for updates, and the related software is not installed.
*   The vulnerable plugin handlers are for Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InCopy, and Adobe InDesign.
*   The vendor, Druide, was initially contacted in December 2017, but a fix was not immediately released. They later released updated versions of Antidote 8, 9, and 10.
*   Mitigation includes updating Antidote, restricting DNS record creation, and using the Global Query Block List to prevent resolution of the `PLUG-INS` record. Also removing faulty plugin handlers.
*   The vulnerability allows for passive hash collection.
