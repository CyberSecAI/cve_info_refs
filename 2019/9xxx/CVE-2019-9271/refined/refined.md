  "CVE-2019-9271": {
    "description": "The provided information relates to a patch for CVE-2019-9271, which is described as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability in the MNH driver. The root cause is a missing break-before-make (BBM) enforcement during huge IO/VMAP mappings within the ioremap_page_range function. Specifically, the function attempts to create huge mappings (using p*d_set_huge) over existing page table entries, which can lead to leaking page table memory and cause TLB conflicts and spurious aborts. The fix prevents block mappings when an existing entry is present.",
    "root_cause": "Missing break-before-make (BBM) enforcement during huge IO/VMAP mappings in ioremap_page_range.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Page table memory leak",
      "TLB conflicts",
      "Spurious aborts"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially gain elevated privileges, cause memory leaks, and trigger system instability through TLB conflicts and spurious aborts.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploiting the ioremap_page_range function by triggering huge IO/VMAP mappings over existing table entries.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path related to IO/VMAP mappings."
