Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow within the built-in web server of Moxa's MB3xxx series protocol gateways. There were two separate issues that lead to the buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** This is the core vulnerability, where the web server doesn't properly validate the size of input data, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the overflow to crash the device's web service, causing it to become unavailable.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  The overflow can potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web interface of the affected Moxa devices.
*   **Network-based:** The attacks likely target network services via HTTP requests.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory indicates that exploitation requires a low skill level.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the targeted device, meaning they need to be able to communicate with the device's web server.
*  **Unauthenticated:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability as specified by the AV:N/AC:L/PR:N values in CVSS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Moxa product lines: MB3170, MB3180, MB3270, MB3280, MB3480, and MB3660 series.
*   The fixes involve updating the firmware to a version higher than what is listed in the advisory.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is high (CVSS v3 base score of 9.8) due to the potential for arbitrary code execution and DoS.

This analysis is based on the information provided in the Moxa security advisory and the ICS-CERT advisory.
