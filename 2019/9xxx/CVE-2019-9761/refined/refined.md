The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities in the `phpshe` project, which are:

**1. Blind XXE vulnerability in `/include/plugin/payment/wechat/notify_url.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses `simplexml_load_string()` to parse XML data received from `php://input` without proper sanitization. When using a vulnerable version of libxml (< 2.9.0), external entities are resolved by default, leading to XXE.
*   **Vulnerability:** External Entity Injection (XXE).
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary file reading. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read any file on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a crafted XML payload to the vulnerable endpoint `/include/plugin/payment/wechat/notify_url.php`. The payload uses external entity definitions to read the contents of files on the server and exfiltrate them via a DNS request.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can send arbitrary HTTP requests. No authentication is needed.

**2. SQL Injection in `/include/plugin/payment/alipay/pay.php` with parameter `id`**

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses a user-controlled parameter `$order_id` to construct the table name in a SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL query execution. The attacker can use this vulnerability to extract database information.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a malicious HTTP request to `/include/plugin/payment/alipay/pay.php` with a crafted `id` parameter containing SQL injection code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can send arbitrary HTTP requests. No authentication is needed.
