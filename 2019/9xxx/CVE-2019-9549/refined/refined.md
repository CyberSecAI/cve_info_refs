The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability found in PopojiCMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF measures.
- The `/PopojiCMS/po-admin/route.php?mod=user&act=addnew` endpoint is vulnerable to CSRF.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can create a new administrator account. This gives the attacker full control over the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page, for example, by embedding the attack in a link that is sent in an email.
- When the victim visits the attacker's page, the form is automatically submitted, creating the new admin account in the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a webpage that can be accessed by a logged in admin of PopojiCMS.
- The attacker does not need access to the application, other than to view the page source to determine the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of HTML and Javascript in order to construct the malicious page and the form.
