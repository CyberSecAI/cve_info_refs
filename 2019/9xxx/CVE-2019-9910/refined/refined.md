Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The KingComposer WordPress plugin echoes the `id` parameter from the URL directly into the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.
- This allows the attacker to:
    - Bypass CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user (e.g. change user settings, create new content, etc).
    - Read data that the logged-in user has access to.
    - Potentially perform other malicious actions like redirecting the user to a malicious page, or capturing credentials/session data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `id` parameter.
- The vulnerable URL path is: `/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=kc-mapper&id=[malicious code]`.
- An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on this crafted URL or embed it in a malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click the malicious URL while logged in to the affected WordPress website with the vulnerable plugin.
- The attacker does not require any prior privileges or access to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected software: KingComposer WordPress plugin
- Affected version: 2.7.6
- Patched version: None (as of the disclosure date)
- The vulnerable code location is in `kingcomposer/includes/kc.actions.php`: `echo 'kc_post_ID = "'.$_GET['id'].'",';`
- The vendor was contacted but did not provide a fix at the time of disclosure.
- CVSS score: 6.1 Medium (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
