Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-9194 vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
*   **Affected Product:** elFinder
*   **Affected Versions:** < 2.1.48
*   **Location:** PHP connector component
*   **Root Cause:** The elFinder PHP connector component allows unauthenticated users to upload files and perform file modification operations. The file name of uploaded files is not validated, allowing shell metacharacters. When performing image operations on JPEG files, the filename is passed to the `exiftran` utility without appropriate sanitization, causing shell commands in the file name to be executed, resulting in remote command injection as the web server user.
*   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of filenames when passed to the `exiftran` utility.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An unauthenticated attacker uploads a malicious JPEG file with a crafted filename containing shell metacharacters.
    2.  The attacker triggers an image operation (e.g., resizing, rotation) that uses the `exiftran` utility.
    3.  The unsanitized filename is passed to `exiftran`, resulting in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Impact:** Remote command injection as the web server user, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Exploitability:** Exploits exist in exploit-db (46481, 46539) and metasploit.
*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   The elFinder PHP connector must be enabled.
    *   The system must have `exiftran` installed and in the `$PATH`.
*   **Reported by:** Thomas Chauchefoin (Synacktiv)

The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
