##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### It's all in the details

![Symfony ](/files/symfony-black-03.png)
#### Symfony 5 extensions

There’s no limit to the functionality you can incorporate in your Bolt project. At its core, Bolt is a Symfony application, so you can use the tools provided by the framework.

![Twig](/files/branch.svg)
#### Twig templates

There's a reason why Twig is the de-facto standard across the PHP community. It is flexible, fast and secure. Take a look how easy it is to generate the HTML for your pages.

![Built-in internationalisation ](/files/translating.svg)
#### Built-in internationalisation

Need more languages? No problem, it's just one line of code. The even cooler thing? With field-level control you can decide *exactly* which parts of the page will be translated.

![API](/files/jack-in-the-box.svg)
#### Out-of-the-box API

Bolt provides a RESTful and GraphQL API. No extra configuration needed. Use the CMS in headless mode, alongside a static site generator, or simply to feed data into whatever other platform.

![Dummy content](/files/dummy.svg)
#### Dummy content

Dummy content. You need it to test, or to showcase your work to your clients. Putting it in there is tiresome, though. Good news: not anymore. All you need to do is use one single line of code.

![Content editors](/files/content.svg)
#### Best rich content editors

You get the best content editors: Article and Redactor. Fully licensed for use in Bolt itself. For free. With love. Because we believe creating and adapting content should be easy. Period.

I spent a few hours yesterday and today building a new hobby site with [@BoltCMS](https://twitter.com/BoltCMS) and wow, the new version is FANTASTIC. It's so easy to get a site up and running. I'm really loving this.

![](https://boltcms.io/files/homepage/abjorkland.jpeg)

In the past I've looked at differenct CMS:s and tried my hands at WordPress. But being such a fan of [#Symfony](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Symfony?src=hashtag_click) I fell into the embrace of [@BoltCMS](https://twitter.com/BoltCMS) this week.

It's a CMS and a Symfony application! 💜

This week I've tried out multi-lang and extensions and am enamoured.
