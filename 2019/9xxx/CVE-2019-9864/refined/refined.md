CVE-2019-9864:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Parameter tampering vulnerability in PHP Scripts Mall Amazon Affiliate Store 2.1.6. Certain parameters in the URL or web page form field data entered by a user are changed without that user's authorization.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unvalidated input leading to manipulation of the payment amount.
  - Impact of exploitation: Attacker can modify the payment amount to an arbitrary value (e.g., 1) before submitting the payment through PayPal, leading to financial loss for the store owner.
  - Attack vectors: By intercepting the data sent to PayPal using a tool like Burp Suite, an attacker can modify the "amount" parameter.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to register and log in to the Amazon Affiliate Store site.
    - The attacker needs to add a product to the cart and proceed to checkout.
    - The attacker needs to enable a proxy tool (like Burp Suite) to intercept the payment data.
    - The attacker needs to find the "amount" value in the intercepted data and modify it.
