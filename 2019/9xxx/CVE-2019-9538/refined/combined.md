### Overview

Telos Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) contains multiple XSS vulnerabilities and a database information disclosure vulnerability.

### Description

| [Telos AMHS](https://www.telos.com/enterprise/organizational-messaging/) is a web-based messaging system that supports DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) security marking requirements. AMHS versions prior to version 4.1.5.5 contain multiple XSS vulnerabilities and also fail to properly restrict access to information about other users on the system. |

### Impact

| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  These issues are addressed in AMHS version 4.1.5.5. Please [contact Telos](https://www.telos.com/enterprise/organizational-messaging/support/) for update availability. |
