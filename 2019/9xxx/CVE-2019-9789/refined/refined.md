Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9789:

**CVE Description:**
The CVE-2019-9789 description on the provided page states "Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 66". It further specifies that "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 65" and that "some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code". It then provides a link to a buglist of the resolved issues.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is multiple memory safety issues present in Firefox 65 which are fixed in Firefox 66, including:
*   Use-after-free
*   Heap-use-after-free
*   Off-by-one reads past the end of a buffer
*   Stack buffer overflow
*   Assertion failures
*   Uninitialized pointer use

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The identified weaknesses include:
*   Use-after-free in `mozilla::net::nsHttpTransaction::ReadSegments`, `mozilla::a11y::DocAccessibleChildBase::ActorDestroy`, `mozilla::BackgroundHangAnnotators::GatherAnnotations()`.
*   Assertion failure in JavaScript and WebAssembly components.
*   Stack buffer overflow in `IncomingRtpPacket`.
*   Off-by-one reads in `UTF8CharEnumerator`.
*   Probable free of uninitialized pointer in `ProxyAccessible::RelationByType()`.
*   Heap-use-after-free related to `AddressSanitizer`.
*   Crash in `SkBitmapCache::PrivateDeleteRec`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
*   Arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.
*   Denial of service due to crashes.
*   Unexpected behavior or incorrect program states.

**Attack Vectors:**
The specific attack vectors would depend on the specific vulnerability:
*   Web pages crafted to trigger the identified memory safety issues.
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities via Javascript/WebAssembly components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to:
*   Be able to deliver malicious content to the victim's browser or trigger the conditions that lead to the vulnerabilities to be exploited
*   Have knowledge of how to trigger these specific vulnerabilities.
*   Potentially have in-depth knowledge of the affected code segments to trigger arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This CVE aggregates multiple memory safety bugs that were fixed in Firefox 66.
*   The issues were reported by both Mozilla developers and the community.
*  The bugs are related to multiple components of the browser including networking, javascript, accessibility, graphics, and internationalization, indicating a broad range of potential attack surfaces.
