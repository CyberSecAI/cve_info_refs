Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9021:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read within the PHAR reading functions of PHP. Specifically, the `phar_detect_phar_fname_ext` function in `ext/phar/phar.c` is the root cause. It stems from how PHP parses filenames when handling PHAR archives.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read**: When parsing the filename of a PHAR archive, PHP might attempt to read memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read allocated and unallocated memory.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The vulnerability may cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted PHAR archives**: An attacker can create a specially crafted PHAR archive with a filename designed to trigger the buffer over-read.
*   **Network Attack**: This can be delivered by a remote attacker as described in the NetApp advisory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide malicious PHAR files**: The attacker needs a way to deliver a specially crafted PHAR file to the vulnerable PHP application. This could be through a file upload mechanism, a network service or other means. The attacker doesn't necessarily need local access as the NetApp Advisory indicates a network attack vector.
*   **Execution by vulnerable PHP code**: The attacker needs to trigger the parsing of this crafted archive by the vulnerable PHP code.

**Additional Notes**:

*   This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2018-20783, although both affect PHAR reading functions, and are both included in the same openSUSE security update.
*   The SUSE Bugzilla entry ([1126713](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1126713)) confirms the vulnerability is fixed.
*   The provided information indicates the vulnerability affects multiple PHP versions prior to the following fixes: 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1
