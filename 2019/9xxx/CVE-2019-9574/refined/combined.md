Ce plugin est une base fantastique, dommage qu‚Äôil ne soit pas termin√©, et comporte de nombreux petits bugs et faute de frappe dans le code.
Je ne peux qu‚Äôencourager ses auteurs √† le reprendre car c‚Äôest vraiment un super outil.

Almost works. However, the styling is all over the place, so to actually put this in front of a client to use I wouldn‚Äôt be able to, without fixing all the backend styling issues in the plugin directly.
Also, when you want to update a user, there is a JavaScript error which stops you from doing this. Also the select fields are confusing and counter-intuitive to use.
A shame as this very nearly does what it should. Sadly it‚Äôs not really ready for production websites as it‚Äôs full of annoyances and bugs.
Still. For a work in progress prototype, it‚Äôs relatively good. If you could update employees, which you can‚Äôt at the moment.
Also. Employees randomly disappear.
What a frustrating plugin.

### [Not able to dismiss sales banner](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-able-to-dismiss-sales-banner/)

As long as your plugin has been around, you should know that the practice is encouraged of allowing users of your plugin to dismiss your sales banner.
Keeping strategic sections of the plugin un-usable until someone clicks and goes to your sales page seems to have become an acceptable practice here on WordPress.org.
However, people like me will not do business with you because of your aggressive approach of keeping your sales pitch on pages outside your plugin pages as well as not allowing us to remove your nags.
I do not recommend installing and going through the many pages trying to set up the plugin due to strategic limitations and sales nags that cannot be removed.

Subject: CVE-2019-9573 / CVE-2019-9574: WordPress plugin hrm missing server
 side authorization checks

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I found several vulnerabilities from WordPress plugin hrm (WP Human Resource
Management) where server side authorization checks are missing. Plugin URL
<https://wordpress.org/plugins/hrm/>. Affected 2.2.5 and possibly below. Fixed in
2.2.6 according to developer who didn't respond to me, but communicated with
WordPress.

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9574>

When creating new leave as admin user there is user picker visible in the UI.
Using same queries as picker functionality any logged in user (e.g.
Subscriber) can use search_emp_leave_records action to print all WordPress
users credentials from database.

{"success":true,"data":[{"ID":"1","user_login":"henri","user_pass":"$P$Bho3..

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9573>

Any user can create new leave and can change status of leave (approving,
canceling etc).

Recommendation for developers:

Authorize users using a whitelist of roles allowed to call specific actions.
Define roles for all actions with secure default e.g. admin only. Ensure that
password hashes are not printed to any user. Function
<https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_users> could be used to list
the users.

Timeline:

2019-01-22: Report to developer and WordPress plugins team
2019-02-23: Fix released
2019-03-05: CVEs assigned by MITRE
