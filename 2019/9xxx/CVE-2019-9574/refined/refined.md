Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-9574:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is missing server-side authorization checks within the WP Human Resource Management plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `search_emp_leave_records` action lacks proper access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The plugin allows any logged-in user, including low-privileged users like "Subscriber," to access sensitive data through the `search_emp_leave_records` action.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the lack of authorization, any logged-in user can retrieve all WordPress user credentials, including password hashes, via the `search_emp_leave_records` action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credential Exposure:** Attackers could gain access to password hashes of all users on the WordPress site.
*   **Account Takeover:**  With the exposed credentials, attackers could potentially gain full control of the WordPress site by using the admin credentials or other high-privileged user accounts.
*   **Data Breach:** This vulnerability could lead to a full compromise of the HR management data and other potentially sensitive user information handled by the plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered by interacting with the plugin's web interface via a crafted request, specifically by calling the `search_emp_leave_records` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site, even with minimal privileges like a subscriber role, to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in version 2.2.5 and possibly earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.6.
*   The original report was sent to the plugin developer and the WordPress plugins team.
*   The report also mentions the recommendation for developers to:
    *   Authorize users using a whitelist of roles allowed to call specific actions.
    *   Define roles for all actions with secure defaults (e.g., admin only).
    *   Ensure that password hashes are not printed to any user.
    *   Use `get_users` function to list users.

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-9574 highlights a critical authorization flaw within the WP Human Resource Management plugin, allowing any logged-in user to extract all WordPress user credentials, including password hashes, leading to potential account takeovers and data breaches. The vulnerability stems from a lack of server-side authorization checks on the `search_emp_leave_records` action, which is accessible to all authenticated users.
