Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `inotify_update_existing_watch()` function within the Linux kernel's inotify subsystem.
- Specifically, when the `IN_MASK_CREATE` flag is used with `inotify_add_watch()`, the function fails to call `fsnotify_put_mark()` after `fsnotify_find_mark()` if a watch already exists. This omission leads to a reference count leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The core issue is a memory leak in the `fsnotify_mark` structure. The `fsnotify_find_mark` increases the reference count of a mark and the code is missing a corresponding put call via `fsnotify_put_mark`.
- **Reference Counting Error:** The code improperly manages the reference counter for the `fsnotify_mark`, which results in the structure not being deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can trigger this memory leak by creating multiple inotify watches, ultimately leading to memory exhaustion and causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to create inotify watches.
- **Inotify API:** The vulnerability is exploited by using the inotify API to add file system watches with the `IN_MASK_CREATE` flag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be a user with the ability to call the inotify API to add watches, specifically needing the `IN_MASK_CREATE` flag to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The provided patch from git.kernel.org (commit `62c9d2674b31d4c8a674bee86b7edc6da2803aea`) shows the fix, which adds a call to `fsnotify_put_mark()` to correct the memory leak.
- The Fedora mailing list entries show that the fix has been included in kernel updates for Fedora 28 and 29.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the CVE and its impact, as well as the fix being included in the updates.
- The NetApp advisory indicates that their products are affected if they incorporate the vulnerable Linux kernel versions.
