Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-9510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Windows handles automatic reconnections of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions, specifically with changes introduced in Windows 10 1803 and Windows Server 2019. When an RDP session is locked and then experiences a temporary network disconnect, the automatic reconnection feature restores the session to an unlocked state, bypassing the lock screen. This happens because the client caches the credentials, and reuses them upon automatic reconnect, without prompting the user to re-authenticate, which hinders credential providers from prompting when a machine is unlocked in this context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is the bypass of the Windows lock screen when an RDP session reconnects automatically.
*   **Cached Credentials:** The vulnerability exploits the behavior of cached credentials being reused during automatic reconnection without prompting for re-authentication.
*   **Inadequate Session State Management:**  The RDP reconnection mechanism fails to properly recognize and maintain the locked state of a session after a disconnect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to a user's RDP session without needing their credentials, provided they can cause a network interruption to trigger an automatic reconnection.
*   **Bypassed MFA:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions that are integrated with the Windows login screen are bypassed because the lock screen is skipped during automatic reconnection. This affects systems like Duo, Okta, and potentially others.
*  **Bypassed Login banners**: Any login banners enforced by an organization will also be bypassed.
*   **Compromised Security:** This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized actions on the remote system, and other forms of compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Disconnection:** The primary attack vector involves interrupting the network connection of an RDP client, causing a disconnect and triggering the automatic reconnection.
*   **Physical access to the RDP client system**: If the attacker has access to the RDP client system, an interruption of network connectivity will trigger the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to RDP Client System:**  The attacker needs physical or logical access to a system that is being used as an RDP client.
*   **Ability to Disrupt Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to interrupt the network connectivity of the RDP client, even if temporarily, to trigger the automatic reconnection mechanism.
* No user interaction is needed on the remote end.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present regardless of whether Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enabled.
*   The vulnerability exists in Windows 10 1803, Windows Server 2019, and newer versions. Some older RDP client/server combinations can show similar symptoms but might not bypass MFA/login banners.
*  The auto-reconnect cookie is updated hourly.
* The vendor, Microsoft, considers this behavior to be working as intended and not a security vulnerability.
