- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper error handling within the CODESYS communication server when processing specific requests. This leads to a crash when a crafted request is received.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the affected CODESYS product unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted request to the CODESYS communication server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with low skills can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs network access to the affected CODESYS product. No authentication is required.
