{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in webargs due to the use of a shared cache for processed request data. When multiple requests are processed in parallel, they can interfere with each other's cached data, leading to incorrect parsing results.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition, incorrect data handling.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Incorrect data parsing, leading to unexpected behavior or data corruption.",
  "Attack vectors": "Multiple concurrent requests to an endpoint using webargs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to send concurrent requests to the affected server."
