Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9187:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `aggregate` plugin in Ikiwiki not using the `LWPx::ParanoidAgent` module consistently. While other plugins like `blogspam`, `openid`, and `pinger` used this module if available, `aggregate` did not. This allowed the `aggregate` plugin to fetch arbitrary URLs without proper filtering or security checks. Additionally, if `LWPx::ParanoidAgent` was not installed, the mentioned plugins would fall back to using the standard LWP library which is also susceptible to the same vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The `aggregate` plugin could be tricked into making requests to arbitrary URLs, including:
    *   Local files via `file:` URIs, leading to local file disclosure.
    *   Other URI schemes (e.g., `gopher:`) that could be misused.
    *   Hosts resolving to loopback (127.x.x.x) or RFC 1918 (192.168.x.x, etc.) IP addresses.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The plugin could be made to request slow "tarpit" URLs, causing delays and potentially disrupting service.
*   **Unsafe GET Requests:** Could trigger undesired side-effects on local web servers by issuing GET requests to internal services that might not be expecting external requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could access sensitive local files on the server by using `file:` URIs.
*   **Denial of Service:** By requesting slow-responding URLs, an attacker can cause the Ikiwiki instance to become unresponsive.
*   **Undesired Side Effects:** Attackers could interact with internal network services via their GET request endpoints, leading to potentially unsafe actions, depending on how the internal service interprets the incoming request.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker, with the ability to edit the wiki content and use the vulnerable plugins, could exploit this vulnerability by:

*   Manipulating URLs used by the `aggregate`, `openid`, or `pinger` plugins to point to malicious resources (local files, internal services, tarpits).
*   Exploiting the `openid` plugin, which can request URLs controlled by unauthenticated users, and the `pinger` plugin that can request URLs controlled by authorized wiki editors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authorized wiki editor access:** For exploiting `aggregate` and `pinger`, the attacker needs to be able to edit wiki content and influence the plugins' behavior.
*   **Unauthenticated user control (for openid):**  For exploiting `openid`, the attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by:
*   Restricting the allowed URI schemes to `http:` and `https:`, preventing access to `file:`, `gopher:`, and other schemes.
*   Ensuring that a configured proxy is used for all outgoing requests. The proxy is then responsible for blocking undesired addresses (loopback, RFC 1918).
*   Using `LWPx::ParanoidAgent` (if available and no proxy configured) to prevent requests to loopback and RFC 1918 addresses and to implement timeout behavior for DoS mitigation.
*   Recommending that users install `LWPx::ParanoidAgent`.

The fix was implemented in ikiwiki version 3.20190228 and backported to 3.20170111.1 for Debian 9 and 3.20141016.4+deb8u1 for Debian 8.
