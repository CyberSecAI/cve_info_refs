ikiwiki 3.20190228 released with [these changes](#news-version-3.20190228.default)

* aggregate: Use LWPx::ParanoidAgent if available.
  Previously blogspam, openid and pinger used this module if available,
  but aggregate did not. This prevents server-side request forgery or
  local file disclosure, and mitigates denial of service when slow
  "tarpit" URLs are accessed.
  ([CVE-2019-9187](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-9187))
* blogspam, openid, pinger: Use a HTTP proxy if configured, even if
  LWPx::ParanoidAgent is installed.
  Previously, only aggregate would obey proxy configuration. If a proxy
  is used, the proxy (not ikiwiki) is responsible for preventing attacks
  like CVE-2019-9187.
* aggregate, blogspam, openid, pinger: Do not access non-http, non-https
  URLs.
  Previously, these plugins would have allowed non-HTTP-based requests if
  LWPx::ParanoidAgent was not installed. Preventing file URIs avoids local
  file disclosure, and preventing other rarely-used URI schemes like
  gopher mitigates request forgery attacks.
* aggregate, openid, pinger: Document LWPx::ParanoidAgent as strongly
  recommended.
  These plugins can request attacker-controlled URLs in some site
  configurations.
* blogspam: Document LWPx::ParanoidAgent as desirable.
  This plugin doesn't request attacker-controlled URLs, so it's
  non-critical here.
* blogspam, openid, pinger: Consistently use cookiejar if configured.
  Previously, these plugins would only obey this configuration if
  LWPx::ParanoidAgent was not installed, but this appears to have been
  unintended.
* po: Always filter .po files.
  The po plugin in previous ikiwiki releases made the second and
  subsequent filter call per (page, destpage) pair into a no-op,
  apparently in an attempt to prevent *recursive* filtering (which as
  far as we can tell can't happen anyway), with the undesired effect
  of interpreting the raw .po file as page content (e.g. Markdown)
  if it was inlined into the same page twice, which is apparently
  something that tails.org does. Simplify this by deleting the code
  that prevented repeated filtering. Thanks, intrigeri
  (Closes: #[911356](http://bugs.debian.org/911356))

ikiwiki 3.20170111.1 was also released, backporting the LWP-related
changes from 3.20190228 to the branch used in Debian 9 'stretch'.

Hash: SHA256

Package        : ikiwiki
Version        : 3.20141016.4+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-9187

The ikiwiki maintainers discovered that the aggregate plugin did not use
LWPx::ParanoidAgent. On sites where the aggregate plugin is enabled, authorized
wiki editors could tell ikiwiki to fetch potentially undesired URIs even if
LWPx::ParanoidAgent was installed:

    local files via file: URIs
    other URI schemes that might be misused by attackers, such as gopher:
    hosts that resolve to loopback IP addresses (127.x.x.x)
    hosts that resolve to RFC 1918 IP addresses (192.168.x.x etc.)

This could be used by an attacker to publish information that should not have
been accessible, cause denial of service by requesting "tarpit" URIs that are
slow to respond, or cause undesired side-effects if local web servers implement
"unsafe" GET requests. (CVE-2019-9187)

Additionally, if liblwpx-paranoidagent-perl is not installed, the
blogspam, openid and pinger plugins would fall back to LWP, which is
susceptible to similar attacks. This is unlikely to be a practical problem for
the blogspam plugin because the URL it requests is under the control of the
wiki administrator, but the openid plugin can request URLs controlled by
unauthenticated remote users, and the pinger plugin can request URLs controlled
by authorized wiki editors.

This is addressed in ikiwiki 3.20190228 as follows, with the same fixes
backported to Debian 9 in version 3.20170111.1:

* URI schemes other than http: and https: are not accepted, preventing access
  to file:, gopher:, etc.

* If a proxy is configured in the ikiwiki setup file, it is used for all
  outgoing http: and https: requests. In this case the proxy is responsible for
  blocking any requests that are undesired, including loopback or RFC 1918
  addresses.

* If a proxy is not configured, and liblwpx-paranoidagent-perl is installed, it
  will be used. This prevents loopback and RFC 1918 IP addresses, and sets a
  timeout to avoid denial of service via "tarpit" URIs.

* Otherwise, the ordinary LWP user-agent will be used. This allows requests to
  loopback and RFC 1918 IP addresses, and has less robust timeout behaviour.
  We are not treating this as a vulnerability: if this behaviour is not
  acceptable for your site, please make sure to install LWPx::ParanoidAgent or
  disable the affected plugins.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
3.20141016.4+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ikiwiki packages. In addition it is also
recommended that you have liblwpx-paranoidagent-perl installed, which listed in
the recommends field of ikiwiki.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

[ikiwiki-hosting](./ikiwiki-hosting/)

ikiwiki-hosting is an interface on top of Ikiwiki to allow easy management
of lots of ikiwiki sites. I developed it for
[Branchable](http://www.branchable.com/), an Ikiwiki hosting provider.
It has a powerful, scriptable command-line interface, and also
includes special-purpose ikiwiki plugins for things like a user control
panel.

To get a feel for it, here are some examples:

```
ikisite create foo.ikiwiki.net --admin http://joey.kitenet.net/
ikisite branch foo.ikiwiki.net bar.ikiwiki.net
ikisite backup bar.ikiwiki.net --stdout | ssh otherhost 'ikisite restore bar.ikiwiki.net --stdin'

```

ikiwiki-hosting is free software, released under the AGPL. Its website:

[ikiwiki version 3.0](./ikiwiki_version_3.0/)

Ikiwiki has reached version 3.0 and entered a new phase in its
[development cycle](../roadmap/).

The 3.0 release of ikiwiki changes several defaults and finishes
some transitions. You will need to modify your wikis to work with
ikiwiki 3.0. A document explaining the process is available
in [upgrade to 3.0](../tips/upgrade_to_3.0/).

The highlights of the changes in version 3.0 include:

* Support for uploading [attachments](../plugins/attachment/).
* Can [rename](../plugins/rename/) and [remove](../plugins/remove/) pages and files via the web.
* [Web based setup](../plugins/websetup/).
* Blog-style [comments](../plugins/comments/) as an alternative to Discussion pages.
* Many other new plugins including [htmlbalance](../plugins/htmlbalance/), [format](../plugins/format/),
  [progress](../plugins/progress/), [color](../plugins/color/), [autoindex](../plugins/autoindex/),
  [cutpaste](../plugins/cutpaste/), [hnb](../plugins/hnb/), [creole](../plugins/creole/), [txt](../plugins/txt/),
  [amazon s3](../plugins/amazon_s3/), [pinger](../plugins/pinger/), [pingee](../plugins/pingee/),
  [edittemplate](../plugins/edittemplate/)
* The RecentChanges page is compiled statically, not generated from the CGI.
* Support for additional revision control systems: [bzr](../rcs/bzr/),
  [monotone](../rcs/monotone/)
* Support for [untrusted git push](../tips/untrusted_git_push/).
* A new version (3.00) of the plugin API, exporting additional
  commonly used functions from `IkiWiki.pm`.
* Nearly everything in ikiwiki is now a plugin, from WikiLinks to
  page editing, to RecentChanges.
* Far too many bug fixes, features, and enhancements to list here.

Thanks to the many contributors to ikiwiki 3.0, including:

Jelmer Vernooij, Recai OktaÃ…ÂŸ, William Uther, Simon McVittie, Axel Beckert,
Bernd Zeimetz, Gabriel McManus, PaweÃ…Â‚ TÃ„Â™cza, Peter Simons, Manoj

Enrico Zini, intrigeri, Scott Bronson, Brian May, Adeodato SimÃƒÂ³, Brian
Downing, Nis Martensen. (And anyone I missed.)

Also, thanks to the users, bug submitters, and documentation wiki editors.
Without you, ikiwiki would just be a little thing I use for my home page.

I've produced a [code\_swarm](http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~ogawa/codeswarm/)
visualization of the first 2+ years of ikiwiki's commit history.

--[Joey](../users/joey/)

### notes

Interesting things to watch for:

* Initial development of ikiwiki to the point it was getting web edits.
  (First 2 seconds of video!)
* Introduction to plugin support, and later, plugin changes dominating code
  changes.
* Introduction of openid support and the resulting *swarm* of openid
  commenters.
* Switch to git, my name in the logs changes from "joey" to "Joey Hess",
  and there are more code commits directly from others.

Getting the commit log was tricky because every web commit is in there too,
so it has to deal with things like IPs and openids. The [code swarm log.pl](./code_swarm/code_swarm_log.pl/)
script will munge the log to handle these, and it was configured with
[code swarm.config](./code_swarm/code_swarm.config).

Video editing by kino, ffmpeg, ffmpeg2theora, and too many hours of pain.

[server move](./server_move/)

I've gone ahead and moved ikiwiki.info to the faster box mentioned on
[server speed](./server_speed/). Most poll respondants felt the old box was fast enough,
but it's getting a bit overloaded with other stuff.

If you can see this, you're seeing the new server. If not, your DNS server
hasn't caught up yet. I'll keep the old server up for a while too and merge
any changes across since git makes that bog-easy.

Please report any problems..

[no more email notifications](./no_more_email_notifications/)

ikiwiki.info has upgraded to the not yet released ikiwiki 2.30. This
version of ikiwiki drops support for subscribing to commit mail
notifications for pages. The idea is that you can subscribe to the new
[RecentChanges](../recentchanges/) feed instead. (Or create your own custom feed of only the
changes you're interested in, and subscribe to that.)

So if you were subscribed to mail notifications on here, you'll need to
change how you keep track of changes. Please let me know if there are any
missing features in the [RecentChanges](../recentchanges/) feeds.

Statically building the RecentChanges also has performance implications,
I'll keep an eye on [server speed](./server_speed/)..

[ikiwiki version 2.0](./ikiwiki_version_2.0/)

Ikiwiki has reached version 2.0 and entered a new phase in its
[development cycle](../roadmap/).

With the 2.0 release of ikiwiki, some major changes have been made to the
default configuration:

* The `usedirs` setting is enabled by default. This *will* break all URLs
  to wikis that did not have `usedirs` turned on before, unless you follow
  the procedure described at [switching to usedirs](../tips/switching_to_usedirs/)
  or edit your setup file to turn `usedirs` off: `usedirs => 0,`
* [OpenID](../plugins/openid/) logins are now enabled by default, if the
  [Net::OpenID::Consumer](http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=dist&query=Net%3A%3AOpenID%3A%3AConsumer) perl module is available. Password logins
  are also still enabled by default. If you like, you can turn either OpenID
  or password logins off via the `disable_plugins` setting.

An overview of changes in the year since the 1.0 release:

[Article on Ikiwiki as a BTS](./Article_on_Ikiwiki_as_a_BTS/)

[Integrated issue tracking with Ikiwiki](http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2007/040607-integrated-issue-tracking-ikiwiki.html) by Joey Hess is now available on LinuxWorld.com. (LinuxWorld's author contract also allows this article to become part of the project's documentation.) Learn how to use Ikiwiki inlining and PageSpecs for lightweight workflow. Joey also explains how having the BTS and docs in the project's revision control system can help users of distributed revision control systems keep bug tracking info in sync with code changes.

If you have specifics on performance issues, you might mention them on the
[discussion](./server_speed/discussion/) page.

Ikiwiki is now hosted at [Branchable](http://branchable.com/).

[irc channel](./irc_channel/)

Ikiwiki now has an IRC channel: `#ikiwiki` on irc.oftc.net

The channel features live commit messages for CIA for changes to both
ikiwiki's code and this wiki. Plus occasional talk about ikiwiki.

Thanks to [JoshTriplett](../users/joshtriplett/) for making this happen.

[donations](./donations/)

After looking up and noticing that another 8 hours had passed, replying to people and hacking, I've added a [TipJar](../tipjar/) page, in case anyone feels like tossing me a few bucks for ikiwiki. TIA! --[Joey](../users/joey/)

[openid](./openid/)

Ikiwiki in svn now has support for using [OpenID](http://openid.net), a
decentralized authentication mechanism that allows you to have one login
that you can use on a growing number of websites.

Traditional password-based logins are still supported, but I'm considering
switching at least ikiwiki.info over to using only OpenID logins.
That would mean blowing away all the currently registered users and
their preferences. If you're active on this wiki, I suggest you log out and
log back in, try out the OpenID signup process if you don't already have an
OpenID, and see how OpenID works for you. And let me know your feelings about
making such a switch. --[Joey](../users/joey/)

Accept only OpenID for logins (51%)

---

Accept only password logins (14%)

Accept both (33%)

[stylesheets](./stylesheets/)

Some people may consider ikiwiki's default look to be a bit plain. Someone
on slashdot even suggested perhaps it uses html 1.0. (Yes, an ikiwiki site
has survived its first slashdotting. With static html, that's not very
hard..) While the default style is indeed plain, there's more fine-tuning
going on than you might think, and it's actually all done with xhtml and
style sheets.

Stefano Zacchiroli came up with the idea of adding a [css market](../css_market/) page
where [IkiWikiUsers](../ikiwikiusers/) can share style sheets that you've come up with for
ikiwiki. This is a great idea and I encourage those of you who have
customised stylesheets to post them.

I'm also always looking for minimalistic yet refined additions to the default
style sheet, and always appreciate suggestions for it.
