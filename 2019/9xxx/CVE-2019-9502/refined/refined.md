  "summary": "The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Broadcom WiFi drivers, including CVE-2019-9502. This CVE involves a heap buffer overflow in the wlc_wpa_plumb_gtk function of the Broadcom wl driver when processing EAPOL messages, specifically during the 4-way handshake from an Access Point (AP). The overflow occurs when a vendor information element with a data length larger than 164 bytes is supplied.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2019-9502",
      "root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on the length of a vendor information element within an EAPOL message.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper bounds checking",
        "Heap buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A heap buffer overflow can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially remote code execution (RCE) on the vulnerable device. The impact is dependent on whether the affected device uses a SoftMAC or FullMAC chip. SoftMAC devices execute the vulnerable code in the kernel, potentially allowing for RCE in the kernel. FullMAC devices execute this code on the chipset, so the impact may be limited to the chipset.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious or compromised Access Point can send a crafted EAPOL message containing a vendor information element with an oversized length field.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must control the access point to send the malicious EAPOL frame. They do not require any prior authentication beyond being within wireless range and being able to participate in a WPA2 handshake.",
       "details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `wlc_wpa_plumb_gtk` function. This function allocates a fixed-size buffer of 164 bytes on the heap and then copies data from an IE into this buffer using memcpy. The size argument of memcpy is directly derived from the length field of the IE, without any validation, resulting in a heap overflow if this field is larger than 164. This vulnerability is present in the Broadcom `wl` driver."
