This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

# UXSS -> privesc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)

RCE in the Firefox renderer can be turned into UXSS via renderer patches (see

my Pwn2Own exploit).

Now login in to sync via UXSS on

<https://accounts.firefox.com/signin?service=sync&context=fx_desktop_v3&entrypoint=menupanel>

(this can probably be achieved via XPCOM but this is the easiest way to

do it). This lets you sync the victim browser with an attacker-controlled

account, leading immediately to:

1. Privesc to web extension
2. Arbitrary preference write by setting services.sync.prefs.sync.<pref> = true
   * On Linux: security.sandbox.content.level = 0 -> Boom, no sandbox!

     (on Windows + macOS we are capped at 1, but we can at least bypass the

     desktop & job lockdown)
   * browser.tabs.remote.autostart -> turning this off disables e10s, but only after a restart
   * browser.download.{dir,useDownloadDir} -> probably arbitrary file write, have not tested this
   * network.proxy.autoconfig\_url = <path to PAC file>, network.proxy.type = 2,

     This script will be evaluated in browser process, so we can chain with a

     Spidermonkey exploit (such as the one I used at Pwn2Own)

I'm sure there is other interesting settings which lead to a full sandbox escape.

> Arbitrary preference write by setting services.sync.prefs.sync.<pref> = true

Noting this because it wasn't obvious to me from reading the STR: when Firefox syncs prefs, it also syncs the list of prefs to sync, which is why this can be used to write to arbitrary prefs.

Ugh. I've been trying to think of any short-term mitigations we could apply here, but haven't come up with much of anything; this is basically the different parts of Sync all working as designed.

For the "install a web extension via sync" case, the addons sync engine already has some basic checks to protect against installing things from disreputable sources, see e.g.:

<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b2f1edb41241d3da6ded54edf38cca1d2d08325b/services/sync/modules/engines/addons.js#619>

They wouldn't protect against installing a webextension that's available properly from AMO though. And from a glance at the code, these checks may only be applied when writing data *to* sync, not when pulling down data *from* sync, so I don't know if they would help in this case where the sync server has been filled with malicious data.

We probably have a followup here to ensure those checks apply on read instead of on write, but it's not obvious there would be any more checks we could do to prevent syncing down "bad" webextensions.

For the "arbitrary preference write via sync" case, I guess we could try to allowlist/blocklist certain classes of pref, but I'd expect a long tail of either discovering new prefs that aren't safe (if we try to blocklist) or getting bugs from users whose custom workflow we broke (if we try to allowlist). :pauljt filed [Bug 1538015](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector") to dig through this in more detail.

The underlying problem here is that <https://accounts.firefox.com> has the special ability to silently sign the browser in to sync, by sending a WebChannel message of type "login". We should find a way to stop doing that, and I filed [Bug 1538024](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538024 "NEW") to investigate.

I don't know enough about the internals of the browser to know whether there are things we could do prevent that from happening in "suspicious" cases without breaking the various sync onboarding flows that rely on it. For example, I wonder if we have enough information when dispatching the WebChannel message here:

<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b2f1edb41241d3da6ded54edf38cca1d2d08325b/toolkit/modules/WebChannel.jsm#66>

To detect that it's coming from an iframe or other unexpected source, rather than from a top-level tab opened to accounts.firefox.com. I also don't know whether that would have helped in this case.

:pauljt talked through this with me a bit, and it doesn't sound like there's much we could do here; if the child process is sufficiently compromised then it can make itself indistinguishable from a "good" login page.

I think the right path forward on the FxA front is [Bug 1538024](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538024 "NEW"), removing the ability for web content to sign the browser in to sync.

We used to allow certain trusted origins to iframe accounts.firefox.com (via some awful code to generate X-Frame-Options and friends on-the-fly) but I believe all those integrations have been removed.

Note that I expect X-FRAME-OPTIONS/CSP will not be relevant here. In a compromised child process, the attacker can subvert any security checks internal to that process, which I believe these are. (correct me if Im wrong, but I think they hang off the document object in the child process?).

> Right, it's not iframing specific -- I just meant there's always two pieces: 1) loading the origin in it's own process, 2) *not* loading it in any other process :-)

Actually I think there might be THREE things here (*cue spanish inquistion intro*) :

1. loading the origin in it's own process
2. Not loading the the origin in another process
3. Not loading ANY other web content in the Firefox accounts process

Because we have to make sure not to load untrusted content into our trusted process.

And then FOUR (*amongst our diverse weaponary...*), make sure that either our IPC model ensures that FxA privileges are ONLY granted to this blessed process. That is either done by:

* ensuring that the parent process will only listen for FxA web channel message FROM our blessed process
* adding a check in the FxA which checks the message.target to ensure it corresponds to the correct process (im not sure if this is possible though with current messaging architecture, maybe it depends on Fission pieces).

My understanding is that these privileges are provided by [FxAccountsWebChannel.jsm](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/services/fxaccounts/FxAccountsWebChannel.jsm) ( and the mobile version [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/modules/FxAccountsWebChannel.jsm)). Assuming we force isolation of accounts.firefox.com in a seperate process, we need to ensure that the parent process will only act upon FxA messages from this process.

WebChannel architecture may provides this already though? I'm not sure if the approprate listeners are only created for a process that is loading accounts.firefox.com, or if this listener is setup for every process. IE can any content process just synthesize a login message, and not worry about loading accounts.firefox.com at all?.

And finally FIVE (*...I'll come in again...*): what about things like cookies/localStorage/Indexeddb etc. Even if a process can't load accounts.firefox.com, do we actually prevent it from setting origin specific data? (I dont think we do, yet, as this is a Fission thing IIRC) From a quick check, it looks like FxA stores a bunch of data in LocalStorage, but changing it doesn't seem to affect state. So maybe this one is not a requirement, but this is an attack to consider.

> what about things like cookies/localStorage/Indexeddb

FxA uses localStorage to manage state for signins on the web, but offhand I can't think of a way to use read/write of localStorage for accounts.firefox.com to affect the signed-in state of the browser. I won't 100% rule it out though, there are a lot of different paths through the FxA signin flow.

BTW in [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)"), I'm focusing solve on the "isolate accounts.firefox.com" solution. Taking a step back, I think there are two high level solutions here:

* isolate accounts.firefox.com so that compromised child process
* change the security model of Sync, so that accounts.firefox.com can't change the logged in sync user. Ryan's written more along those lines in 1538024)

We might want to consider aligning the solution to 1538007, which is fundamentally the same issue (web origins which have dangerous privileges)

Not a sandbox escape, but rather if a signin can be forced by an attacker, then the attacker can exfiltrate any data already saved on the device that would be synced, e.g., bookmarks and passwords.

Firefox <= 60 still uses the iframe on the firstrun page. See <https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/issues/6837>. We can ask :agibson and team to prioritize switching to the new page.

As the referred to bug title says, the key is not barring web content from being part of the signin process, but rather allowing FxA to modify the signed in state of Sync "silently". If FxA is in an isolated process and WebChannel messages are sent back to a trusted process, then it seems like the trusted process should be able to show the user some UX confirming the user wants to connect to Sync as user XXX@YYY.ZZZ.

Do I understand correctly that this means only allowing connections to <https://accounts.firefox.com> from the privileged process? If so, we are going to have to undertake a re-architecture of FxA to move everything to a single domain. Currently <https://accounts.firefox.com> is only used to serve HTML and do a bit of metrics gathering. Static JS is served from a CDN at <https://accounts-static.cdn.mozilla.net>. Authentication related calls are made to <https://api.accounts.firefox.com>, OAuth related calls go to <https://oauth.accounts.firefox.com>, a user's profile is stored at <https://profile.accounts.firefox.com>, a user's profile photo is stored at <https://firefoxusercontent.com> so that invalid images cannot be used as an attack vector.

> WebChannel architecture may provides this already though?

IIRC, WebChannel listeners are created at startup and can be sent from any page, however every WebChannel has to specify an originOrPermission from which to accept messages [1]. If a WebChannel message is sent from an unrecognized origin, it's ignored. WebChannels are created on startup to prevent race conditions in channel creation whenever a tab to <https://accounts.firefox.com> is loaded. I may have this wrong though and WebChannels are created on a per-tab basis. :markh should be able to chim in more here.

> From a quick check, it looks like FxA stores a bunch of data in LocalStorage, but changing it doesn't seem to affect state

We do store a user's session state in localStorage, for Firefox Desktop's < 55 [2] and any non-Firefox desktop browser. In Firefox Desktop >= 55, whenever FxA loads we send a WebChannel request to the browser to ask which user is signed in to Sync. If a user is signed in to Sync, then that info will be shared with FxA for subsequent signings. If no user is signed in, then we read the last signed in user from localStorage. For Firefox < 55 and any non Firefox Desktop browser, we always read a user's session state from localStorage.

We also store "verification state" in localStorage, this is used to customize the UX depending on whether a user verifies their email in the same browser in which they sign up in. For OAuth flows, the same verification info is used to help redirect the appropriate tab back to an OAuth relying party whenever a user verifies their email address.

We may be able to take this even further, and only show the confirmation for "spontaneous" login attempts that originate from web content, while not showing it when the user is logging in via UI in the browser.

I suspect some users would just click "ok" to this warning message though.

Since it's not always clear to folks not steeped in how FxA works, I just want to clarify that the "we" in that last paragraph is "the web content running on accounts.firefox.com".

To be clear, in a site-isolation world, loading JS and other resources from other origins is totally fine, the only thing that'd be problematic is iframes, where you have different contexts code is running in.

I think the ideal outcome here would be to pursue *both* the site-isolation style special case, and also the changes to prompt if these messages come from web content. That provides us the most resillience.

Your idea in [Bug 1538024](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538024 "NEW") could work well here. If we are going down the OAuth route in the long run, we could go so far as to open FxA with a state token. Pass the state token back to the browser in the `login` message, and let the browser decide what to do. I'm not sure whether that's any better than tracking principals from which a `login` message should be accepted w/o extra UI, but hey.. OAuth.

So digging into the code to see how this is actually enforced, it looks like this sets up a callback ["WebChannelMessageToChrome"](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/56705678f5fc363be5e0237e1686f619b0d23009/toolkit/modules/WebChannel.jsm#92) which compares the origin that was used for setup against `event.principal`. This is start, but event in this case is the `message` (in the messageManager sense), and `message.principal`. As far as I know, until we do something like fission, there is no way we can trust this, since the data is sent from the child ([here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/ipc/ContentParent.cpp#3967) maybe? - I might be wrong here, as I would guess webchannel is build on FrameMessageManager not process message manager, but I think its same problem in both.)

So while we do check that the message comes "<https://accounts.firefox.com>", we just check that against what the child tell us. Until we have some map in place which maps content processes to the set of origins which are supposed to be loaded in that process (which I think is 1491018).

SO for isolation to be of any effect, we either need to do that, and check that the message is coming from a process that should contain '<https://accounts.firefox.com>'. OR we need to do process isolation of the blessed loading of accounts.firefox.com, and somehow ONLY listen for `WebChannelMessageToChrome` that relate to firefox accounts on from this blessed process.

Confirmed with Nika, I wasn't wrong, the child process can lie about `message.principal`.

Nika's suggestion for how we do this without [bug 1491018](/show_bug.cgi?id=1491018 "NEW - Create Authoritative 'This Origin to this Content Process' Infrastructure") was to put accounts.firefox.com into a separate process type, and just check that the message comes from the correct process type (ie these [types](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/modules/E10SUtils.jsm#45).

Discussed this over emails and calls and we believe putting accounts.firefox.com and addonz.mozilla.org in a content process separate from the web content is the best mitigation and this is doable by adding any remote type (like the existing types of 'web', 'file', 'extension',..). Jim's team can work on this while Nika can help with pointers, if needed.

I have opened [1] to remove all traces of iframe support in FxA. :agibson and team have opened (and merged) [2] to stop using the iframe in Bedrock. Once bedrock ships their change to prod, we can merge [1], and from our side there should be no more blockers to enabling site isolation for accounts.firefox.com

Great. From the Firefox side we're still trying to get a handle on how much lift that would be, versus just waiting for fission down the line.

I think [bug 1538024](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538024 "NEW") is probably the next piece that we should figure out how to make into reality.

Going through this bug I saw the following items that didn't have explicit followups:

From [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)"): addons.trustedSourceHostnames is used to ensure we don't install addons via sync from skethy sources... but this is a pref and can be overwritten by sync. So.... that seems bypassable. I imagine the correct fix for this is something in [Bug 1538015](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector") land though.

Also from [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)"): these checks only apply on write; not when pulling data from the sync server. This seems like we should take this on as an enhancement, right Ryan?

From [Comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)")/15: A malicious content process manipulating localStorage for accounts.firefox.com to affect the Sync signin process. This is the case for < 55 but otherwise seems like a remote possibility right now; but the fix for this is really over in [Bug 1484019](/show_bug.cgi?id=1484019 "NEW - [meta] Enforce Content Process Restrictions in IPC") rather than hacking on additional checks today. If we can find a specific attack vector for this though we should close it.

[Comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)"), 16: We could show a confirmation popup for web content-based sign-ins; even when it comes from the trusted content process. This is what [Bug 1538024](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538024 "NEW") is about.

While we deployed this in Nightly, it relies on a lot of in-progress Fission work and the underlying code is actually going to be swapped out soon when DocumentChannel is deployed. So we've restricted it to Nightly only at least until DocumentChannel lands. [Bug 1578742](/show_bug.cgi?id=1578742 "VERIFIED FIXED - Ship Mozilla Content Process Isolation to Beta/Release") is for shipping it out of Nightly, I've added that as a blocker.

##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

#### [#CVE-2019-11753: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location](#CVE-2019-11753)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Nathan Froyd reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2019-11736: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2019-11736)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.
*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

A compromised sandboxed content process can perform a Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS) attack on content from any site it can cause to be loaded in the same process. Because `addons.mozilla.org` and `accounts.firefox.com` have close ties to the Firefox product, malicious manipulation of these sites within the browser can potentially be used to modify a user's Firefox configuration. These two sites will now be isolated into their own process and not allowed to be loaded in a standard content process.

#### [#CVE-2019-11748: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context](#CVE-2019-11748)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact

##### Description

A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

Reporter
Thomas Henlich
Impact
low
##### Description

The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an `http:` URL rather than secure `https:` they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-26

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 68.1

Announced
September 3, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 68.1

#### [#CVE-2019-11751: Malicious code execution through command line parameters](#CVE-2019-11751)

Reporter
Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of VXRL working with iDefense Labs
Impact
critical
##### Description

Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11746: Use-after-free while manipulating video](#CVE-2019-11746)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

#### [#CVE-2019-11742: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images](#CVE-2019-11742)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

#### [#CVE-2019-11736: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2019-11736)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.
*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

* [Bug 1552206](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1552206)

#### [#CVE-2019-11753: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location](#CVE-2019-11753)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11752: Use-after-free while extracting a key value in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11752)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2019-11748: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context](#CVE-2019-11748)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

##### References

* [Bug 1564588](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588)

#### [#CVE-2019-11749: Camera information available without prompting using getUserMedia](#CVE-2019-11749)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

So, restating my understanding, the issue is now that when we are encoding a value into the key (which has a custom encoding mechanism) we have special handling for JS Arrays. At <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/fcfb479e6ff63aea017d063faa17877ff750b4e5/dom/indexedDB/Key.cpp#265> we manually traverse the array using JS\_GetElement. This is impacted by the prototype chain because we don't do any "own" magic and we lose. And because we didn't make deleteIndex() throw when there's an IDB operation on the stack, we have a use-after-free.
Xray wrappers thoughts on the subject are found in the comment above the Array special-case here:
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/fcfb479e6ff63aea017d063faa17877ff750b4e5/js/xpconnect/wrappers/XrayWrapper.cpp#536>
It looks like this is the only dangerous call for encoding given that JS\_GetArrayLength has already checked the internal class of the object and so it should not reach the dangerous GetProperty call at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/fcfb479e6ff63aea017d063faa17877ff750b4e5/js/src/builtin/Array.cpp#142> but let's involve :sfink because maybe he wants to write a bunch of cool static analyses that can help C++ code ensure that it's not triggering content-controlled JS when it doesn't want to.
:sfink, for extra context, I suggest reading the comment at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/indexedDB/Key.cpp#33> which describes how IndexedDB cleverly encodes the keys defined by the spec at <https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#key-construct>. We cleverly encode the keys into a binary representation so SQLite can just do its binary comparison thing without us needing to provide a custom collation function. (Structured Clone can't do that for us... yet... ;)Flags: needinfo?(bugmail) â†’ needinfo?(sphink)

This really ought to be caught by the static rooting hazard analysis. It currently is not.
aValue is kept live across GC calls: it's live upon entry, live across both GC calls GetJSValFromKeyPathString() and AppendItem() during the first iteration of the loop, and then consumed at the top of the second iteration. It's not reported by the analysis because the analysis sees const Value& as Value\*, and that's a pointer to a pointer encoded in a Value. Pointers to pointers don't get invalidated by GC. It \*should\* be reported as a warning in the caller, but it won't because of [bug 1497593](/show_bug.cgi?id=1497593 "NEW") (not that we're good about warnings.)
(In reply to Jan Varga [:janv] from [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1501152#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in KeyPath::ExtractKey"))
> We fixed this by cloning the object before calling ExtractKey. However,
> there may be still some corner cases.
That would fix the problem where the getter removes the value or some property of it, but cloning by itself wouldn't solve the rooting problem. But I see that it's done with ValueWrapper, which contains mValue in a Rooted, so that fixes the rooting hazard.
This bug makes me think that perhaps [bug 1497593](/show_bug.cgi?id=1497593 "NEW") is not enough; that would only produce warnings in the caller that we would almost certainly ignore. (We periodically sweep through those looking for real problems, but rarely.) Conceptually, this passing of a const Value& ought to be analyzed as if we were passing a plain Value. We're only passing by reference because (1) alignment constraints make passing by value problematic, and (2) it is more efficient on 32-bit (though I'm not wholly convinced that's really true, but it makes life easier on the JIT so I won't argue.)
Then again, if I \*did\* make this change to the analysis, it would turn this case into a false positive. But it really does smell like a problem if you only look at it locally. What would be better, and would survive the intended analysis change, would be if ExtractKey took a Handle<JS::Value> instead of a const Value&. I think that should just work, since ValueWrapper hands out its Value as a Rooted<Value>&. Which, by the way, is kind of weird -- I would prefer that to be returning a Handle<Value> instead.Flags: needinfo?(sphink)

It seems, we can just replace:
if (!JS\_GetElement(aCx, obj, index, &val)) {
IDB\_REPORT\_INTERNAL\_ERR();
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INDEXEDDB\_UNKNOWN\_ERR;
}
with:
JS::RootedId id(aCx);
if (!JS\_IndexToId(aCx, index, &id)) {
IDB\_REPORT\_INTERNAL\_ERR();
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INDEXEDDB\_UNKNOWN\_ERR;
}
JS::Rooted<JS::PropertyDescriptor> desc(aCx);
if (!JS\_GetOwnPropertyDescriptorById(aCx, obj, id, &desc)) {
IDB\_REPORT\_INTERNAL\_ERR();
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INDEXEDDB\_UNKNOWN\_ERR;
}
if (!desc.object()) {
return NS\_ERROR\_DOM\_INDEXEDDB\_DATA\_ERR;
}

Andrew, I checked if JS\_GetArrayLength() and I believe it's safe. This JS code:
arr1.\_\_proto\_\_.\_\_defineGetter\_\_("length", function() {
objectStore.deleteIndex("index\_name");
return "ID\_002";
});
doesn't work, because the "length" property is not configurable.
However, the patch is a bit more complicated because of testing/web-platform/tests/IndexedDB/key-conversion-exceptions.htm
I had to add the aCallGetters argument all over to make this test pass.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Looks great! (And I'm glad you put the helper method in JS space so it can be used by all!)
Restating:
- The semantics for IDB and getters is that we want to evaluate a getter at most once when there's a getter involved \*per argument\*. The spec is aware of the impact of this and so has specified that the structured clone algorithm be invoked in the cases where multiple traversals that could trigger. For efficiency reasons, we somewhat complicate this so that add()/put()/update() do not need to perform a wasteful clone when out-of-line keys are used.
- Accordingly, the basic invariants we are trying to maintain are:
- We never call getters when we're building the key from an already-evaluated value. We require that the arrays are raw, actual arrays/whatever, not crazy getter things.
- We do not call getters on a cloned value, AKA: (aCallGetters == !valueWrapper.mCloned)
- We make at most one of the following invocations per value from content (which may mean multiples calls for multiple values in the case of IDBKeyRange, and both the value and the out-of-line key when out-of-line keys are in use): blah(...aCallGetters==true), valueWrapper.Clone().
- GetAddInfo is the interesting case because the state of ValueWrapper.mCloned can vary, and in the case where mCloned is not expected to be true at entry because we currently allow createIndex/deleteIndex to be invoked by re-entrant code and the evaluation of the out-of-line key and the value BOTH can trigger getters, whether mCloned will be invoked can change!

Unfortunately |GetOwnElement| is not a general purpose API. Depending on context one should prefer JS\_GetElement/JS\_GetProperty family or the GetOwnPropertyDescriptor family of APIs and avoid any sort of hybrid. I think for your case here you should continue to directly call GetOwnPropertyDescriptor and be explicit. Note that GetOwnPropertyDescriptor may still invoke arbitrary code if the object is a property.
If you explicitly check JS\_IsArrayObject before calling GetOwnPropertyDescriptor\* then you should be in safe territory. We can arrange a chat is at all-hands with some JS people to give some guidance on how IndexedDB code should in general interact with SpiderMonkey.

Instead, you probably want a helper function that asserts array is JS\_IsArrayObject, then use JS\_GetOwnPropertyDescriptorById. The helper should probably have a comment explaining why undefined is a the appropriate result to use for a non-data PropertyDescriptor.

You mean that there shouldn't be aCanCallGetters and just always avoid searching the prototype chain ?
Well, there is a wpt test - testing/web-platform/tests/IndexedDB/key-conversion-exceptions.htm and that proofs that sometimes we need to search the prototype chain.
You may want to look at [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=1501152#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in KeyPath::ExtractKey") and [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1501152#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in KeyPath::ExtractKey").
I don't know maybe the spec should be updated or the test fixed, but the patch should be safe because we don't allow calling getters for values logically distinct from the payload value.

Thanks for the eagle eyes on the spec, Ted! I absolutely missed that, as was probably clear from my explicitly stating in vidyo that I thought we needed to have the same side-effect semantics as structured clone for key evaluation of out-of-line keys.

I think the test is wrong. "Convert a value to a key" is very explicit. That getter should never be invoked. DataCloneError should be thrown. I suggest we change the WPT test to be correct, citing the spec.

Note, I was wrong here. After talking with Ted it turns out I missed that the test is defining a property on the test object, not the Object prototype. So HasOwnProperty will pass, and the getter will be invoked and explode with its custom exception. So the test is legit. And then there are some other nuances that Ted is writing up for our benefit that we'll receive via email soon! I just wanted to update the bug before this falls out of my brain, or in case other people reading the bug get misled.

Jan, I'm organizing a few notes to try and motivate some of the subtlety here. For this bug, I think having leaving jsapi.h alone is best. We should use JS\_GetOwnPropertyDescriptorById in the code for the |aCanCallGetters| case, but please include |MOZ\_ASSERT(JS\_IsArrayObject(...))| check for documentation.
The JS teams experience with algorithms like <https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#convert-a-value-to-a-key> is to go step by step tracking the spec as comments, and if there are optimizations to justify why they are valid. See <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/55895c49f55073d82d977cb74ec1d3a71ae4b25f/js/src/builtin/Stream.cpp#753> for an example of the detailed steps.
For this bug, I think we can focus on the sec issue by preventing the getter from being called in the specific case. I can help review a helper method (put in indexeddb) that uses JS\_GetOwnPropertyDescriptorById to avoid calling getters and combines the HasOwnProperty and Get steps from the spec.

I'll take this over.

First thing, I'll try to refactor the code to be more similar to the spec's control flow and add corresponding excerpts (probably under a different bug number, since it shouldn't look too suspicious). Then I'll fix the wrong JS object accesses here, and finally, see if there's a way to avoid creating a cloned JS object while still maintaining the correctness of the whole thing. I suspect that by weaving key path traversal into the serialization code this would be possible, but let's only do that once correctness and safety are established.

FWIW, I did propose weaving key path traversal into the serialization, but it added a lot of complexity and potentially required performance-hindering alterations to the JS engine's structured clone logic.

(Specifically, if there was a mechanism for something to listen to the the serialization process, say using the visitor idiom, it could maintain an understanding of the current "path" and capture values at the right path points. Where capturing values could entail listening to further nested traversal. However, I believe I was erroneously assuming that the existing structured clone ops already provided the visibility we needed. I believe reality is that the hooks are not called during normal plain object serialization, and so would need to be made more generic. This was deemed undesirable for complexity reasons and because structured cloning is generally performance-sensitive.)

Small update: I'm still working on this; making control flow as close as possible to the spec without touching the lower-level implementation details is a little tricky here.

We would probably need to consider more hooks into the structured clone algorithm, though. It seems to be used as a basic building block for optimization-ripe spec operations. There are ways to mitigate potential performance problems for non-specialized use cases (e.g. have versions with and without hooks instantiated from a template), so it would probably boil down to the trade-off between implementation complexity and some DOM components' performance.

This is going to miss the 67/60.7.0esr releases. If you think we may come up with a fix and it would drive a dot release, we can keep tracking for 67. Otherwise we should wontfix it and move the flags to 68.

I'm following tcampbell's recommendations concerning this bug, and they necessitate a bigger-ish refactoring of the surrounding code, including iteration on the design of several classes. I'm not sure it would make sense as a point release.

Hi Daniel,

The fix for this issue has been landed by pretending itself to be a cleanup in [bug 1544750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1544750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor IndexedDB's add() and put() operations to make correspondence to spec clearer"). Since this is not the general procedure for security issue (at least I couldn't find a document for this), I have a few questions for the status of this bug. Would you mind giving me some feedback? Thanks!

My questions here are:

* Can we close this bug now? And would it be safe if we set any dependency between this and [bug 1544750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1544750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor IndexedDB's add() and put() operations to make correspondence to spec clearer") now? (e.g. duplicate or see also)
* Should we uplift the patches in [bug 1544750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1544750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor IndexedDB's add() and put() operations to make correspondence to spec clearer") to Beta since this is a sec-high issue from your perspective? (I wouldn't recommend doing that since the patches also refactor surrounding code)

One problem with with hiding security fixes in unrelated bugs is that it completely bypasses the [sec-approval process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process) which would have answered some of those questions, as well as explored potential solutions to problems such as "if we can't uplift this to Beta, how the heck are we going to secure ESR-68 for the next year it's supported?" This process is linked to in the warning text "sec-approval required on patches before landing" in the attachments area of this bug.

We need to mark this bug FIXED so it triggers the proper advisory and bug bounty treatment. Linking them now is OK.

So now what? If we wait until Firefox 70 ships that's late October which is pretty long for a sec-high fix to sit in the tree. We've done that before but this patch looks fairly straightforward, if large, so maybe it's safe to backport? We definitely need to backport to ESR-68 branch anyway.

We're also still supporting ESR-60. How complex would it be to backport to that? I can't imagine IndexedDB has changed much.

Tom, are we sure that [Bug 1544750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1544750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor IndexedDB's add() and put() operations to make correspondence to spec clearer") covered all the cases for this bug? For example, [1] still can run arbitrary JS which is what the spec allows. This fixes the prototype stuff (and we now better follow spec), but is the re-entrancy issue addressed in other ways?

I see. Thanks for the explanation! I will try to ask the sec-approval in the security bug for the patches in the unrelated bugs if I have similar condition next time. So that, we can also cover this problem.

It makes sense to backport it to ESR-68, but it's better to observe the status for the patch on the Nightly for a while (a week). If the patch is stable (there is no new issues related to that for a week), then I will check and try to uplift the patch to ESR-68.

> We're also still supporting ESR-60. How complex would it be to backport to that? I can't imagine IndexedDB has changed much.

I rebased both part1 and part2 on [Bug 1544750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1544750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor IndexedDB's add() and put() operations to make correspondence to spec clearer"). There are some conflicts on dom/indexedDB/ActorsParent.cpp and dom/indexedDB/Key.cpp. I'll take a closer look (checking the changes on IDBKey after ESR60 til now since patches on [Bug 1544750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1544750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor IndexedDB's add() and put() operations to make correspondence to spec clearer") refactor the code there) next week when I rebase the patches to ESR68.

Also, we still need to check the performance impact after applying the patches on [Bug 1544750](/show_bug.cgi?id=1544750 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor IndexedDB's add() and put() operations to make correspondence to spec clearer").

Keep the ni flag to remind me of checking the complexity of backporting to 60 next week.

Ah, sorry for the confusion. I was thinking this bug is mainly for the prototype stuff and the rest of the works should be taken care of in other bugs. And I was wrong. I'll ensure that we have taken all the cases before closing this security bug. Thanks for the notice!

In the strictest sense, the re-entrancy issue is already addressed by cloning the value, which strips getters. By avoiding the prototype chain, I believe the security hole is plugged. The PoC posted on this issue doesn't produce an ASan message for me any more.

I think there are still some theoretical edge cases in spidermonkey, I don't remember exactly, maybe when some wrappers or proxies are involved, so long term it would be safer to fix [bug 1570585](/show_bug.cgi?id=1570585 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME").

Quick update: the plan for uplift is that if I/Yaron can implement a quick & simple fix for [bug 1570585](/show_bug.cgi?id=1570585 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME") (I have a naive plan for fixing that in mind, but it need to be verified), then maybe it's better to uplift the patch there to Beta or ESR since I expect the patch there would be smaller and should also fix the issue here. If we cannot make it, I would suggest just uplifting patches here.

Jan (and Ted, privately) are correct, I forgot about the possibility of using proxies. So this is not fixed yet.

Back-flipping yet again, step 23 of [StructuredSerializeInternal](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/structured-data.html#structuredserializeinternal) makes clones of objects with proxies impossible, so I once again think this is actually fixed in m-c. I think this highlights the need for a systematic approach to dealing with [bug 1570585](/show_bug.cgi?id=1570585 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME").

[Bug 1544750 - Part 2: Refactor Key::EncodeJSValInternal to show direct correspondence to spec r=asuth,tcampbell](attachment.cgi?id=9087298)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9087298&action=edit)

This commit adds the text of the spec as inline comments and refactors

the code such that it directly corresponds to the spec's steps. This

makes it easier to understand how the spec's algorithm is implemented.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: Potentially exploitable use-after-free
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: It's been on nightly and we haven't seen regressions.
* **String changes made/needed**: None

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Easy to trigger UAF, not sure how easy it is to exploit
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: esr68
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It's possible that it introduces regressions since it's a new implementation of existing functionality, but it's been on nightly and we haven't seen any regressions.

Can you clarify the status for esr60? The sec-approval says this only goes back as far as esr68, but [comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=1501152#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Use after free in KeyPath::ExtractKey") says esr60 is also affected. Also, updating the flags to reflect that this is fixed in 70 already.

Update: it does not apply cleanly, so this may require more work and testing.

[Bug 1554989 - Fix implicit checker on inheriting constructors r=andi](attachment.cgi?id=9088091) (obsolete)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9088091&action=edit)

Inheriting constructors are implicitly introduced via a using-declaration.

Since the C++ grammar doesn't allow attributes on using-declarations, it

is currently impossible to add MOZ\_IMPLICIT to implicit inheriting

constructors.

This commit changes the AST matcher such that it ignores inheriting

constructors altogether. If they are inheriting from an implicit inherited

constructor, that constructor's check should be enough to ensure that no

constructors are unintentionally implicit.

This commit adds the text of the spec as inline comments and refactors

the code such that it directly corresponds to the spec's steps. This

makes it easier to understand how the spec's algorithm is implemented.

Andrew, can you sanity-check this?

There were some conflicts in Key.cpp around [bug 1499854](/show_bug.cgi?id=1499854 "RESOLVED FIXED - Assertion failure: (typeOffset % eArray == 0) && (typeOffset / eArray <= 2), at /builds/worker/workspace/build/src/dom/indexedDB/Key.cpp:195"), and a dependency on [bug 1429613](/show_bug.cgi?id=1429613 "RESOLVED FIXED - Variant::match accepting lambdas, or one generic lambda") for IDBResult (the latter fixed by janv with <https://paste.mozilla.org/1CY8myH6>). This applies on top of <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e8c59393c809> (which grafts cleanly to esr60).

patch for esr60

-----------------------------------------------------------------
So, it turns out I also can't actually build esr60 on my machine, but I can certify this as sane and resembling the code I previously reviewed. (It seems like rustc 1.36.0 is probably too recent, but I'm very wary of messing with any default build toolchains right now because it might invalidate some of my other-secbug rr traces.)

I have rustc 1.36.0 too and I can build it. However, one need to do this before configure/build:

export RUSTFLAGS="--cap-lints warn"

to workaround [bug 1519629](/show_bug.cgi?id=1519629 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stylo fails with --enable-warnings-as-errors using Rust 1.33"), this was all discovered by Julien (thanks for the investigation).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

In light of [bug 1538008](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)") we should re-think the way we sync preferences.

In particular, process and debugging prefs that are often platform dependent anyway are dangerous to sync.

Seems like an initial first step would be to limit the synced prefs to pref roots starting with:

```
accessibility.
browser.
lightweightThemes.
privacy.
network.cookie.
services.sync.syncedTabs.showRemoteIcons
signon.rememberSignons
spellchecker.dictionary

```

with explicit blocks for anything under `browser.remote` and `browser.safebrowsing`, perhaps with followup bugs to move those prefs somewhere else so we can remove the blocklist approach.

Could also do with a follow-up that allows syncing privacy.resistFingerprinting.\* to turn it **on**, but doesn't allow syncing to turn it **off**, though how we'd implement that, I dunno.

This isn't a panacea because people adding security-sensitive prefs under browser. can still create holes, but it's better than nothing (and we can't really prevent people adding these, sadly?).

Note that there's a few synced-by-default things that I'm deliberately not including (some `security.` , `xpinstall.whitelist.required`, for one) that I think just need removing from the list of default synced items. I think that's the right tradeoff; people can still set these prefs themselves and enterprises have other ways of enforcing them that don't involve sync.

Johann, does that sound sane? Am I missing a better plan?

I think limiting like that makes some sense, but, to take a step back, what makes us use preferences for this instead of a hard-coded list anyway? Has anyone ever needed to modify this on the fly, without touching m-c code? Could there be a chrome (parent) only API that stores these in memory for testing, then?

I'm trying to understand where the requirement for a pref list of things to sync comes from. Maybe that will also help us design the right security model for it.

|  | |

So, to answer my own question, the requirement may come from the fact that the user can choose different categories of settings to sync in about:preferences. Could we just make prefs for these (on my Nightly 8) categories and hard code their pref values?

Ryan, do you have any thoughts/further insights on that? :)

(In reply to Johann Hofmann [:johannh] from [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector"))

No, these prefs are all specifically about syncing preferences, so "sub items" as it were of the "Preferences" checkbox that shows up in the 6/7/8 checkboxes in the, uh, preferences. To keep it confusing.

That is, when you sync preferences, we don't sync **all** preferences. That would be a Bad Idea. Instead, we sync a subset.

The subset is/was user-alterable, with some sensible defaults defined.

Removing the ability for users to alter these and keep the list in a jsm or whatever would be possible, but people do modify these lists themselves on an ad-hoc basis when people add new preferences and forget to add them to sync's list, or when there are longstanding / hidden preferences that they want to sync themselves but that we'd never sync from a product perspective. We could decide not to are about that usecase in favour of security, I guess, but I'm not convinced that really buys us much beside user outrage.

How about allowing users to continue using these prefs to turn syncing a pref *off*, but not add new prefs? I.e. only support the "false" state of the sync prefs?

I mean, the default is false unless we ship a value true for it, so this amounts to restricting the list to items for which we ship a default "sync this" pref, right?

As additional context, I suppose part of the raison d'etre of the existing system is that old-style add-ons could define prefs of their own that they might want synced. That's obviously not a concern anymore now that we're webextensions only.

Yeah, that's the idea, my suggestion was simply to dampen the impact on folks who would like to be able to turn off syncing certain prefs.

I agree. Some sandboxing prefs might be valid on Windows, but break the browser on Mac (for example.)

Can we limit the sync'd prefs to just those settable via about:preferences?

People manually setting things in about:config are the more rare advanced users right? And we can add a note in the about:config warning that only prefs set via about:preferences are synced.

My understanding is that webextension prefs aren't stored in the regular preference infrastructure, but elsewhere, so this is no longer a concern. Rob, can you confirm?

> My understanding is that webextension prefs aren't stored in the regular preference infrastructure, but elsewhere, so this is no longer a concern. Rob, can you confirm?

This is correct. Extensions cannot directly access any pref; they have to use the [`browser.storage.sync`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync) API to save data that needs to be synchronized across devices.

Some extension APIs also change well-known prefs (see <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=symbol:ExtensionPreferencesManager%23addSetting&redirect=false> ), but all of these preference names are static.

Thunderbird will receive the ability to *read* prefs for the sake of migrating prefs to extension storage ([bug 1538590](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538590 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Webextensions API to migrate legacy prefs")), but sync is probably not relevant there.

> Paul, can you offer some guidance how we should proceed here?

Well if we are in agreement that only allowing syncing a subset of prefs is a acceptable mitigation, then we just need to define what the list is, and then change the sync code such that we sync a whitelist of pref branches. IIUC, we currently only sync preferences that are listed under services.sync.prefs.sync.\* [1]. So I assume the way forward here would be to:

a) create a new pref like `services.sync.engine.pref.whitelist` which is a whitelist of pref branches that are allowed to be sync

b) when we load prefs from sync, filter the list of prefs to be load to only those which match the whitelist (and of course, prohibit loading of `services.sync.engine.pref.whitelist` itself

So then we just need a whitelist. Gijs posted a start in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector"), but I started going through browser.\* and actually there seem to be a lot of preferences which would potentially be dangerous in the content process. For example, I assume change browser.hiddenWindowChromeURL would change the URL which is loaded when you start Firefox on OSX. Any pref that has a chrome: URI as its value would surely be dangerous to allow the child process to set.

HOWEVER! The bigger problem for me is 1538024. The fundamental issue is that that the content process should NOT be allowed to set preferences. And therefore the child process must not be allowed to login to sync (or otherwise change sync state in such a way that causes pref changes). We will always have risks when the content process can set arbitrary prefs (even under a whitelist of branches).

So what I am saying here is that if we can implement this filter in a relatively simple way (using the list from [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector")) that we don't think will cause breakage, then it might be worth it as a defense in depth control, but its only a secondary control. But if I had to choose I'd say we should focus on 1538024 as the fix for this issue.

[1] What is services.engine.sync.prefs though?

Sorry Paul, I should have been clearer. I'm not really in agreement about this - many people find this useful and there are many articles on the internet explaining how to customize this so any pref you choose can be synced.

That said though, I understand we want to keep users safe. So I guess I'm asking whether we feel the risks here outweigh the benefits this facility offers to a small-but-vocal subset of our users? Should some of the "dangerous" prefs mentioned in [bug 1538008](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)") be unavailable in the release channel instead, thereby also avoiding social-engineering attacks?

We need to do *something* in the short term. I think that the only way that we could justify NOT doing something in this bug, is if we have a short term solution for the either the "move privileged content to a trusted process" ([bug 1538008](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008 "RESOLVED FIXED - [ ZDI-CAN-8375] UXSS priv-esc via sync (install arbitrary extensions & set arbitrary preferences)")) , or the "prompt the user when a sync change is triggered from web content ([bug 1538024](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538024 "NEW")).

Note the solution I was proposing in [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015#c15 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector") is something where power users could still disable the whitelist if they REALLY want to sync obscure prefs. They might still complain as would need to remove the whitelist manually (since we wouldn't sync `services.sync.engine.pref.whitelist` or whatever we call it) but they technically still COULD.

Implementing a blacklist I guess is better that *nothing* (like blocking `security.*`, for example) but I'm sure there are many other vectors. If you know of pref branches that people like to set, then perhaps we could expand the whitelist from [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector"), but I think it needs to be a whitelist to be at all effective as a control.

PS it might be worth taking the question back up to 1538008, since the choice of doing this bug or not depends on the other solutions somewhat. Though ultimately, I really feel that pissing off a few vocal users is worth protecting our wider userbase.

I've got a patch which I just put up for initial feedback, but thought I should discuss the approach here too.

It combines the allowlist-in-a-pref from Paul and the general approach of Gijs. Specifically:

* There's a "blocklist" which is hard-coded in javascript, so can't be changed by the user.
* There's a "allowlist" which is stored in a preference, so can be changed by the user. However, this preference itself is not synced, so the user must make adjustments to this preference manually on each device.
* The blocklist is consulted first, and the allowlist next.
* The default for the allowlist is such that all preferences we setup to sync by default are allowed.

So what's in these lists?

* The blocklist has the allowlist preference, plus "browser.safebrowsing." and "browser.remote." - I added the latter because Gijs mentioned it in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector"), although I couldn't find any "browser.remote." preferences?

Note also that this means removing the following preferences:

> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.browser.safebrowsing.phishing.enabled", true);
>
> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled", true);
>
> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.browser.safebrowsing.downloads.enabled", true);
>
> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.browser.safebrowsing.passwords.enabled", true);

so not only are these prefs no longer synced by default, they simply can not be synced. Some sites recommend setting these prefs to false for privacy reasons. However, I think it's easy to make a case that they should be blocklisted.

* While creating the allowlist I ended up deleting a few preference which don't seem to be used these days, along with `xpinstall.whitelist.required` due to potential harm. These deletions are:

> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.xpinstall.whitelist.required", true);
>
> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.addons.ignoreUserEnabledChanges", true);
>
> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.extensions.personas.current", true);
>
> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.pref.advanced.images.disable\_button.view\_image", true);
>
> pref("services.sync.prefs.sync.pref.advanced.javascript.disable\_button.advanced", true);

which results in the following allowlist:

> accessibility.
>
> browser.
>
> dom.disable media.
>
> dom.event.contextmenu.
>
> layout.spellcheckDefault
>
> network.cookie.
>
> extensions.update.enabled
>
> intl.accept\_languages
>
> permissions.default.image
>
> pref.downloads.disable\_button.
>
> pref.privacy.disable\_button.
>
> privacy.
>
> security.default\_personal\_cert
>
> security.OCSP.
>
> security.tls.version.
>
> services.sync.syncedTabs.
>
> signon.rememberSignons
>
> spellchecker.

which is a bit longer than ideal and what Gijs offered, but reducing it any further means also preventing the syncing of preferences which we sync *by default* now, which I'm a little reluctant to do without concrete harm being identified so we avoid annoying our users any more than we must. However, it's all obviously on the table for discussion.

> Could also do with a follow-up that allows syncing privacy.resistFingerprinting.\* to turn it **on**, but doesn't allow syncing to turn it **off**, though how we'd implement that, I dunno.

TBH I'm really not that bothered by that - it doesn't seem likely someone would attempt to use what we are fixing here simply to enable fingerprinting.

> Note that there's a few synced-by-default things that I'm deliberately not including (some `security.` , `xpinstall.whitelist.required`, for one)

As above, I left the existing `security` prefs, but didn't allowlist the entire `security.` branch.

The patch is a little larger than it needs to be because I chose to console.warn() when there's a pref that would have been synced before this patch but no longer is - users who haven't enabled custom prefs will never see this warning and users who have might appreciate an indication of what's going on.

So Ive had a quick look through the prefs we allow here - there are some semi-dangerous ones I think, but we a never going to be fully safe here. One thing to note however is that Tom has been able to develop the patch to isolate accounts.firefox.com into a separate process. See <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1539595#c9>

But in light of that, we should have a think about whether we should still do this - since this was always considered a stopgap measure. On one hand, I would prefer we did this, as an additional control for this type of issue (assuming that it doesn't break use cases). On the other hand, maybe its not worth the added engineering complexity that this change adds.

Or maybe we might just implement a less severe version of the block/allow list.

Just a note: Ive been chatting with Mark on irc and I realised that the current patch misses some of the "dangerous" prefs from the original PoC in 1538008 [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector")

In that chat, we came up with a far simpler proposal.

* A new preference, say "services.sync.prefs.dangerously\_allow\_arbitrary" has a default value of false.
* If that preference is false, we treat the "services.sync.prefs.sync." branch as a whitelist - if that pref doesn't already exist locally, we refuse to take the preference. This is different to how it works now - we now happily take new incoming "control" prefs.
* If that new preference is true, we work as we work now - trust anything, block nothing.
* There's no blacklist - we don't even need to blacklist that new preference, we just need to ensure we never enable it by default or create a "control" pref for it (although if we want to guard against accidents we could treat it as a 1-item blocklist)

This means that by default, we only sync prefs that we've shipped as being OK to sync (ie, [these prefs](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/app/profile/firefox.js#1179-1280))

Most users will see no change and the tiny fraction of users who leverage this have 2 options:

1. Manually create control preferences for the prefs they want to sync on both devices. For users who have many custom prefs, this will be a PITA and effectively kills the feature for them. However, it would allow (say) enterprises to expand that list fairly easily in a safe way.
2. Manually flip "services.sync.prefs.dangerously\_allow\_arbitrary" on each of their devices. Once flipped, things work for them exactly like they do now.

We'd recommend people use (1) and strongly advise against using (2) (and hopefully the pref name kinda speaks for itself)

Thoughts?

Sorry for the delay Mark, lost this bug when traveling (Im behind in bugmail). As discussed I think this is a nice solution - basically it just means an even stricter whitelist for regular users. I've done a quick review of the list of prefs and I can't see any obvious attack vectors - some avenue for inconvenience, but if you have a compromised sync account, you are already in a world of inconvenience. So sounds like a good plan to me. Some things to keep in mind is how we prevent people from adding dangerous prefs to this list (but I expect thats just a part of regular review process). Let do it.

Release Note Request (optional, but appreciated)

[Why is this notable]: This is a change in behaviour for advanced users of sync. The old behaviour is documented on various sites which we don't control.

[Affects Firefox for Android]: No

[Suggested wording]: The way non-default preferences are synced has changed. Please see [sumo link] for more.

[Links (documentation, blog post, etc)]: I'm currently working with sumo to get a link, but thought I'd get this flag set asap.

[Bug 1538015](/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015 "VERIFIED FIXED - Revisit pref sync in to mitigate sandbox escape vector") (part 2) - restrict when incoming synced prefs are applied.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: Mitigation for sandbox escape will not exist.

It's my understanding that this patch is desired in esr68, so I'm requesting beta uplift now. If the risk is too great, then maybe this could be considered an esr68 request? (Apologies for not being sure about the correct process here)

* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: Yes
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: Yes
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: Ideally some QA to ensure preferences syncing still works correctly
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Risk is limited to preferences syncing.
* **String changes made/needed**:

I verified this on Mac OS X 10.14, Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 10 with FF Nightly 69.0a1(2019-06-29) and FF Beta 68.0b14 and I can confirm the fact that the sync between the prefs works as expected.

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

Julien: why was this wontfixed for esr-60? this is one of the ways to break/hinder one of the pwn2own sandbox-escapes that ZDI is going to blog about. Resetting tracking flags to see if there was more behind this or if it was just a reflexive response to "not sec-high".

It was a response to "not sec-high, behaviour change that might break stuff for people, late in the esr60 lifecycle". If we want to take it anyway because it's going to go public, that's fine.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: mitigating sec-high/crit sandbox escaping paths
* **User impact if declined**: see above
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 69, uplift to 68
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: I mean, it's late in the cycle, yada yada, but at least there's some automated testing, it won't affect anyone except people who use sync, and even there I wouldn't expect it to affect anyone unless they rely on syncing unknown prefs, and there the impact is pretty much what we want it to be - or so we hope. It's had a good amount of baking on nightly/beta and I'm not aware of any issues. Plus, there are easy workarounds (ie pref flips) that we could deploy quickly if things really did go pearshaped. Last but not least, green trypush!
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: nope
