Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9949:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `cgi-bin/webfile_mgr.cgi` script, which handles file management functionalities on the Western Digital My Cloud devices, is vulnerable to command injection. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the `name` parameter passed to the `cgi_unzip` command. Specifically, the pipe character (`|`) was not being escaped, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   The `cgi-bin/webfile_mgr.cgi` also does not properly handle symbolic links when extracting archives, allowing an attacker to create symlinks to arbitrary paths, which can later be used to write to arbitrary locations on the file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The lack of proper sanitization of the `name` parameter in the `cgi_unzip` command allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands with root privileges.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** By exploiting the symbolic link creation vulnerability within the archive extraction process (specifically with `cgi_untar`), attackers can create symlinks to any directory and then write data into them, potentially overwriting system files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can achieve remote code execution as root on the affected Western Digital My Cloud devices by injecting commands via the `cgi_unzip` parameter or by overwriting the tar binary itself with a malicious payload using the symlink attack.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, attackers can take complete control of the device, including accessing and manipulating sensitive data, installing malware, or using the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable My Cloud device.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/cgi-bin/webfile_mgr.cgi` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Archive:** The attacker provides an archive file and injects shell commands through its name during the extraction using `cgi_unzip` or creates malicious symlinks via `cgi_untar`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the target device.
*   **Low-Privilege Session:**  While not a strict requirement for the command injection vulnerability, a low-privilege session acquired through the "nobody" account (CVE-2019-9950) is needed for the symlink attack and accessing file management features.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know that `cgi-bin/webfile_mgr.cgi` is the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided write-up details how the attacker can use an empty password for the "nobody" account to obtain a low-privilege session, which is then leveraged to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker could overwrite the `/bin/tar` file with a custom payload, which is later executed by calling `cgi_untar`.
*   The vulnerability was patched in firmware version 2.31.183.
