  "CVE-2019-9745": {
    "Description": "The provided documents describe a vulnerability in the CloudCTI Recognition Configuration Tool. The vulnerability allows a local attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges by exploiting a combination of flaws. The main issues are a lack of message confidentiality and integrity, allowing message tampering, and an insecure implementation of an external application execution feature. A crafted JSON message can be sent over a named pipe to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient validation of data, specifically within the communication between the CloudCTI GUI application and its service, as well as a lack of proper verification when executing an external application specified in the message.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of confidentiality for communication between the GUI and the service.",
      "Lack of authorization checks on messages sent to the service.",
      "Absence of source verification for messages sent to the service.",
      "Insecure execution of an external application specified in the messages, without any verification."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can fully compromise the local system, including the ability to execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges, access all resources, and potentially take over the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access is required, as the attacker needs to send a crafted JSON message via a named pipe to the CloudCTI service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send messages to the named pipe and have knowledge of the message format, including the ability to specify the external program execution.",
    "Additional Details": {
        "Exploitation Details": "The attacker needs to observe the communications, reverse engineer their structure, craft a malicious message including a batch script (or any other executable) as a value for a field called ExporterApplication, and send it through the named pipe. The target system would then execute the malicious program with SYSTEM privileges.",
         "Mitigation Details": "The vendor mitigated the vulnerability by encrypting the messages with a shared secret, verifying the source of messages, and cryptographically signing the external application. This ensures message confidentiality and integrity, authentication, non-repudiation, and stops arbitrary code execution. ",
        "Affected Software": "CloudCTI Recognition Configuration Tool",
        "CVSS Score": "8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C)"
