{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Infinite recursion in the `check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1` function within the glibc regex module.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `check_dst_limits_calc_pos_1` function enters an infinite recursion when processing a crafted regular expression pattern with backreferences. This leads to a stack overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A stack overflow due to infinite recursion, leading to a segmentation fault and program termination.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted regular expression to a program using the vulnerable glibc regex module, specifically via `grep -E`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to control the regular expression pattern passed to the `regexec` function."
