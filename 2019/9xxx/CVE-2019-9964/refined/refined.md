The provided content describes multiple crashes in XnView Classic 2.48 and XnView MP 0.93.1, discovered through fuzzing. It lists crash details with Windbg outputs, and mentions the corresponding CVEs, including CVE-2019-9964.

Based on the information available in this blog post, here's the breakdown for CVE-2019-9964:

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is not explicitly stated, but based on the provided information it's caused by improper handling of image data leading to crashes within the applications. The specific crashes related to CVE-2019-9964 are described as follows:

*   **XnView MP 0.93.1:**
    *   `VCRUNTIME140!memcpy`: A crash occurs in the `memcpy` function, likely due to an invalid size or destination address.
    *   `ntdll!RtlFreeHeap`: A crash during heap deallocation, suggesting a double free or invalid pointer.
    *   `ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey`: A crash inside the temporary key creation function, indicating an issue with resource allocation or manipulation.
    *  `ntdll!RtlReAllocateHeap`: A crash during heap reallocation, potentially caused by incorrect metadata or buffer handling.
*   **XnView Classic 2.48:**
    *   `xnview+0x38536c`: A crash occurs during a `movdqa` instruction, suggesting an issue with data alignment or access violation.
     *  `ntdll!RtlPrefixUnicodeString`: A crash inside the `RtlPrefixUnicodeString` function, likely caused by invalid pointer or string handling.
    *   `ntdll!RtlQueueWorkItem`: A crash occurs during queuing work item, suggesting an issue with threading or task management.
    *   `xnview+0x385399`: A crash occurs due to an invalid memory access, similar to the previous one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerabilities stem from memory corruption issues such as:
*   Heap corruption (double frees, invalid reallocations).
*   Buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes in memory copy operations.
*   Invalid memory access due to incorrect pointers.

**Impact of exploitation**: The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities is denial of service due to application crashes.

**Attack vectors**: The attack vector is by opening specially crafted image files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious image file to the vulnerable application.
