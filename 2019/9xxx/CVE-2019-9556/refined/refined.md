Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9556:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The Fiberhome AN5506-04-F router's web application does not properly filter user-supplied input. Malicious input is stored and later displayed without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores unsanitized user input, specifically in the "account_user" field during user creation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the user's browser session when the malicious data is rendered by the web application. An attacker can perform malicious actions, such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing sensitive information, or modifying website content, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the Fiberhome AN5506-04-F router. Specifically, by injecting a malicious script into the `account_user` parameter when creating a new user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web management interface of the Fiberhome AN5506-04-F router (typically via the local network).
- The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to the management interface (likely default credentials could be used).
- The attacker needs to create a new user account or edit user information via a specific page which is vulnerable.
