Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the CoreFTP Server's FTP service when handling the `SIZE` command. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize or validate the file path provided with the `SIZE` command, allowing directory traversal sequences like `..\..\` to navigate outside of the intended root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal, which is enabled by the lack of proper input validation for the file path provided with the `SIZE` command.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not a direct data breach, the vulnerability allows attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files on the server, which can be used for reconnaissance to find valuable target files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Existence Enumeration:** An attacker can determine if a specific file exists on the server by observing the response to the SIZE command. A '213' response followed by a file size indicates the file exists, while a different response means the file is not found or cannot be accessed.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** By enumerating the file system, attackers could find files containing credentials, configuration settings, or other sensitive data that could enable further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **FTP `SIZE` Command:** The attack vector is the use of the FTP `SIZE` command with a crafted path containing `..\..\` sequences to traverse directories.
- **Network Access:** Requires network access to the FTP service on port 21.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target FTP server.
- **Basic FTP Knowledge:** The attacker must be familiar with the basic FTP protocol, specifically the `SIZE` command.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided examples and Metasploit module suggest that the vulnerability can be exploited even without valid FTP login credentials (anonymous access).
- **Ability to Send Crafted Commands:** The attacker needs to send a specially crafted FTP SIZE command with a directory traversal sequence.
