Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `ProxyServlet.doProxy()` function of Zimbra Collaboration Suite. The vulnerability stems from flawed admin checks in this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSRF:** The `ProxyServlet` allows proxying requests to other locations based on the `target` parameter.
*   **Flawed Admin Check:** The check to determine if a request is coming from an admin is flawed.
    *   The function uses `ServletRequest.getServerPort()`, which can be spoofed by controlling the Host header (specifically the part after the colon).
    *   The admin token is only checked if provided via a parameter, but it can be sent via cookie which bypasses the check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Request Proxying:** An attacker can bypass the intended access controls and proxy requests to arbitrary internal targets that are otherwise accessible only to admins. This includes accessing the admin SOAP API running on port 7071.
*   **Pre-Auth RCE Chain:** Combined with other vulnerabilities, the SSRF can be used as part of a pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack chain. This can lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `ProxyServlet` endpoint.
*   **Host Header Spoofing:** The attacker manipulates the Host header to include the admin port (7071) to bypass the port check.
*   **Cookie-Based Admin Token:** The attacker sends a valid admin token via a cookie to bypass the token parameter check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Zimbra instance.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must understand how to construct HTTP requests and manipulate headers.
*   **Valid User Token (for preauth RCE):** To exploit the full preauth RCE chain, the attacker requires a normal user token which can be acquired through a separate step by leveraging the 'zimbra' account using the described method
*   **Knowledge of Zimbra APIs:** To construct valid SOAP requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post provides more technical details on how to exploit this vulnerability, and how it fits within the larger pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) chain.
*   The vulnerability can be used to access the admin SOAP API (port 7071) by sending a valid admin token in the cookie and using the spoofed host header.
*   The exploit is present in Zimbra versions from 8.5 to 8.7.11.
*   Patches have been released for affected versions of Zimbra to mitigate this issue. The suggested workaround is to block public access to '/service/proxy\*'.
