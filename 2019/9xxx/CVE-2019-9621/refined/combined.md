### A Saga of Code Executions on Zimbra

Zimbra is well known for its signature email product, Zimbra Collaboration Suite. Putting client-side vulnerabilities aside, Zimbra seems to have very little [security history](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories) in the past. Its last critical bug was a Local File Disclosure back in 2013.

Recently with several new findings, it has been known that at least one potential Remote Code Execution exists in all versions of Zimbra. Specifically,

- Pre-Auth RCE on Zimbra <8.5.

- Pre-Auth RCE on Zimbra from 8.5 to 8.7.11.

- Auth'd RCE on Zimbra 8.8.11 and below with an additional condition that Zimbra uses Memcached. More on that in [the next section](#memcached_condition).

## Breaking Zimbra part 1

### 1. The XXE cavalry - CVE-2016-9924, CVE-2018-20160, CVE-2019-9670

Zimbra uses a large amount of XML handling for both its internal and external operations. With great XML usage comes great XXE vulnerabilities.

Back in 2016, another researcher discovered CVE-2016-9924 with the bug locating in SoapEngine.chooseFaultProtocolFromBadXml(), which happens on the parsing of invalid XML requests. This code is used in all Zimbra instances version below 8.5. Note however, as there's no way to extract the output to the HTTP response, an out-of-band extraction method is required in exploiting it.

For more recent versions, CVE-2019-9670 works flawlessly where the XXE lies in the handling of Autodiscover requests. This can be applied on Zimbra from 8.5 to 8.7.11. And for the sake of completeness, CVE-2018-20160 is an XXE in the handling of XMPP protocol and an additional bug along CVE-2019-9670 is a prevention bypass in the sanitizing of XHTML documents which also leads to XXE, however they both require some additional conditions to trigger. These all allow direct file extraction through response.

It's worth to mention that exploiting out-of-band XXE on recent Java just got a lot harder due to a patch in the core FtpClient which makes it reject all FTP commands containing newline. This doesn't affect the exploits for the vulnerabilities mentioned above, but it did make some of my previous efforts to chain XXE with other bugs in vain.

*sun.net.ftp.impl.FtpClient*

On installation, Zimbra sets up a global admin for its internal SOAP communications, with the username 'zimbra' and a randomly generated password. These information are always stored in a local file named localconfig.xml. As such, a file-read vulnerability like XXE could potentially be catastrophic to Zimbra, since it allows an attacker to acquire the login information of a user with all the admin rights. This has been demonstrated as the case in a [CVE-2013-7091 LFI exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/30472) where under certain conditions, one could use such credentials to gain RCE.

However things have never been that easy. Zimbra manages user privileges via tokens, and it sets up an application model such that an admin token can only be granted to requests coming to the admin port, which by default is 7071. The aforementioned LFI exploit conveniently assumes we already have access to that port. But how often do you see the weirdo 7071 open to public?

### 2. SSRF to the rescue - CVE-2019-9621

If you can't access the port from public, let the application do it for you. The code at ProxyServlet.doProxy() does exactly what its name says, it proxies a request to another designated location. What's more, this servlet is available on the normal webapp and therefore accessible from public. Sweet! However the code has an additional protection, it checks whether the proxied target matches a set of predefined whitelisted domains. That is, unless the request is from an admin. Sounds right, an admin should be able to do what he wants.

(Un)Fortunately, the admin checks are flawed. First thing it checks is whether the request comes from port 7071. However it uses [ServletRequest.getServerPort()](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getServerPort()) to fetch the incoming port. This method returns a tainted input controllable by an attacker, which is the part after ':' in the Host header. What's more, after that the check for the admin token happens only if it is fetched from a parameter, meanwhile we can totally send a token via cookie! In short, if we send a request with 'foo:7071' Host header and a valid token in cookie, we can proxy a request to arbitrary targets that is otherwise only accessible to admins.

### 3. Pre-Auth RCE from public port

ProxyServlet still needs a valid token though, so how does this fit in a preauth RCE chain? Turns out Zimbra has a 'hidden' feature that can help us generate a normal user token under the special global 'zimbra' account. When we modify an ordinary SOAP AuthRequest which looks like this:
```
...<account by="name">an</account>...
```
into this:
```
...<account by="adminName">zimbra</account>...
```
Zimbra will then lookup all the admin accounts and proceed to check the password. This is actually quite surprising because Zimbra admins and users naturally reside in two different LDAP branches. A normal AuthRequest should only touch the normal user branch, never the other. If the application wants a token for an admin, it already has port 7071 for that.

Note that while this little trick could give us a token for the 'zimbra' user, this token doesn't have any of the admin flag in it as it's not coming from port 7071. This is when ProxyServlet jumps in, which will help us to proxy another admin AuthRequest to port 7071 and obtain a global admin token.

Now that we've got everything we need. The flow is to read the config file via XXE, generate a low-priv token through a normal AuthRequest, proxy an admin AuthRequest to the local admin port via ProxyServlet and finally, use the global admin token to upload a webshell via the ClientUploader extension.

## Breaking Zimbra part 2

Zimbra has its own implementation of IMAP protocol, where it keeps a cache of the recently logged-in mailbox folders so that it doesn't have to load all the metadata from scratch next time. Zimbra serializes a user's mailbox folders to the cache on logging out and deserializes it when the same user logs in again.

It has three ways to maintain a cache: Memcached(network-based input), EhCache(memory-based) and file-based. If one fails, it tries the next in list. Of all of those, we can only hope to manipulate Memcached, and this is the condition of the exploit: Zimbra has to use Memcached as its caching mechanism. Even though Memcached is prioritized over the others, (un)fortunately on a single-server instance, the LDAP key zimbraMemcachedClientServerList isn't auto-populated, so Zimbra wouldn't know where the service is and will fail over to Ehcache. This is probably a bug in Zimbra itself, as Memcached service is up and running by default and that way it wouldn't have any data in it. On a multi-server install however, setting this key is expected as only Memcached can work accross many servers.

To check whether your Zimbra install is vulnerable, invoke this command on *every* node in the cluster and check if it returns a value:
```
$ zmprov gs `zmhostname` zimbraMemcachedClientServerList
```

This was assigned CVE-2019-6980. The deserialization process happens at ImapMemcachedSerializer.deserialize() and triggers on ImapHandler.doSELECT() i.e. when a user invoking an IMAP SELECT command. The IMAP port in most cases is publicly accessible, so we can safely assume the trigger of this exploit.

To bring this to RCE, one still needs to find a suitable gadget to form a chain. The twist is, none of the current public chains (ysoserial) works on Zimbra.

### 1. Making of a gadget

Of all the gadgets available, [MozillaRhino1](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/MozillaRhino1.java) particularly stands out as all classes in the chain are available on Zimbra's classpath. This chain is based on Rhino library version 1.7R2. Zimbra uses the lib yuicompressor version 2.4.2 for js compression, and yuicompressor is bundled with Rhino 1.6R7. The unfortunate thing is there's an internal bug in 1.6R7 that would break the MozillaRhino1 chain before it ever reaches code execution, so we're out of luck. The good thing is, thanks to the effort in attempting to get the original chain to work and to the blog post detailing the MozillaRhino1 chain [[1]](#href1), we learnt a lot about Rhino's internals and on our way to pop another gadget.

There are two main points. First, the class NativeJavaObject on deserialization will store all members of an object's class. Members refer to all elements that define a class such as variables and methods. In Rhino context, it also detects when there's a getter or setter member and if so, it declares and includes the corresponding bean as an additonal member of this class. Second, a call to NativeJavaObject.get() will search those members for a matching bean name and if one is found, invoke that bean's getter. These match the nature of one of the native 'gadget helpers' - TemplatesImpl.getOutputProperties(). Essentially if we can pass in the name 'outputProperties' in NativeJavaObject.get(), Rhino will invoke TemplatesImpl.getOutputProperties() which will eventually lead to the construction of a malicious class from our predefined bytecodes. Searching for a place that we can control the passed-in member name leads to the discovery of JavaAdapter.getObjectFunctionNames() (Thanks to the valuable help from [@matthias\_kaiser](https://twitter.com/matthias_kaiser)) and it's directly accessible from NativeJavaObject.readObject().

The chain is now available in ysoserial's payload storage [under the name MozillaRhino2](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/MozillaRhino2.java). It works all the way to the latest version (with some tweaks) and has some additional improvement over MozillaRhino1. One interesting thing I found while reading Matt's blog post is that OpenJDK 1.7.x always bundles with rhino as its scripting engine, which essentially means that these rhino gadgets may very well work natively on OpenJDK7 and below.

This discovery escalates the bug from a Memcached Injection into a Code Execution. To exploit it, query into the Memcached service, pop out any 'zmImap' key, replace its value with the serialized object from ysoserial and next time the corresponding user logins via IMAP, the deserialization will trigger.

### 2. Smuggling from HTTP to Memcached

RCE from port 11211 sounds fun, but less so practical. So again, we turn to SSRF for help. The idea is to use the HTTP request from SSRF to inject our defined data in Memcached. To accomplish this, first we need to control a field in the HTTP request that allows the injection of newlines (CRLF). This is because a CRLF in Memcached will denote the end of a command and allow us to start a new arbitrary command after that. Second, since we're pushing raw objects into Memcached, our controlled input also needs to be able to carry binary data.

Zimbra has quite a few SSRFs in itself, however there's only one place that suffices both conditions, and it happens to be the all-powerful ProxyServlet earlier.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSgMR_-K4iXbEPdHRsOs3-DiKZX7oPyDSAOw-Ytqg55YejygdeyxNEt-HgUQuHFygCRHMtYZCqhlPoiuJK8t5ODsm1k_5RcgztRmAjWm6TvFCuIpFYx0dSpnllaOCokneFcj5UBgJc6pB6/s400/memcached_stored.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSgMR_-K4iXbEPdHRsOs3-DiKZX7oPyDSAOw-Ytqg55YejygdeyxNEt-HgUQuHFygCRHMtYZCqhlPoiuJK8t5ODsm1k_5RcgztRmAjWm6TvFCuIpFYx0dSpnllaOCokneFcj5UBgJc6pB6/s1600/memcached_stored.PNG)

For a successful smuggle from HTTP to Memcached protocol, you should see something like above under the hood. It has exactly 6 ERROR and 1 STORED, correlating to 6 lines of HTTP headers and our payload, which also means our payload was successfully injected.

### 3. RCE from public port

That said, things are different when we use SSRF to inject to Memcached. In this situation we could only inject data into the cache, not pop data out because HTTP protocol cannot parse Memcached response. So we have no idea what our targeted Memcached entry's key looks like, and we need to know the exact key to be able replace its value with our malicious payload.

Fortunately, the Memcached key for Zimbra Imap follows a structure that we can construct ourselves. It follows the pattern
```
zmImap:<accountId>:<folderNo>:<modseq>:<uidvalidity>
```
with:

- accountId fetched from hex-decoding any login token

- folderNo the constant '2' if we target the user's Inbox folder

- modseq and uidvalidity obtained via IMAP as shown below

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1eoib8WyLRtQSu8YR6YFO-ryxM9lpE-CJapIN6Kt9bc-sHXQO0KPGIGtRMlwcZRXtGWI370ZtIih7cHtGh6WQqypXSvtNxvPc93cpiNKRZkpHzKW0-M12joEekGo6AtoHFl2LpetXZDMD/s400/memcached_key_modseq.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1eoib8WyLRtQSu8YR6YFO-ryxM9lpE-CJapIN6Kt9bc-sHXQO0KPGIGtRMlwcZRXtGWI370ZtIih7cHtGh6WQqypXSvtNxvPc93cpiNKRZkpHzKW0-M12joEekGo6AtoHFl2LpetXZDMD/s1600/memcached_key_modseq.PNG)

Now we have everything we need. Putting it together, the chain would be as follows:

- Get a user credentials

- Construct a Memcached key for that user following the above instructions

- Generate a ysoserial payload from the gadget MozillaRhino2, use it as the Memcached entry value.

- Inject the payload to Memcached via the SSRF. In the end, our payload should look like:
```
"set zmImap:61e0594d-dda9-4274-87d8-a2912470a35e:2:162:1 2048 3600 <size_of_object>" + "\r\n" + <object> + "\r\n"
```
- Login again via IMAP. Upon selecting the Inbox folder, the payload will get deserialized, followed by the RCE gadget.

## The patches

Zimbra issued quite a number of patches, of which the most important are to fix XXEs and arbitrary deserialization. However the fix is only available for 8.7.11 and 8.8.x. If you happen to use an earlier version of Zimbra, consider upgrading to one of [their supported version](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases).

As a workaround, blocking public requests going to '/service/proxy\*' would most likely break the RCE chains. Unfortunately there's none that I can think of that could block all the XXEs without also breaking some of Zimbra features.

Edit 30/04: Including a more specific workaround for the Autodiscover XXE and ProxyServlet SSRF which seem to be actively exploited. Locate {zimbra\_home}/mailboxd/etc/service.web.xml.in, find the servlet tags named ProxyServlet and AutoDiscoverServlet, remove %%zimbraMailPort%% and %%zimbraMailSSLPort%% in both allowed.ports param and restart Zimbra. This would prevent public access to the affected components. Other than that, [this thread](https://forums.zimbra.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=65932) provides some useful information suggested by savvy Zimbra user on how to clean an infected instance.

   Hi! In my simulation environment, Zimbra's version is Zimbra 8.7.11\_GA\_1854. I tried to use the CVE-2018-20160 to trigger the XXE vulnerability, but it failed. The CVE-2018-20160 vulnerability can display content in an HTTP response, but I have tried it many times and found it to be unsuccessful. Do you know how to trigger the CVE-2018-20160 vulnerability?

   How does ssrf upload webshell through clientuploader? I tried it many times and it failed. Because ProxyServlet cookie will not be added to the request, may I ask how you do it?

     You don't need ssrf for it.

   Hi,

   Sorry for the ignorance and kudos for what it looks like a really outstanding job. For what I could understand, the use of imap is needed for doing some harm. Is not using imap service a good precaution to avoid the risk of being vulnerable? At least while we plan the timeframe for the update?

   Also, excecuting this "zmprov gs `zmhostname` zimbraMemcachedClientServerList" and getting nothing as return, does it means that we have not yet been attacked? Or only that we are not yet vulnerable?

   Thank you very much for your help!

   Thank you!

     Hi, sorry for the late reply. That command output does mean you are not vulnerable to the deserialization RCE, so blocking IMAP wouldn't make much sense.

   Imagine my surprise when I saw 5 random chars account with an admin one in one of my clients server. LOL, Wtf??
   Lucky for me, he left many prints through its journey into that server, and I noticed him.
   But he was able to upload a java web shell, wget some Bash stuff and tried to execute it to gain root access. Patched and cut him off just in time.
   However logs analysis (particularly XXE in Autodiscover.xml) brought me here.
   A very nice job. Work like this helps to build a better and more secure internet.
   Thanks

   Would be awesome to test that via a python script just to see if our environment is vulnerable. Didn't saw any PoC scripts yet :/

   Can we change the ownership of /jetty/webapps/zimbra to other system accounts and only allow zimbra for read and execute without write permission so that we can prevent hacker on uploading files

     You should do it on the /webapps directory, not just /zimbra

    When it comes to blocking '/service/proxy': I decided to block HTTP(S) completely and only allow access through an HTTP proxy with HTTP authentication. So, to use my webmail, I have to go to the proxy and enter a browser password first. I had to exlude some paths to make CalDAV and CardDAV work.

    See details here: https://forums.zimbra.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=65932&start=30#p289864.

      That seems to only add an additional layer of authentication and doesn't really block /service/proxy. For the workaround I'd block ProxyServlet from public access altogether. To do that, change the allowed.ports parameter to only 7070 in the servlet tag named ProxyServlet in {zimbra\_home}/mailboxd/etc/service.web.xml.in and restart the instance. You could also disable AutoDiscoverServlet there for the XXE.

      Is it mean to change the below line

      Yes. I also updated the blog post to include this workaround.

    Hi, I tried in my lab to use metasploit zimbra XXE module, with zimbra 8.6.0 1194 on centos7.
    The exploit can't upload java file, but can create the user.I want to try this vulnerability in my lab, Someone can give me some suggestion?

    I have checked that the mailbox server is not listening on port 7070 and only the admin port 7071. What is the meaning of 7070 port in the remaining configuration?
    How to total disable the autodiscover servlet?

    Hi,

    Thanks for the detailed announcement.

    We would like to know if Zimbra's MTA vulnerable? From what we can see on your blog post, HTTP+IMAP are vulnerable and mainly any service proxied by Zimbra' Nginx. We have an internal server where all the ports are restricted beside tcp port 25 in order to receive emails. The service that listens to this port is Postfix. Is there ANY chances we could have been vulnerable?

    Thanks!

      AFAIK Postfix has nothing to do with the other services so you should be fine.

    Thanks for the answer. How about LMTP ?

        This module exploits an XML external entity vulnerability and a
        server side request forgery to get unauthenticated code execution
        on Zimbra Collaboration Suite. The XML external entity vulnerability
        in the Autodiscover Servlet is used to read a Zimbra configuration
        file that contains an LDAP password for the 'zimbra' account. The
        zimbra credentials are then used to get a user authentication cookie
        with an AuthRequest message. Using the user cookie, a server side request
        forgery in the Proxy Servlet is used to proxy an AuthRequest with
        the 'zimbra' credentials to the admin port to retrieve an admin
        cookie. After gaining an admin cookie the Client Upload servlet is
        used to upload a JSP webshell that can be triggered from the web
        server to get command execution on the host. The issues reportedly
        affect Zimbra Collaboration Suite v8.5 to v8.7.11.

        This module was tested with Zimbra Release 8.7.1.GA.1670.UBUNTU16.64

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

#### ZCS 8.8.7 released

[ZCS 8.8.7](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.8.7) was released today. It includes fixes for a Persistent XSS vulnerability, [CVE-2018-6882](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-6882) / [bug 108768](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108786) and Mailsploit related issues / [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

Note: We recommend that all sites **upgrading** to 8.8.7 manually set **zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress** to **FALSE** which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.

 Mar 8, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZCS 8.6.0 Patch9 released

[ZCS 8.6.0 Patch 9](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.6.0_Patch9) was released today and includes fixes for two Persistent XSS vulnerabilities, [CVE-2017-8802](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-8802) / [bug 107925](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=107925) and [CVE-2017-17703](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17703) / [bug 108265](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108265).

If this patch is not applied, one potential workaround to avoid this issue is to set zimbraPrefUseKeyboardShortcuts to FALSE (for all users/classes-of-service). Note: disabling keyboard shortcuts would have the side effect of disabling all ZCS controlled keyboard shortcuts and this may impact normal user client interaction.

 Feb 9, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### ZWC affected by Mailsploit

All supported versions of Zimbra Web Client (ZWC) *prior to 8.8.7* are affected by [Mailsploit](https://www.mailsploit.com/). *We recommend that all sites upgrading to 8.8.7 manually set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE which is the default for new 8.8.7 installs.*

The workaround which addresses most issues is to set zimbraPrefShortEmailAddress to FALSE (if you are an administrator) for all users/classes-of-service. As an end user you can also control this setting by going to 'Preferences > Display names in place of email addresses when available' and deselecting the checkbox for this option (this is the end user control for the preference attribute mentioned above). This issue is being tracked as [bug 108709](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=108709).

Update 8.8.7 released:  Mar 8, 2018 -  **Phil Pearl**, Security Architect

#### Ransomware targeting ZCS Servers

[Lawrence Abrams](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/author/lawrence-abrams/) of [Bleeping Computer](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/) has [reported](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zimbra-ransomware-written-in-python-targets-zimbra-mail-store/) that there is a new [ransomware variant](https://gist.github.com/ratasxy/9416254d966bd701b5a85013969febaf), written in Python, that is targeting ZCS server data under **/opt/zimbra/store/**.

At this point, no details have been provided about how any servers were compromised. Without any details, the best advice we can give is:

* Get (and stay) up to date on OS version and patches.
* Get (and stay) up to date on [ZCS](https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/) version and patches.
* Ensure servers are properly firewalled (see [Ports](/wiki/Ports "Ports") and only allow access to the minimum number of services that is required to meet your business requirements.
* Review and compare your system configuration against best practices like the [CIS benchmarks](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/downloads/latest/).

#### Workaround: OpenSSL padding oracle in AES-NI CBC MAC check (CVE-2016-2107)

The [2016-05-03 announcement](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt) by [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) regarding a padding oracle in the AES-NI CBC MAC check affects [supported releases](https://www.zimbra.com/support/support-offerings/product-lifecycle/) of ZCS 8.0-8.6.0 (via MTAs and Proxy).

We anticipate releasing 8.6.1 (and 8.7) with fixes for this issue, however if this issue is impacting your environment, the recommended workaround is covered in [bug 104982](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=104982). NOTE: in ZCS 8.7+ we are able to easily patch third party packages included with ZCS via [package repos](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository).

First, test that you are vulnerable with the following tool:

<https://filippo.io/CVE-2016-2107/>

* Edit /opt/zimbra/.bash\_profile
  - add the following to the end of user zimbra's .bash\_profile (requires root privs):

  `# workaround CVE-2016-2107

  export OPENSSL_ia32cap="~0x200000200000000"`
* Edit sudoers - add the following line to your sudoers (/etc/sudoers or whatever is appropriate for your platform):

  `Defaults env_keep += "OPENSSL_ia32cap"`
* Configure postfix - instructs postfix to honor the desired environment variable:

  `$ zmlocalconfig -e postfix_import_environment='OPENSSL_ia32cap'`

A special thanks to Malte Stretz from our Gold Partner, [Silpion](http://www.silpion.de/), for his persistence and hard work to gather the information covered in this workaround! Also this article would be incomplete without mentioning that the original inspiration for this workaround came from <https://mjanja.ch/2013/11/disabling-aes-ni-on-linux-openssl/>.

#### A note on Logjam

There is a lot of chatter about [Logjam - https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/) today.

At this time, the initial impacts to Collab seem to be minimal and are currently limited to the MTA, specifically possible setting changes, depending upon your environment.

Today we updated the [MTA Ciphers](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86#Ciphers_4) section of our Collab 8.6 security wiki page. In short, for anyone concerned about the Logjam (cipher downgrade) style of MitM attacks, the use of 'export' and 'low' ciphers in Postfix should be avoided. Please note that Postfix, by default (<http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_ciphers>) allows use of lower ciphers. Changing these to 'medium' can reduce client interoperability and/or may cause some clients to fall back to in the clear communication channels instead of using lower grade encryption.

As usual, there are trade-offs involved, but in the light of FREAK ([https://freakattack.com](https://freakattack.com/)) and Logjam ([https://weakdh.org](https://weakdh.org/)) attacks, it may also be argued that using ciphers lower than 'medium' is now potentially providing an illusion of security. With this in mind, our current recommendation is to avoid both 'export' and 'low' ciphers with the hope that complete deprecation of these ciphers will be coming soon.

Please visit <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/86> to keep up with our latest recommendations. Also, for those looking to strengthen their security posture, in Collab 8.7 we have a number of enhancements slated including the ability to strengthen **[DH params](https://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=98852)**. A sneak preview of security related changes/enhancements in the works is available at <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security/Collab/87>.

Lastly, for those with openssl 1.0.2 available, you may find this post from OpenSSL useful <https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/05/20/logjam-freak-upcoming-changes/>

Update for 8.0.x customers: In Collab 8.0.x, Java 1.7 is used. Unfortunately, in Java 1.7, the DH parameters are hard-coded to 768 bits (excluding when using export cipher suites, which use 512 bits, but those should already be disabled). The workaround is to use the (Nginx) Proxy always. The other option is to disable all DHE suites. Which has the side effect of losing forward secrecy for any user agents that do not support ECDHE.

#### What the FREAK attack means to Zimbra

Zimbra is aware of a newly disclosed SSL/TLS vulnerability that provides a potential malicious actor with a method to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack the vulnerability is being referred to as FREAK (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), utilizing [CVE-2015-0204](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-0204).

The attack allows a malicious actor to force a downgrade of a secure connection to a vulnerable, export grade encryption (READ: weak encryption). Which, [according to Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/03/03/freak-flaw-undermines-security-for-apple-and-google-users-researchers-discover/), is downgraded to 512-bit encryption that was the maximum allowed under the export controls in place during the 1990s in the U.S. The Washington Post piece goes on to say it is possible to crack 512-bit encryption, today, in approximately 7 hours with the use of 75 computers, which can be rented from a cloud computing provider for approximately $100.

[Matthew Green](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/03/attack-of-week-freak-or-factoring-nsa.html), cryptographer and research professor from Johns Hopkins, provided a Cliffs Notes version:

A group of cryptographers at INRIA, Microsoft Research and IMDEA have discovered some serious vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (e.g., Android) clients and Apple TLS/SSL clients (e.g., Safari) that allow a 'man in the middle attacker' to downgrade connections from 'strong' RSA to 'export-grade' RSA. These attacks are real and exploitable against a shocking number of websites -- including government websites. Patch soon and be careful.

In addition to Matthew Green's post and the Washington Post article, the [freakattack.com](http://freakattack.com/) site has additional information, including a list of the top domains still vulnerable, as well as a built in check of the browser used to surf to the site.

#### Zimbra Specifics

Zimbra ships with the OpenSSL library. At this time, Zimbra has assessed Zimbra Collaboration 8.x, 7.x and found no susceptibility to the FREAK attack in the servers. As there is a client side component to this attack, please verify that you are running the latest browsers/clients to lower the risk to this type of attack.

As part of our security program, Zimbra will continue to monitor all developments related to the FREAK vulnerability and update this post as needed.

#### GNU C Library Vulnerability — aka GHOST

Zimbra is aware of a Linux vulnerability, specifically the GNU C Library.

**Details**

The vulnerability appears to have been found by [Qualys](https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability) and disclosed in security advisory [CVE 2015-0235](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0235). It should be noted that the vulnerability was patched in v 2.17 of the library, but at the time was not categorized as a security issue, leading many to maintain stable versions, i.e. vulnerable versions. This is an operating system vulnerability; at this time, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no known exploits against Zimbra's software related to CVE 2015-0235.

**\*\*Recommendation\*\***

Zimbra recommends that anyone running Linux update their systems as soon as possible. And while Linux doesn't usually require a restart, it is recommended to ensure all underlying software services are patched.

#### POODLE Revisited

We have received a few inquiries about the reported TLS protocol vulnerability via the POODLE attack. SSL/TLS services in ZCS come from OpenSSL and Java. This vulnerability does not affect OpenSSL (ref: [http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users@openssl.org/msg75804.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-users%40openssl.org/msg75804.html)) and Java is not known to be affected.

For anyone looking for more information, I recommend you look at <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html> by Adam Langley.

#### Security Advisory: Zimbra Community 8.x Security Vulnerability

Security is top of mind for everyone here at Zimbra, which is why we want to inform you that our team just discovered a security vulnerability in Zimbra Community 8.0 (formerly Telligent Community and Telligent Enterprise). The vulnerability is relegated to a very specific scenario in which a user within Zimbra Community 8.0 is able to view a user password via a specific API call.

**Summary:** The Zimbra development team has identified a very specific scenario where a user’s password in Community 8 is stored insecurely.

**Affected Versions:** 8.0.0.37997 (unpatched), 8.0.1.39116

**Vulnerability Scoring:** CVSS: 1.4

**Obtaining a fix:** <http://telligent.com/support/m/support/1354746.aspx>

**Details:** The administrative feature to create users leverages non-public APIs that can force a user’s password to be inadvertently stored insecurely.

**Reporter:** Alex Crome (Zimbra)

**When does this occur?**

1. Creating a user through the control panel using Membership Administration (requires administrative privileges)

2. Could occur if a custom plugin was deployed that copied off the extended attributes on a create user event and in turn re-saved those attributes using the UpdateUser API (this is unlikely, but possible)

If you have any questions or would like assistance with applying the patch, please contact support.

This advisory was originally [published here](http://blog.zimbra.com/blog/archives/2014/06/community-8-x-critical-security-vulnerability.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+zimbra+%28Zimbra+%3A%3A+Blog%29).

#### Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)

**20140606: Zimbra Security Advisory on CVE-2014-0224 (CCS Injection Vulnerability)**

On June 5, 2014 the OpenSSL project released a [security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt). [CVE-2014-0224](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0224) can allow for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to be carried out between a vulnerable client and vulnerable server. It is also important to note that Zimbra does not use DTLS nor do we have SSL\_MODE\_RELEASE\_BUFFERS enabled.

The impact to Zimbra Collaboration Server is as follows:

* ZCS 6 is not affected
* ZCS 7 is not affected
* ZCS 8 is affected

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable.

If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>). Please upgrade to a newer version first, then run this patch.

Zimbra has produced a patch for OpenSSL vulnerabily for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

The following patch instructions must be done on a per server basis:

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol stop

```

* As root:

```
cd /tmp
wget http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh
chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
./zmopenssl-updater.sh

```

* As zimbra user:

```
zmcontrol start

```

After a successful patch, ZCS 8.0.7 will be running 1.0.1h. To verify this, run the following as zimbra user:

```
openssl version

```

On an 8.0.7 patched system the result should be:

```
zimbra$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.0.1h 5 Jun 2014

```

Earlier versions of ZCS will show other versions of OpenSSL - Zimbra patches the existing OpenSSL version appropriate to each ZCS version.

Continue to the next server and repeat the patch process.

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries. It only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra.

#### Critical Security Advisory and Builds/Patches for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability

**Overview**

Zimbra Collaboration Server 8 is susceptible to the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug:

* <http://heartbleed.com>
* <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt>
* <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160>

Specifically, nginx, postfix and OpenLDAP all link directly to OpenSSL shipped in ZCS8. Other components in the ZCS package also link to the openssl libraries, but the above three are the potentially Internet-facing services that would be attackable. All versions of ZCS8 as released today are vulnerable. ZCS7 is not vulnerable because it uses OpenSSL 1.0.0, which is not vulnerable. Only OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later are reported as being vulnerable.

Zimbra has produced an OpenSSL patch for versions 8.0.3 to 8.0.7. If you are running a version prior to 8.0.3, your server is susceptible to other critical security vulnerabilities (reference: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/68752-urgency-security-fixes-bug-80338-bug-84547-a.html>), so you would please need to upgrade to a secure version first, then run this patch.

The patch is located here:

* <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>

The patch downloads the correct and patched version of OpenSSL for the following versions and then installs the new package:

* ZCS versions 8.0.3, 8.0.4, 8.0.5, 8.0.6, or 8.0.7
* ZCA versions 8.0.3 or 8.0.4

Internet access from each node is required to run this patch automatically. The patch should be installed on all ZCS nodes, most importantly the proxies, MTAs and LDAP nodes.

Please note: this vulnerability is being reported as having existed and actively attacked since 2012. As such, the private SSL keys for your platform may already have been compromised. After patching, it is recommended to regenerate your SSL certificates and private keys. This is unfortunate, but the only way to ensure that an attacker cannot decrypt your SSL session data.

Also, please note: if you upgrade to a GA release after patching, you would need to re-patch. For example, if you install this patch on ZCS 8.0.6, then upgrade to ZCS 8.0.7, you would need to re-patch against 8.0.7.

Finally, please note that the various Operating Systems are also vulnerable to this issue if running OpenSSL 1.0.1. The Zimbra patch will not update OS-level openssl libraries - it only updates the openssl package in /opt/zimbra. For example:

* RHEL6\_64 and UBUNTU12\_64 both use OpenSSL 1.0.1 at the OS level and are affected
* SLES11\_64 and UBUNTU10\_64 use OpenSSL 0.9.8 at the OS level, so are not affected

### Patching

The steps to patch are the following:

(as root)
1) wget <http://files.zimbra.com/downloads/security/zmopenssl-updater.sh>
2) chmod a+rx zmopenssl-updater.sh
3) ./zmopenssl-updater.sh

### Zimbra Collaboration 8.0.7 Builds

Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.0.7 - both the Network Edition and Open-Source Edition - have been rebuilt to include the fix for the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability.

If you haven't yet upgraded to 8.0.7, the current versions up on the Download site now disable TLS Heartbeat and protect against the OpenSSL Heartbleed Vulnerability:

* Network Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-network.html>
* Open-Source Edition: <http://www.zimbra.com/products/download-opensource.html>

In short:

* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 prior to Thursday, April 10, then your version DOES NOT include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6020 -> **Vulnerable, you would still need the OpenSSL patch**: <https://www.zimbra.com/forums/announcements/70921-critical-security-advisory-patch-openssl-heartbleed-vulnerability.html>
* If you downloaded ZCS 8.0.7 Thursday, April 10 or after, then your version DOES include the OpenSSL fix. This would be ZCS 8.0.7 build 6021 -> **Not Vulnerable, no patch required**

### OpenSSL Patch Update for ZCS 8.0.3 Only

If you patched for the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability for Zimbra Collaboration Server 8.0.3 prior to Wed April 09, 2014, 11:00 Eastern/08:00 Pacific, you will need to re-patch.

Please note: this is ONLY for ZCS 8.0.3. All other patches were fine, but the 8.0.3 openssl builds were still vulnerable. Repeating, this is only for ZCS 8.0.3.

Here is how you can check your build version:
$ zmcontrol -v
(look for "8.0.3")

Please use the test methods below to confirm.

### Testing

There are a few ways you can confirm if your system is vulnerable:

1. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check your version tarball for the build number 6021. For example:

* [http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7\_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64.20140408123937.tgz](http://files2.zimbra.com/downloads/8.0.7_GA/zcs-NETWORK-8.0.7_GA_6021.RHEL6_64.20140408123937.tgz) - the build number here is "6021"

2. If running ZCS 8.0.7, check zmcontrol for the build number:

# su - zimbra
$ zmcontrol -v
Release 8.0.7\_GA\_**6021**.RHEL6\_64\_20140408123937 RHEL6\_64 NETWORK edition.

3. If running any version of Zimbra Collaboration, check if the libssl shared library is built with dlts1\_heartbeat:

**Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
dtls1\_heartbeat
$

**Not Vulnerable:**
$ strings /opt/zimbra/openssl/lib/libssl.so | grep dtls1\_heartbeat
$

Please let Zimbra know promptly if any problems or questions.

# What's New

**NOTE:** Beta features should not be installed and are not supported on production systems. Beta modules have been provided for evaluation in lab environments only.

| **Zimbra Collaboration Suite:**  * **Hierarchical Address Book** (Stable) - An Hierarchical Address Book (HAB) is an enhancement of the Global Address List (GAL) that includes organization information, enabling contact selection by sub-organization and seniority. The Zimbra Web Client now gives users the ability to view, navigate and select contacts from the HAB. With HAB enabled, "Global Organization" appears as a contact source in the Select-Addresses dialog, and selecting it changes the dialog to facilitate navigating the organization as a tree structure. * Automatic configuration for platform Calendar, Contact and Email apps on iOS and MacOS is now supported by direct download of mobileconfig files. Users will find Mobile Configuration in Preferences - Connected Devices & Apps. * **Ubuntu 18.04 support** (Beta) |
| --- |
| **Zimbra Connector for Outlook:**  * Recover Deleted Items: ZCO now supports Zimbra's Dumpster feature. Messages and Contacts that have been permanently deleted can be recovered back to the user's Trash folder. This requires that the feature be enabled for the user (zimbraDumpsterEnabled). Currently this feature is available in English only; localization will be provided in an upcoming patch. * Added an option for a *Simplified Support View* when producing a custom MSI. This simplifies the Support tab in ZCO with a limited menu of actions. * Actions for the Persona feature will now only be shown if the feature is enabled for the user. |
| **Zimbra Drive:**  * Zimbra Drive is declared Stable as of this release. If you had deployed with Beta, please refer to [Known Issues](#known). * When sharing a file in Drive, an email can be automatically sent to collaborators. * Users can now download entire folders from Drive via a new Download option on folder menus and context menus. * **Reminder:** Legacy Zimbra Drive based on Nextcloud / Owncloud integration has been renamed Open Drive, and is compatible with:   + [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/changelog) versions 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 only (See NextCloud store for latest.)   + [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/) versions 9.0, 9.1, and 10 only |
| **Zimbra Talk:**  * **Instant meeting** adds the ability to initiate a video call including external users. |
| **Zimbra Docs:**  * Zimbra Docs server build is now based on latest version of LOOL 4.0.1. "This release includes a fresh look - with improved toolbar colors and layout, ...easier shape editing, as well as improved interoperability provided by upgrading the underlying document rendering core to Collabora Office 6.0." |
| **NG Backup:**  * **Blobless Backup** (Beta) gives administrators the option to skip blobs during backup, thereby reducing the elapsed time required to perform the backup. For system integrity, blob backup should be provided through some other mechanism. |

| Fixed Issues | |
| --- | --- |
| **Area** | **Description** |
| Mail | A fix in 8.8.11 that prevented unwanted duplication of attachments came with a side-effect bug that suppressed the display of inline PDF attachments sent from Apple Mail clients. This has been fixed. |
| Calendar | The Quick Add or New Event dialog always pre-selects the user's *Default Calendar* from preferences when creating a new event. This occurs even when the user is viewing only one of their available calendars; in that case the expected behavior should be to pre-select that calendar, not the user's default. |
| ZCO | GAL synchronization message now properly reports progress expressed as progress / total items. |
| ZCO | The Add Share button is hidden for ZCO users who do not have Sharing enabled (i.e. zimbraFeatureSharingEnabled is false). |
| NG Mobile | Hidden folders and their contents are skipped during synchronization. Previously, such folders caused synchronization to fail. |
| NG Backup | Missing Blob errors will only be logged once, mitigating a problem that caused mailbox.log to grow exponentially and stop smartscan from completing. |
| Zimbra Docs | Documents shared in Read-Only mode can now be edited only from the authenticated owner's account. |
| Zimbra Drive | Files contained in Drive will now remain accessible in ReadOnly mode if the license expires. |
| Zimbra Drive | On multiserver, downloading a drive folder as zip would sometimes result in a corrupted zip file. This has been fixed. |
| Zimbra Drive | Fixed a bug that blocked the viewing or editing of share information when a file or folder was shared with a distribution list. |
| Zimbra Drive | After user's computer resumed from "sleep", Zimbra Drive would often show errors *The server is off-line* or *I'm thinking*. Now when the websocket connection has been closed, the client tries to reopen it at increasing time intervals, to ensure Drive reconnects. |
| Zimbra Talk | After a video call ended, the webcam may have remained active. The video stream is now reliably terminated when the call ends. Workaround for earlier versions is to refresh the browser if the webcam activity LED remained on past the end of call. |

| Known Issues | |
| --- | --- |
| **Area** | **Description** |
| Zimbra Drive | Documents stored in briefcase or Zimbra Drive that have very long names are opened in view-only mode. To work around this, shorten the filename on the document. |
| Web UX | Hierarchical Address Book (HAB) is supported in English only. Support for additional languages will be provided in an upcoming patch release. |
| Zimbra Drive | If you used Zimbra Drive v2 (Beta) prior to its Stable release, we advise you to clean up the Beta database before proceeding. Refer to [How to Clean up a Zimbra Drive (Beta) Database](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/index.php?curid=23831). |
| ZCO | Dumpster feature is supported in English only. Support for additional languages will be provided in an upcoming patch release. |
| ZCO | Older versions of the Outlook Connector for Zimbra (prior to Version 8.8.10) do not detect versions 8.8.10 and higher, so users will receive no notification that an upgrade is available. End users are recommended to initiate a manual upgrade to this version of the connector. |
| Zextras | When attempting to install Zimbra Suite Plus (ZSP) on an incompatible version of ZCS, the admin will receive an error message with the incorrect URL for the Compatibility List. The correct URL is <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Suite_Plus/Compatibility_List>. |
| Platform | After an upgrade to 8.8.12, IMAP users are unable to access folders with names containing non-ASCII characters. This is fixed in 8.8.12 P1. |

| Product Lifecycle Updates |
| --- |
| **IMAPD** was released as Beta with [Zimbra 8.8.5](/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.8 "Zimbra Releases/8.8"), and has not been released as Stable. It has been deprecated. |
| **ZCS Migration Wizard for Exchange** is supported only for PST file import, with End of Technical Guidance set for 31 December 2020. We recommend [audriga's self-service migration solution](https://zimbra.audriga.com) as a preferred alternative for all account migrations. |
| **ZCS Migration Wizard for Domino** is now deprecated. |
| **ZCS Account Migration** within the Zimbra Admin UI is no longer supported, with End of Technical Guidance set for 17 December 2019. |
| **Zimbra Classic HSM, Classic Backup,** and **Classic Mobile** are deprecated and will be removed in the next release of Zimbra 8.8. Installations that have not yet migrated to new Network Edition NG Modules or ZSP are encouraged to do so. |
| **Zimbra Desktop** is no longer supported, with End of Technical Guidance set for 1 October 2019. |
| **Zimbra Touch Client** is now deprecated. |
| **Zimbra Mobile Client** is now deprecated. |
| **HTML Client** is no longer supported, with End of Technical Guidance set for 1 July 2022. |

# [REPOST] Recent Zimbra XXE / SSRF Vulnerability Disclosure

By [Rene Otto](https://blog.zimbra.com/author/rene-otto/ "Posts by Rene Otto") on May 16, 2019 in [Product News](https://blog.zimbra.com/product-news/ "View all items in Product News"), [Product Updates](https://blog.zimbra.com/product-updates/ "View all items in Product Updates"), [Security & Privacy](https://blog.zimbra.com/security-privacy/ "View all items in Security & Privacy")

**This is a reposting of Rene’s original blog announcement on March 18, 2019. Please read and be sure that your Zimbra Patches are up-to-date!**

Hello Zimbra Friends,

**Background**

The Zimbra Security team has been working with security researcher An Trinh in advance of his recently-published [blog post.](https://blog.tint0.com/2019/03/a-saga-of-code-executions-on-zimbra.html) In the blog, Trinh details his findings regarding a vulnerability which, if exploited, could allow an attacker to remotely execute code on an affected Zimbra system.

**To secure supported versions of Zimbra (8.7 and 8.8)**

* Zimbra customers running versions of 8.8 must upgrade to 8.8.10 Patch 7 or 8.8.11 Patch 3
* Zimbra customers running the long term support version (LTS) 8.7.11 must upgrade to 8.7.11 Patch 10

**To secure unsupported version of Zimbra (8.6 and earlier)**

* Customers running 8.6 must upgrade to Patch 13 – This Patch is scheduled for release 19 March.
* Older versions of Zimbra are vulnerable until they are upgraded to a supported version.

If you require guidance around your upgrade, please contact your Zimbra Partner or [Zimbra Support](https://support.zimbra.com/) for further information.

***NOTE: Zimbra recommends that you always upgrade to the latest version of Zimbra to protect against possible security vulnerabilities.***

Many thanks,

Rene Otto

Vice President Product eMail and Collaboration

     Hi SN – the response from Zimbra Support is:

     You need to upgrade from 8.7.10 to 8.7.11 and install patch 11. Doing a system upgrade will take down the system, but you can limit the downtime by doing a rolling upgrade. <https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Rolling_Upgrades_Overview>

     Thanks

### A Saga of Code Executions on Zimbra

Zimbra is well known for its signature email product, Zimbra Collaboration Suite. Putting client-side vulnerabilities aside, Zimbra seems to have very little [security history](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Security_Advisories) in the past. Its last critical bug was a Local File Disclosure back in 2013.

Recently with several new findings, it has been known that at least one potential Remote Code Execution exists in all versions of Zimbra. Specifically,

- Pre-Auth RCE on Zimbra <8.5.

- Pre-Auth RCE on Zimbra from 8.5 to 8.7.11.

- Auth'd RCE on Zimbra 8.8.11 and below with an additional condition that Zimbra uses Memcached. More on that in [the next section](#memcached_condition).

## Breaking Zimbra part 1

### 1. The XXE cavalry - CVE-2016-9924, CVE-2018-20160, CVE-2019-9670

Zimbra uses a large amount of XML handling for both its internal and external operations. With great XML usage comes great XXE vulnerabilities.

Back in 2016, another researcher discovered CVE-2016-9924 with the bug locating in SoapEngine.chooseFaultProtocolFromBadXml(), which happens on the parsing of invalid XML requests. This code is used in all Zimbra instances version below 8.5. Note however, as there's no way to extract the output to the HTTP response, an out-of-band extraction method is required in exploiting it.

For more recent versions, CVE-2019-9670 works flawlessly where the XXE lies in the handling of Autodiscover requests. This can be applied on Zimbra from 8.5 to 8.7.11. And for the sake of completeness, CVE-2018-20160 is an XXE in the handling of XMPP protocol and an additional bug along CVE-2019-9670 is a prevention bypass in the sanitizing of XHTML documents which also leads to XXE, however they both require some additional conditions to trigger. These all allow direct file extraction through response.

It's worth to mention that exploiting out-of-band XXE on recent Java just got a lot harder due to a patch in the core FtpClient which makes it reject all FTP commands containing newline. This doesn't affect the exploits for the vulnerabilities mentioned above, but it did make some of my previous efforts to chain XXE with other bugs in vain.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4PeI0Ciy1c8D0i2lv_KbKHNuAMMMwv78ccEqLtePUjpOd-K8cZUmL93gxI9i9hizueATB1nHkM16JH_Vopn13z5SaNKJzQEtQsUG0vK2fSZzKKyGHiZkC0mcHNN77TbPKrN9kk1Sqr8gX/s400/ftp_patch.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4PeI0Ciy1c8D0i2lv_KbKHNuAMMMwv78ccEqLtePUjpOd-K8cZUmL93gxI9i9hizueATB1nHkM16JH_Vopn13z5SaNKJzQEtQsUG0vK2fSZzKKyGHiZkC0mcHNN77TbPKrN9kk1Sqr8gX/s1600/ftp_patch.PNG)
*sun.net.ftp.impl.FtpClient*

On installation, Zimbra sets up a global admin for its internal SOAP communications, with the username 'zimbra' and a randomly generated password. These information are always stored in a local file named localconfig.xml. As such, a file-read vulnerability like XXE could potentially be catastrophic to Zimbra, since it allows an attacker to acquire the login information of a user with all the admin rights. This has been demonstrated as the case in a [CVE-2013-7091 LFI exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/30472) where under certain conditions, one could use such credentials to gain RCE.

However things have never been that easy. Zimbra manages user privileges via tokens, and it sets up an application model such that an admin token can only be granted to requests coming to the admin port, which by default is 7071. The aforementioned LFI exploit conveniently assumes we already have access to that port. But how often do you see the weirdo 7071 open to public?

### 2. SSRF to the rescue - CVE-2019-9621

If you can't access the port from public, let the application do it for you. The code at ProxyServlet.doProxy() does exactly what its name says, it proxies a request to another designated location. What's more, this servlet is available on the normal webapp and therefore accessible from public. Sweet! However the code has an additional protection, it checks whether the proxied target matches a set of predefined whitelisted domains. That is, unless the request is from an admin. Sounds right, an admin should be able to do what he wants.

(Un)Fortunately, the admin checks are flawed. First thing it checks is whether the request comes from port 7071. However it uses [ServletRequest.getServerPort()](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html#getServerPort()) to fetch the incoming port. This method returns a tainted input controllable by an attacker, which is the part after ':' in the Host header. What's more, after that the check for the admin token happens only if it is fetched from a parameter, meanwhile we can totally send a token via cookie! In short, if we send a request with 'foo:7071' Host header and a valid token in cookie, we can proxy a request to arbitrary targets that is otherwise only accessible to admins.

### 3. Pre-Auth RCE from public port

ProxyServlet still needs a valid token though, so how does this fit in a preauth RCE chain? Turns out Zimbra has a 'hidden' feature that can help us generate a normal user token under the special global 'zimbra' account. When we modify an ordinary SOAP AuthRequest which looks like this:
```
...<account by="name">an</account>...
```
into this:
```
...<account by="adminName">zimbra</account>...
```
Zimbra will then lookup all the admin accounts and proceed to check the password. This is actually quite surprising because Zimbra admins and users naturally reside in two different LDAP branches. A normal AuthRequest should only touch the normal user branch, never the other. If the application wants a token for an admin, it already has port 7071 for that.

Note that while this little trick could give us a token for the 'zimbra' user, this token doesn't have any of the admin flag in it as it's not coming from port 7071. This is when ProxyServlet jumps in, which will help us to proxy another admin AuthRequest to port 7071 and obtain a global admin token.

Now that we've got everything we need. The flow is to read the config file via XXE, generate a low-priv token through a normal AuthRequest, proxy an admin AuthRequest to the local admin port via ProxyServlet and finally, use the global admin token to upload a webshell via the ClientUploader extension.

## Breaking Zimbra part 2

Zimbra has its own implementation of IMAP protocol, where it keeps a cache of the recently logged-in mailbox folders so that it doesn't have to load all the metadata from scratch next time. Zimbra serializes a user's mailbox folders to the cache on logging out and deserializes it when the same user logs in again.

It has three ways to maintain a cache: Memcached(network-based input), EhCache(memory-based) and file-based. If one fails, it tries the next in list. Of all of those, we can only hope to manipulate Memcached, and this is the condition of the exploit: Zimbra has to use Memcached as its caching mechanism. Even though Memcached is prioritized over the others, (un)fortunately on a single-server instance, the LDAP key zimbraMemcachedClientServerList isn't auto-populated, so Zimbra wouldn't know where the service is and will fail over to Ehcache. This is probably a bug in Zimbra itself, as Memcached service is up and running by default and that way it wouldn't have any data in it. On a multi-server install however, setting this key is expected as only Memcached can work accross many servers.

To check whether your Zimbra install is vulnerable, invoke this command on *every* node in the cluster and check if it returns a value:
```
$ zmprov gs `zmhostname` zimbraMemcachedClientServerList
```

This was assigned CVE-2019-6980. The deserialization process happens at ImapMemcachedSerializer.deserialize() and triggers on ImapHandler.doSELECT() i.e. when a user invoking an IMAP SELECT command. The IMAP port in most cases is publicly accessible, so we can safely assume the trigger of this exploit.

To bring this to RCE, one still needs to find a suitable gadget to form a chain. The twist is, none of the current public chains (ysoserial) works on Zimbra.

### 1. Making of a gadget

Of all the gadgets available, [MozillaRhino1](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/MozillaRhino1.java) particularly stands out as all classes in the chain are available on Zimbra's classpath. This chain is based on Rhino library version 1.7R2. Zimbra uses the lib yuicompressor version 2.4.2 for js compression, and yuicompressor is bundled with Rhino 1.6R7. The unfortunate thing is there's an internal bug in 1.6R7 that would break the MozillaRhino1 chain before it ever reaches code execution, so we're out of luck. The good thing is, thanks to the effort in attempting to get the original chain to work and to the blog post detailing the MozillaRhino1 chain [[1]](#href1), we learnt a lot about Rhino's internals and on our way to pop another gadget.

There are two main points. First, the class NativeJavaObject on deserialization will store all members of an object's class. Members refer to all elements that define a class such as variables and methods. In Rhino context, it also detects when there's a getter or setter member and if so, it declares and includes the corresponding bean as an additonal member of this class. Second, a call to NativeJavaObject.get() will search those members for a matching bean name and if one is found, invoke that bean's getter. These match the nature of one of the native 'gadget helpers' - TemplatesImpl.getOutputProperties(). Essentially if we can pass in the name 'outputProperties' in NativeJavaObject.get(), Rhino will invoke TemplatesImpl.getOutputProperties() which will eventually lead to the construction of a malicious class from our predefined bytecodes. Searching for a place that we can control the passed-in member name leads to the discovery of JavaAdapter.getObjectFunctionNames() (Thanks to the valuable help from [@matthias\_kaiser](https://twitter.com/matthias_kaiser)) and it's directly accessible from NativeJavaObject.readObject().

The chain is now available in ysoserial's payload storage [under the name MozillaRhino2](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/blob/master/src/main/java/ysoserial/payloads/MozillaRhino2.java). It works all the way to the latest version (with some tweaks) and has some additional improvement over MozillaRhino1. One interesting thing I found while reading Matt's blog post is that OpenJDK 1.7.x always bundles with rhino as its scripting engine, which essentially means that these rhino gadgets may very well work natively on OpenJDK7 and below.

This discovery escalates the bug from a Memcached Injection into a Code Execution. To exploit it, query into the Memcached service, pop out any 'zmImap' key, replace its value with the serialized object from ysoserial and next time the corresponding user logins via IMAP, the deserialization will trigger.

### 2. Smuggling from HTTP to Memcached

RCE from port 11211 sounds fun, but less so practical. So again, we turn to SSRF for help. The idea is to use the HTTP request from SSRF to inject our defined data in Memcached. To accomplish this, first we need to control a field in the HTTP request that allows the injection of newlines (CRLF). This is because a CRLF in Memcached will denote the end of a command and allow us to start a new arbitrary command after that. Second, since we're pushing raw objects into Memcached, our controlled input also needs to be able to carry binary data.

Zimbra has quite a few SSRFs in itself, however there's only one place that suffices both conditions, and it happens to be the all-powerful ProxyServlet earlier.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSgMR_-K4iXbEPdHRsOs3-DiKZX7oPyDSAOw-Ytqg55YejygdeyxNEt-HgUQuHFygCRHMtYZCqhlPoiuJK8t5ODsm1k_5RcgztRmAjWm6TvFCuIpFYx0dSpnllaOCokneFcj5UBgJc6pB6/s400/memcached_stored.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSgMR_-K4iXbEPdHRsOs3-DiKZX7oPyDSAOw-Ytqg55YejygdeyxNEt-HgUQuHFygCRHMtYZCqhlPoiuJK8t5ODsm1k_5RcgztRmAjWm6TvFCuIpFYx0dSpnllaOCokneFcj5UBgJc6pB6/s1600/memcached_stored.PNG)

For a successful smuggle from HTTP to Memcached protocol, you should see something like above under the hood. It has exactly 6 ERROR and 1 STORED, correlating to 6 lines of HTTP headers and our payload, which also means our payload was successfully injected.

### 3. RCE from public port

That said, things are different when we use SSRF to inject to Memcached. In this situation we could only inject data into the cache, not pop data out because HTTP protocol cannot parse Memcached response. So we have no idea what our targeted Memcached entry's key looks like, and we need to know the exact key to be able replace its value with our malicious payload.

Fortunately, the Memcached key for Zimbra Imap follows a structure that we can construct ourselves. It follows the pattern
```
zmImap:<accountId>:<folderNo>:<modseq>:<uidvalidity>
```
with:

- accountId fetched from hex-decoding any login token

- folderNo the constant '2' if we target the user's Inbox folder

- modseq and uidvalidity obtained via IMAP as shown below

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1eoib8WyLRtQSu8YR6YFO-ryxM9lpE-CJapIN6Kt9bc-sHXQO0KPGIGtRMlwcZRXtGWI370ZtIih7cHtGh6WQqypXSvtNxvPc93cpiNKRZkpHzKW0-M12joEekGo6AtoHFl2LpetXZDMD/s400/memcached_key_modseq.PNG)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1eoib8WyLRtQSu8YR6YFO-ryxM9lpE-CJapIN6Kt9bc-sHXQO0KPGIGtRMlwcZRXtGWI370ZtIih7cHtGh6WQqypXSvtNxvPc93cpiNKRZkpHzKW0-M12joEekGo6AtoHFl2LpetXZDMD/s1600/memcached_key_modseq.PNG)

Now we have everything we need. Putting it together, the chain would be as follows:

- Get a user credentials

- Construct a Memcached key for that user following the above instructions

- Generate a ysoserial payload from the gadget MozillaRhino2, use it as the Memcached entry value.

- Inject the payload to Memcached via the SSRF. In the end, our payload should look like:
```
"set zmImap:61e0594d-dda9-4274-87d8-a2912470a35e:2:162:1 2048 3600 <size_of_object>" + "\r\n" + <object> + "\r\n"
```
- Login again via IMAP. Upon selecting the Inbox folder, the payload will get deserialized, followed by the RCE gadget.

## The patches

Zimbra issued quite a number of patches, of which the most important are to fix XXEs and arbitrary deserialization. However the fix is only available for 8.7.11 and 8.8.x. If you happen to use an earlier version of Zimbra, consider upgrading to one of [their supported version](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases).

As a workaround, blocking public requests going to '/service/proxy\*' would most likely break the RCE chains. Unfortunately there's none that I can think of that could block all the XXEs without also breaking some of Zimbra features.

Edit 30/04: Including a more specific workaround for the Autodiscover XXE and ProxyServlet SSRF which seem to be actively exploited. Locate {zimbra\_home}/mailboxd/etc/service.web.xml.in, find the servlet tags named ProxyServlet and AutoDiscoverServlet, remove %%zimbraMailPort%% and %%zimbraMailSSLPort%% in both allowed.ports param and restart Zimbra. This would prevent public access to the affected components. Other than that, [this thread](https://forums.zimbra.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=65932) provides some useful information suggested by savvy Zimbra user on how to clean an infected instance.

   Hi! In my simulation environment, Zimbra's version is Zimbra 8.7.11\_GA\_1854. I tried to use the CVE-2018-20160 to trigger the XXE vulnerability, but it failed. The CVE-2018-20160 vulnerability can display content in an HTTP response, but I have tried it many times and found it to be unsuccessful. Do you know how to trigger the CVE-2018-20160 vulnerability?

   How does ssrf upload webshell through clientuploader? I tried it many times and it failed. Because ProxyServlet cookie will not be added to the request, may I ask how you do it?

     You don't need ssrf for it.

   Hi,

   Sorry for the ignorance and kudos for what it looks like a really outstanding job. For what I could understand, the use of imap is needed for doing some harm. Is not using imap service a good precaution to avoid the risk of being vulnerable? At least while we plan the timeframe for the update?

   Also, excecuting this "zmprov gs `zmhostname` zimbraMemcachedClientServerList" and getting nothing as return, does it means that we have not yet been attacked? Or only that we are not yet vulnerable?

   Thank you very much for your help!

   Thank you!

     Hi, sorry for the late reply. That command output does mean you are not vulnerable to the deserialization RCE, so blocking IMAP wouldn't make much sense.

   Imagine my surprise when I saw 5 random chars account with an admin one in one of my clients server. LOL, Wtf??
   Lucky for me, he left many prints through its journey into that server, and I noticed him.
   But he was able to upload a java web shell, wget some Bash stuff and tried to execute it to gain root access. Patched and cut him off just in time.
   However logs analysis (particularly XXE in Autodiscover.xml) brought me here.
   A very nice job. Work like this helps to build a better and more secure internet.
   Thanks

   Would be awesome to test that via a python script just to see if our environment is vulnerable. Didn't saw any PoC scripts yet :/

     You should do it on the /webapps directory, not just /zimbra

    When it comes to blocking '/service/proxy': I decided to block HTTP(S) completely and only allow access through an HTTP proxy with HTTP authentication. So, to use my webmail, I have to go to the proxy and enter a browser password first. I had to exlude some paths to make CalDAV and CardDAV work.

    See details here: https://forums.zimbra.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=65932&start=30#p289864.

      That seems to only add an additional layer of authentication and doesn't really block /service/proxy. For the workaround I'd block ProxyServlet from public access altogether. To do that, change the allowed.ports parameter to only 7070 in the servlet tag named ProxyServlet in {zimbra\_home}/mailboxd/etc/service.web.xml.in and restart the instance. You could also disable AutoDiscoverServlet there for the XXE.

    The exploit can't upload java file, but can create the user.I want to try this vulnerability in my lab, Someone can give me some suggestion?

    I have checked that the mailbox server is not listening on port 7070 and only the admin port 7071. What is the meaning of 7070 port in the remaining configuration?
    How to total disable the autodiscover servlet?

    Hi,

    Thanks for the detailed announcement.

    We would like to know if Zimbra's MTA vulnerable? From what we can see on your blog post, HTTP+IMAP are vulnerable and mainly any service proxied by Zimbra' Nginx. We have an internal server where all the ports are restricted beside tcp port 25 in order to receive emails. The service that listens to this port is Postfix. Is there ANY chances we could have been vulnerable?

    Thanks!

      AFAIK Postfix has nothing to do with the other services so you should be fine.

### Zimbra Collaboration Autodiscover Servlet XXE and ProxyServlet SSRF

Disclosed
03/13/2019

Created
04/22/2019

#### Description

This module exploits an XML external entity vulnerability and a
server side request forgery to get unauthenticated code execution
on Zimbra Collaboration Suite. The XML external entity vulnerability
in the Autodiscover Servlet is used to read a Zimbra configuration
file that contains an LDAP password for the 'zimbra' account. The
zimbra credentials are then used to get a user authentication cookie
with an AuthRequest message. Using the user cookie, a server side request
forgery in the Proxy Servlet is used to proxy an AuthRequest with
the 'zimbra' credentials to the admin port to retrieve an admin
cookie. After gaining an admin cookie the Client Upload servlet is
used to upload a JSP webshell that can be triggered from the web
server to get command execution on the host. The issues reportedly
affect Zimbra Collaboration Suite v8.5 to v8.7.11.
This module was tested with Zimbra Release 8.7.1.GA.1670.UBUNTU16.64
UBUNTU16\_64 FOSS edition.

#### Author(s)

* An Trinh
* Khanh Viet Pham
* Jacob Robles

#### Platform

Linux

#### Architectures

java

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/linux/http/zimbra_xxe_rce
msf exploit(zimbra_xxe_rce) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(zimbra_xxe_rce) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(zimbra_xxe_rce) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(zimbra_xxe_rce) > exploit
```

### Metasploit

Penetration testing software for offensive security teams.

Key Features

* [Simulate complex attacks against your systems and users](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Test your defenses to make sure they’re ready](/products/metasploit/features)
* [Automate Every Step of Your Penetration Test](/products/metasploit/features)

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

# Patch Installation

## Before Installing the Patch

Before installing the patch, consider the following:

* Patches are cumulative.
* A full backup should be performed before any patch is applied. There is no automated roll-back.
* Zimlet patches can include removing existing Zimlets and redeploying the patched Zimlet.
* Only files or Zimlets associated with installed packages will be installed from the patch.
* Switch to user **zimbra** before using ZCS CLI commands.
* **Important!** You cannot revert to the previous ZCS release after you upgrade to the patch.
* **Important Note for ZCS Setup with Local ZCS repository:** Customers who have setup local ZCS repository should first update the local repository by following instructions in [wiki](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Collaboration_repository#Keep_the_local_Repository_up_to_date)
