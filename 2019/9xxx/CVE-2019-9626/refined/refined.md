Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and escaping in the `pintuan_check` function, specifically in how it handles the `pintuan_id` parameter. This parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without sufficient filtering or sanitization when it's passed to the `pe_select` function.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `pintuan_id` parameter, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query executed by the application.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the user-supplied `pintuan_id` parameter before using it in a database query.
    *   **Direct SQL Query Splicing:**  The `_dowhere` and `_doset` functions directly concatenate user-controlled data into SQL queries without proper escaping, making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, inject or modify data.
    *   The provided POC uses `SLEEP(5)` indicating that an attacker can also induce denial of service through time-based injection.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the `/index.php` endpoint. Specifically, the attacker crafts a malicious request targeting the `/module/index/cart.php` file with the `act` parameter set to `pintuan` and a malicious payload within the `pintuan_id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an ordinary user (authenticated to access the cart functionality).
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the application's structure and vulnerable parameters.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the server.
