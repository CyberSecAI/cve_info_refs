{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2019-9689",
    "description": "Remote denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in the axTLS library version 2.1.5 due to a lack of minimum size check for the received total certification length or the 'num_certs' variable during TLS certificate handshake processing.",
    "affected_component": "axTLS library",
    "affected_versions": "<= 2.1.5",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is in the function process_certificate, where the variable num_certs can be zero, leading to zero-sized memory allocations with calloc(...). Subsequent write and free operations use the zeroed variables certs and cert_used, potentially rewriting or removing memory of another process.",
    "attack_vector": "A TLS certificate handshake message with zero certificates is sent to the target system, causing the value of the variable num_certs to be zero.",
    "impact": "Remote denial of service (DoS). Disturbs the availability of a remote service or server. Operations could rewrite or remove memory of another process.",
    "weakness": "Lack of minimum size check for the received total certification length or the 'num_certs' variable. Improper 'security by design' in TLS implementation."
