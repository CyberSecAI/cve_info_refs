## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

New remote denial of service vulnerability
in axTLS zero size x509 certificate parsing
(CVE-2019-9689)
by Robert Hörr (Security Evaluator of the Telekom Security Evaluation Facility)

In  addition to  CVE-2019-8981  (CVS  version  3  score 9.8)  a new  remote denial of  service
(DoS)  vulnerability  (CVE-2019-9689) in  the axTLS  library  for embedded  devices  (version
2.1.5,  http://axtls.sourceforge.net)  was  discovered  on  2019  February  25  with  modern
fuzzing methods.  Unfortunately the vulnerability is not yet fixed.

How security-critical is the vulnerability?
This vulnerability may be used to perform a remote denial of service attack. The goal of a
denial of service attack is to disturb the availability of a remote service or server, e.g. any
access  axTLS  library.  Hence,  this  vulnerability  is  security-critical,  if  any  security  relevant
process depends on remote availability.

Where is the vulnerability in the source code?
The vulnerability is in the function process_certificate, which executes in the following way:

tls1_svr.c:
ret = process_certificate(ssl, &ssl->x509_ctx);

In  this  function,  the  variable  num_certs  can  be  zero  and  hence  the  following  memory
allocations with calloc(…), which are marked in bold, are also zero:

tls1.c:
int process_certificate(SSL *ssl, X509_CTX **x509_ctx)

X509_CTX **certs = 0;
int *cert_used = 0;

certs = (X509_CTX**) calloc(num_certs, sizeof(void*));
cert_used = (int*) calloc(num_certs, sizeof(int));

The following write and free operations use the variables certs and cert_used later, which
are  marked  in  bold.  The  function  ssl_free(...)  is  executed  to  clean  up  a  finished  TLS
connection.

tls1.c:
int process_certificate(SSL *ssl, X509_CTX **x509_ctx)

*x509_ctx = certs[0];
cert_used[0] = 1;

EXP_FUNC void STDCALL ssl_free(SSL *ssl)
    x509_free(ssl->x509_ctx);

x509.c:
void x509_free(X509_CTX *x509_ctx)
free(x509_ctx->ca_cert_dn[i]);
free(x509_ctx->cert_dn[i]);
…

Therefore, these operations could e.g. rewrite or remove memory of another process.

How can the vulnerability be exploited?
A TLS certificate handshake message with zero certificates is sent to the target system. In
this way, the value of the variable num_certs will be zero.

What do we learn from this?
This  vulnerability  is  critical  because  the  received  total  certification  length  or  the  variable
num_certs  is  not  checked  for  a  minimum  size.  That  is  a  typical  mistake,  if  “security  by
design” is not used properly. Especially an implementation of a security protocol like TLS
must take into account “security by design”.
Modern fuzzing methods or a source code review must be performed to find vulnerabilities.
These can exist mainly because “security by design” is not used. As software is becoming
more complex, modern fuzzing appears to be a better approach.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

Variant of Satori/Mirai detected attacking public available ADB shells

10 July 2018

On the 10th of July at 23:30 UTC we noticed an increased traffic on our blackhole monitoring on TCP port 5555. Upon further analyzation, we saw a big chunk of this traffic coming from China, USA and the Dominican Republic. In total we gathered 246.434 packets from 68.361 unique IPs. Based on the packet details we gathered, we can assume that the packets were generated by a lot of different devices. In addition, the traffic behavior on port 555 matches the typicall scan behavior of botnets.

5 Jan 2018

By misuse of several processor bugs it is possible to break up the separation between the kernel and user space.

## Deutsche Telekom CERT Assessment

On Intel CPU driven platforms, it is possible for normal user programs to gather information about protected kernel memory areas (“Meltdown attack”, CVE-2017-5754) [1] [2].  This results in an information leakage between kernel and user space.

This vulnerability affects every Intel CPU produced in the past decade (CPUs since 1995 except Itanium and pre-2013 Atoms). The in [3] listed ARM cores are also affected by this vulnerability.

A further issue is described in the “Spectre attack” (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715). Spectre allows a user-mode application to extract information from other processes or VMs to access memory of other VMs. This vulnerability affects all listed Intel CPUs, as well as AMD’s Ryzen, FX and Pro families and several ARM Cortex cores listed in [3].

Official disclosure for Spectre and Meltdown took place on 2018-01-04 [10].

To exploit both vulnerabilities an attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

Thus, up to now network components like routers, switches, firewalls, mobiles or CPEs don’t provide enough attack surface for exploitation even if they are affected. On most network components it is very difficult to run attacker crafted code because they’ve never been designed to run custom code.

## Recommendations

* Apply patches as soon as they are available from the respective supplier
  (for Microsoft desktop systems check availability with AV vendors [13])
* Top priority should be patching of (see timeline below)
  o   hypervisors of cloud systems
  o   operating systems of desktop clients and virtual/remote desktop systems
  o   operating systems of hosting platforms
* On XEN hypervisors:
  o   Enable “supervisor mode execute protection” if possible
  o   Evaluate if XEN VMs can be run in HVM or PVM mode (only PV hosting hypervisors are affected)
* For network components
  o   Even if an attack is unlikely ask your vendor if your device is vulnerable and needs patching

**Patch Prioritization**

In general high priority patching is advised for every machine which runs untrusted code from third parties. On shared and exclusive private clouds there is less risk because these platforms are dedicated to trusted customers. On all other servers it is unlikely that an attacker is able to run arbitrary code. Patch your system based on local patch cycles.

Due to the complexity of the attack it is unlikely that smartphones get exploited.

**Patch Availability**

* Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, 10 [5]
  o   McAfee is now patch compatible [12]
  o   Further AV vendors can be found in [13]
  o   A registry key has to be set. Without the key the client doesn’t fetch the update. See [5].
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016, Server Version 1709 Attention: The mitigation has to be enabled via registry [6]
* Mac OS X 10.13.1 (10.13.2 isn’t vulnerable)
* Several Suse Linux and RHEL distributions [7] [8]
* VMware ESXi 5.5 to 6.5, Workstation 12.X and 14.X, Fusion 8.X [9]
* Android (patchlevel 2018-01-05)
* iOS (patchlevel 11.2)

Linux Kernel patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-09.

IBM AIX patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-12 [11].

There is no announcement for a SOLARIS patch, we are in touch with Oracle.

Hi all,

Two Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities were found in the axTLS library (<http://axtls.sourceforge.net/>). Both
vulnerabilities were addressed to the project maintainer in a responsible disclosure.
Because the initial deadline was prolonged a few times to fix the issues, but we didn't received any feedback since
June, the vulnerability details are published now:
<https://www.telekom.com/en/corporate-responsibility/data-protection-data-security/security/details/advisories-504842>

Affected versions: axTLS <= 2.1.5

Detailed information about both vulnerabilities:
* CVE-2019-9689:
<https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/586428/51ae062269fbcb068bd20379f87f1398/dl-191121-critical-remote-denial-of-service-vulnerability-ii--data.pdf>
* CVE-2019-10013:
<https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/586416/12097aeb8f9a6bba89a804b94575521a/dl-191121-critical-remote-denial-of-service-vulnerability-i--data.pdf>
