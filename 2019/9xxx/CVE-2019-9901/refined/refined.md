Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9901:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The content directly relates to CVE-2019-9901. It describes a vulnerability in Envoy where HTTP URL paths are not normalized, allowing attackers to bypass access controls. This aligns with the official description of CVE-2019-9901.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that Envoy versions prior to 1.9.1 do not normalize HTTP URL paths before making access control or routing decisions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The core weakness is the lack of path normalization, which can lead to path traversal attacks. Attackers can use relative paths (e.g., `/something/../admin`) to access resources they should not be able to reach.
    *   **Bypassed Access Controls:** Because Envoy makes decisions based on unnormalized paths, access controls designed for normalized paths can be circumvented.
    *   **Impact on Filters:** The unnormalized path is used across all L7 filters which include RBAC, ext\_authz, and the rate limiting service making them vulnerable as well.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to restricted resources or functionalities.
    *   **Bypass DoS Prevention:**  Attackers can bypass denial-of-service prevention systems like rate limiting and authorization that are configured based on normalized paths.
    *   **Circumvent Security Policies:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass routing policies and access control mechanisms.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting HTTP requests with relative path URLs.
    *   **Untrusted Clients:** The relative path URLs must be delivered by an untrusted client.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Envoy proxy.
    *   **Understanding of Target System:** The attacker needs to understand how the target system's access controls and routing are set up (usually prefix-based path matching)

**3. Technical Details**
   *   **Normalization:** The vulnerability arises due to a lack of normalization of the URL path, specifically the handling of relative path components like `..` and `.`.
   *  **Mitigation:**
         *   **Path Normalization:** The fix is implemented in Envoy 1.9.1 which normalizes URL path using a port of the Chromium URL library. This is enabled through `HttpConnectionManager.normalize_path`.
         *  **Configuration** This fix is not enabled by default for backward compatibility.
   *  **Affected Components:** The vulnerability affects any component using the unnormalized path including RBAC, HTTP routing, external authorization, rate limiting service.
   * **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 8.3 (High) with the vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L.

**4. Additional Notes**

*   The provided content includes a discussion of the issue and how to fix it in Envoy 1.9.1. The fix involves normalizing the URL path according to RFC 3986.
*   The content mentions that the unnormalized view of the path is used for routing and all L7 filter execution including RBAC, ext\_authz, and the rate-limiting service, which expands the scope of the vulnerability to multiple components.
*  The content explicitly mentions that other proxies like Nginx do have a distinction between normalization for matching and normalization for path forwarding.

In summary, CVE-2019-9901 is a critical vulnerability due to the ease with which attackers can exploit it, and the wide range of components it affects. The core issue is Envoy's failure to normalize HTTP URL paths which enables attackers to bypass access controls and routing policies.
