CVE-2019-9813: Ionmonkey type confusion with __proto__ mutations

Root cause of vulnerability:
Incorrect handling of `__proto__` mutations in the IonMonkey JIT compiler.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
Type confusion in the IonMonkey JIT compiler due to incorrect handling of `__proto__` mutations. The vulnerability was caused by an old bug in the type inference engine of IonMonkey. The incorrect handling leads to a situation where compiled JavaScript code may treat an object as a different type than it is, thus leading to memory corruption and potentially exploitable crashes

Impact of exploitation:
Arbitrary memory read and write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and sandbox escape

Attack vectors:
Malicious JavaScript code that leverages the type confusion in the IonMonkey JIT compiler. The vulnerability was triggered through manipulating the prototype chain via `__proto__`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Ability to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a vulnerable browser or runtime.
