Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the article editor of the DoyoCMS. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or encode special characters such as `<` and `>`, which allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the malicious script is saved in the database and executed when a user views the affected content (article).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various impacts, such as:
  - Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
  - Defacement of the website.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim (if the user is logged in).
  - Potentially stealing sensitive information.
  - Privilege escalation (if the compromised user is an administrator).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the article management editor within the DoyoCMS admin panel.
- An attacker can inject the malicious payload into the article content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the article editor, which requires administrator privileges.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker injects the following payload into the article content: `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
- This payload demonstrates the vulnerability by triggering an alert box containing the user's cookies.
- The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper input sanitization when saving article content in the DoyoCMS.
