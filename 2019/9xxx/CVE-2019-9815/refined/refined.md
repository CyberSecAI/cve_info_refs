Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9815:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the use of hyperthreading on CPUs which enables timing attacks, similar to Spectre attacks. Specifically, when hyperthreading is enabled, threads can share a physical core, which allows an attacker to perform timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability stems from the CPU's hyperthreading functionality, which allows for timing-based side-channel attacks.
- The core issue is that when hyperthreading is enabled, threads share a physical core, enabling timing attacks like the Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) attacks, specifically RIDL (Rogue In-Flight Data Load) and Fallout.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to an attacker leaking private data across arbitrary security boundaries.
- Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information from other programs running on the same machine, including other applications, the operating system kernel, other VMs, or secure enclaves. This could include credentials, encryption keys, or any other sensitive data residing in memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be performed by an attacker running unprivileged code on a system with vulnerable Intel CPUs.
- This can be done through shared cloud computing resources, JavaScript code on malicious websites, or malicious advertisements.
- The attacker leverages timing variations caused by hyperthreading to leak sensitive data from internal CPU buffers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- This code does not need to have elevated privileges.
-  The attacker needs a vulnerable CPU with hyperthreading enabled to exploit this issue. Specifically, macOS users on versions prior to 10.14.5 are vulnerable as the fix relies on a new sysctl call in 10.14.5.

**Additional Information:**
- This issue is related to the broader class of Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) vulnerabilities, specifically RIDL and Fallout, which target in-flight data in CPU buffers.
- Apple implemented a new sysctl in macOS 10.14.5 that allows applications to disable hyperthreading on specific threads, which Firefox leverages.
- Disabling hyperthreading is a mitigation strategy that can reduce the impact of MDS based attacks.
