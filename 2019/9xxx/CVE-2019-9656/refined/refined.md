Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9656:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the `OFXApplication::startElement` function located in `lib/ofx_sgml.cpp`. This occurs due to improper error checking, leading to a situation where the code attempts to access a memory location pointed to by a NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code dereferences a NULL pointer, causing the program to crash. This indicates a lack of proper validation and error handling when parsing the input data.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input file that exploits the parser's logic. The parser does not adequately validate the structure and content of the input, leading to the problematic state.
- **Potential OpenSP Library Interaction:** Some logs hint that the issue may be related to interactions with the OpenSP library, especially versions <= 1.3.4, which might not properly handle data in certain scenarios causing data loss that is not handled properly later, leading to the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the affected application, which results in a denial of service. This can interrupt normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted OFX File:** The primary attack vector involves supplying a specially crafted OFX file to the vulnerable application (e.g., using the `ofxdump` tool, which uses the vulnerable `libofx` library). This file triggers the NULL pointer dereference, causing the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input File:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted OFX file as input to a program that uses the vulnerable `libofx` library. This could be achieved in various scenarios, such as:
  - **Local access:** An attacker could supply the file locally if they have access to the system.
  - **Remote access:** If the application accepts OFX files from a network source, a remote attacker could trigger the vulnerability.
- **Basic Knowledge of OFX Structure:**  The attacker requires some knowledge of the OFX file structure to craft a file that specifically triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `OFXApplication::startElement` function, which is part of the libofx library used for parsing OFX files.
- The vulnerable code is specifically found in `lib/ofx_sgml.cpp` at line 129.
- The exploit was demonstrated using a proof-of-concept file named `null-poniter-dereference-poc-1` with the ofxdump tool.
- Patches have been released to address this vulnerability, specifically in Debian and Ubuntu.
