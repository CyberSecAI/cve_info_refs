  "CVE-2019-9503": {
    "description": "The Broadcom brcmfmac WiFi driver prior to commit a4176ec356c73a46c07c181c6d04039fafa34a9f is vulnerable to a frame validation bypass. If the brcmfmac driver receives a firmware event frame from a remote source, the is_wlc_event_frame function will cause this frame to be discarded and unprocessed. If the driver receives the firmware event frame from the host, the appropriate handler is called. This frame validation can be bypassed if the bus used is USB (for instance by a wifi dongle). This can allow firmware event frames from a remote source to be processed. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the brcmfmac driver's failure to properly validate the source of firmware event frames when using the USB bus. The `is_wlc_event_frame` function, intended to prevent remote event frame processing, is bypassed due to the driver processing logic not checking the source of firmware events when received via the USB bus. ",

    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system, or more typically, cause a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote, over-the-air WiFi attack"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within WiFi range and be able to send specially-crafted WiFi packets. No authentication is required.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `brcmfmac` driver, particularly in the function `brcmf_rx_frame` when it is called for a USB device. The fix addresses the issue by adding an additional check based on the subtype of the firmware event in `brcmf_fweh_process_skb` to validate the authenticity of the frame. This check is only added when the bus is USB or PCI, as devices using the SDIO bus already have separate channels for event frames.",
