- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PrinterLogic Print Management software does not sanitize special characters in browser input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization leading to unauthorized changes to configuration files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can remotely modify configuration files. This could lead to remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on workstations running the PrinterLogic agent.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web browser interface used to interact with the PrinterLogic agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted input through a web browser to the PrinterLogic agent. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
