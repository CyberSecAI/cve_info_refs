{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `wlc_wpa_sup_eapol` function within the Broadcom wl driver. This function processes EAPOL message 3 during the 4-way handshake from the access point (AP). It extracts a vendor information element and copies its data to a fixed-size buffer using memcpy, without proper bounds checking on the length of the data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow due to missing bounds check on the length of the vendor information element data.",
      "Use of a fixed-size buffer (32 bytes) for copying variable-length vendor IE data."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability leads to denial-of-service conditions due to the heap buffer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted WiFi packet, specifically an EAPOL message 3 with a vendor information element containing data larger than 32 bytes.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within the wireless range of the target and able to act as a malicious access point (AP) or to control a legitimate one. They also need the capability to craft and send malicious EAPOL frames during the 4-way handshake with the target."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    {
      "component": "Broadcom wl driver",
      "details": "The vulnerability exists within the Broadcom's proprietary wl driver. This driver is used in both SoftMAC and FullMAC chipsets, so the vulnerability will be triggered in the host's kernel in the former case, or on the chipset's firmware in the latter."
    }
  ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing an EAPOL message 3 during the 4-way handshake from the access point (AP). The vulnerability exists in the parsing of Vendor Information Elements (IEs), which are Tag-Length-Value data structures. If the vendor IE has a data length larger than 32 bytes, a heap buffer overflow is triggered in `wlc_wpa_sup_eapol`."
