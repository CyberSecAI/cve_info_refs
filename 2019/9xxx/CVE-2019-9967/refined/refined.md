The provided content discusses multiple crashes in XnView Classic 2.48 and XnView MP 0.93.1 discovered through fuzzing. It includes crash details from WinDbg. The blog post mentions that these crashes were later assigned CVEs, including CVE-2019-9967, but it does not specifically describe the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-9967, instead it provides general crash information for multiple vulnerabilities.

Based on the provided content, here is the extracted information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The blog post describes the discovery of multiple crashes through fuzzing. It doesn't specify the exact root cause for each CVE, but it shows crash dumps in different functions, such as `memcpy`, `RtlFreeHeap`, `RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey`, `RtlReAllocateHeap` and other functions related to memory management and system calls. It highlights crashes in  `xnview` specific code as well.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The blog post indicates memory corruption vulnerabilities leading to crashes like:
- Heap corruption
- Invalid memory access
- Use-after-free

**Impact of exploitation:** The impact is a crash of the application. The blog post doesn't provide details about potential for arbitrary code execution, but the nature of crashes, especially those in memory management functions, suggests a potential for more severe impact like arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is opening a crafted malicious file in XnView that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the user to be opened with the vulnerable XnView application.
