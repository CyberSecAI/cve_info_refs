Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a compartment mismatch within the JavaScript engine when using the `fetch` API. Specifically, the `JS::ReadableStreamGetMode` function was called without ensuring that the provided JSContext was in the same compartment as the stream object, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Compartment Mismatch:** The primary weakness is that the code did not properly handle objects from different JavaScript compartments, leading to incorrect assumptions about the context when calling `JS::ReadableStreamGetMode`.
- **Lack of Context Checking:** The code was missing a check to ensure the JSContext used to access a ReadableStream was in the same compartment as the ReadableStream itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a browser crash, specifically a segmentation fault due to the compartment mismatch.
- **Potential for Exploitation:** The crash is considered potentially exploitable, implying that further exploitation could lead to code execution, but no details of a specific exploitation path are provided.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Page:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious web page using the `fetch` API in a specific way that leads to the compartment mismatch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Execution in a Web Context:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute JavaScript code within a web page loaded in Firefox. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious web page or through some form of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
- **Knowledge of API Usage:** The attacker needs to craft a specific sequence of API calls involving `fetch`, responses, and ReadableStreams to trigger the compartment mismatch.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**
- The vulnerability occurs during the handling of a response body within the `fetch` API and the `Cache` API.
- A `ReadableStream` object is involved and the `JS::ReadableStreamGetMode()` function is called.
- The crash happens within `APIUnwrapAndDowncast<js::ReadableStream>` when the function is called with a JSContext that belongs to a different JavaScript compartment than the `ReadableStream` object.
- The vulnerability is triggered when using the `put` method of the `Cache` API, using a response obtained with the `fetch` API.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by using `AutoRealm` before calling `JS::ReadableStreamGetMode()`. `AutoRealm` ensures that the function is called within the correct compartment.

**Additional Information:**
- The bug was introduced by bug 1486698, which changed the way disturbed and locked streams were handled.
- The fix was applied to Firefox 67 and ESR60 branches.
- The bug was considered a high severity security issue.

In summary, CVE-2019-9819 is a high-severity vulnerability caused by a compartment mismatch in the handling of `ReadableStream` objects when using the `fetch` API in Firefox. It can lead to a potentially exploitable crash, with an attack vector involving a specially crafted web page. The fix is to ensure that calls to `JS::ReadableStreamGetMode()` are made in the correct JavaScript compartment.
