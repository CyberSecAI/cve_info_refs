  },
  "impact": {
    "description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a flood of empty frames, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. These frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The peer spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU.",
    "impact": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in some HTTP/2 implementations due to a flood of empty frames. An attacker sends a stream of empty frames without the end-of-stream flag, which leads the peer to spend time processing each frame, consuming excess CPU and potentially leading to denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the HTTP/2 protocol.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to establish HTTP/2 connections with a vulnerable server, which is typically done over a network. They can be unauthenticated.",
        "weaknesses": "The core weakness is insufficient handling and rate limiting of empty HTTP/2 frames which leads to excessive resource consumption and thus a denial of service.  Implementations lack proper input validation and rate limiting for specific HTTP/2 frame types. Specifically empty frames without the end-of-stream flag are not properly handled, resulting in a denial of service when flooded.",
    "required_attacker_position": "The attacker can be remote as they only need to send specially crafted HTTP/2 traffic to the vulnerable server."
