- **Vulnerability:** XSS in the `item_title` layout in edit views.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of proper output escaping in the `item_title` layout.
- **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to user compromise (e.g., stealing credentials, performing actions on behalf of the user).
- **Affected Versions:** Joomla! CMS versions 3.2.0 through 3.9.3.
- **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious code into the `item_title` layout, which is then rendered without proper escaping.
- **Required Capabilities:** Ability to modify/control the `item_title` field (likely requires authenticated access with appropriate permissions to edit items).
- **Solution:** Upgrade to version 3.9.4.
