#### Vulnerability Note VU#174715

### Description

MyCar add smartphone-controlled geolocation, remote start/stop and lock/unlock capabilities to a vehicle with a compatible remote start unit. The MyCar Controls mobile application contains hard-coded admin credentials ([CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)) which can be used in place of a user's username and password to communicate with the server endpoint for a target user's account.

| --- |

### Impact

| --- |

### Solution

| **Update Phone App**  AutoMobility has updated their mobile apps to remove the hard coded credentials. On iOS the updated version is v3.4.24, and on Android the updated version is v4.1.2.Additionally the admin credentials in old versions of the mobile application have been revoked. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| The MyCar unit and corresponding mobile application may be rebranded and sold by other vendors as something other than MyCar. Other brands include:   * Carlink * Linkr * Visions MyCar * MyCar Kia  These brands have also been updated. |

### Poor customer service

> I had this system put in a few years ago. It worked great until I was forced to purchase an âupgradeâ so that I could keep using the app. I work in a building too far away from where my car is parked for a fob to work so they had me in a corner. I got the upgraded device and had the dealer where I purchased it put it in. It didnât work long. I have tried everything they have told me to do. I even took it back to the installer and they checked everything out and said it was the app. The fob works fine. Customer service simply stops responding to you when they realize they sent you a defective product. I paid for three years to use this item. They have taken my money and are happy to ignore any issues with their product. Itâs virtually useless to me at this point and winter where I live, which is why I have it in the first place. I cannot recommend this to anyone because they are only after your hard earned money and wonât back up their product. Iâm guessing they control what reviews get posted about them as well since I have not seen my review anywhere

### It works 95% time for me

> I have been using this app for two years with âfortinâ remote start module. I do have problem, but most of the time its accurate and responds to the commands. Every software or hardware do give problem sometime, so in this sense this app or hardware is not that bad. I can deal with 5% problem. I love it and i will definitely recommend it. It saves me lots of trouble, i can start, lock/unlock doors with visible confirmation and see the location of my car also can see the status of the car battery.

### App works with properly installed systems

> I think this app is getting a bad reputation not because of the app itself but because of the installation of the receiver in the car. The receiver has to be mounted with a certain side facing upward and away from metal objects. I installed mine myself and originally did not have it installed in the correct manner. Mine like many of the bad reviews here worked very sporadically. I thought the problem was in the app. After bad results for the first month or two I went back and redid the installation of the receiver per the instructions. I located it near the top of the dash, the correct side facing up and away from metal. This remote start system works 100% of the time now. If your system is working with limited success I can almost guarantee you receiver is installed improperly.
