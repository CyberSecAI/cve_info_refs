Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9493:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MyCar Controls mobile applications (both iOS and Android versions) contained hard-coded administrative credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798):** The applications included administrative usernames and passwords directly within their code. This is a critical security flaw, as it makes it easy for attackers to discover and exploit these credentials by reverse-engineering the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access and control:** An attacker could use the hard-coded credentials in place of a legitimate user's credentials to communicate with the server endpoint.
*   **Remote commands:** This access would allow an attacker to send commands to the targeted MyCar unit, such as:
    *   Remote start/stop the engine
    *   Lock/unlock the vehicle doors
    *   Potentially control other vehicle functions depending on the configuration.
*   **Location tracking:** The attacker could retrieve the vehicle's GPS location.
*   **Physical access:** The ability to remotely unlock doors could lead to unauthorized physical access to the vehicle and its contents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network based:** The attack can be performed remotely, as the application communicates with a server endpoint via the internet.
*   **Application-based:** The attacker needs to obtain a vulnerable version of the mobile application to extract the hard-coded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Reverse engineering:** Ability to reverse-engineer the application to extract the hard-coded credentials from the app's code.
*   **Network access:** Ability to communicate with the MyCar server endpoint using the extracted credentials.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to bypass normal authentication procedures using the hard-coded credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects MyCar Controls mobile applications before version 3.4.24 on iOS and before version 4.1.2 on Android.
*   The issue has been resolved by removing the hard-coded credentials in the updated app versions, and the old credentials have been revoked.
*   The MyCar unit and app are sometimes rebranded and sold by other vendors, which were also impacted by this vulnerability and received updates. Some of the other brands include Carlink, Linkr, Visions MyCar, and MyCar Kia.
