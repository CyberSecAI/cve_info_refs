  "CVE-2019-9792": {
    "description": "The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal `JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT` magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.",

    "impact": "Memory corruption and potentially exploitable crash.",
    "attack_vector": "Malicious JavaScript code that can trigger a JIT bailout.",

     "root_cause": "The IonMonkey JIT compiler leaks an internal JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT magic value during a bailout which can be used to cause memory corruption."
