|  |  | | **Liveness face authentication bypass - lack of valitadion** **2019-05-15 / 2019-05-21** **br [Joao Pimenta](https://cxsecurity.com/author/Joao%2BPimenta/1/) **(BR)** br** Risk: **High** Local: **No** Remote: ****Yes**** CVE: **[CVE-2019-9196](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2019-9196/ "Click to see CVE-2019-9196")** CWE: **[CWE-287](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-287 "CWE-287")**  CVSS Base Score: **5/10** Impact Subscore: **2.9/10** Exploitability Subscore: **10/10** Exploit range: **Remote** Attack complexity: **Low** Authentication: **No required** Confidentiality impact: **None** Integrity impact: **Partial** Availability impact: **None** | | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The Face authentication component in Aware mobile liveness 2.2.1 sdk 2.2.0 for Knomi allows a Biometrical Liveness authentication bypass via parameter tampering of the /knomi/analyze security\_level dropping it down and getting an approval score (100%) back from the server.
The exploitation is also possible reverse engineering the sdk base changing the security\_level parameter to achieve the OK from the server. The server does not properly validate the value sent by the SDK.

In matrix-js-sdk versions versions 9.11.0 through 34.7.0, the method `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys` is vulnerable to interception by malicious homeservers. The method was introduced by MSC3061) and is commonly used to share historical message keys with newly invited users, granting them access to past messages in the room. However, it unconditionally sends these "shared" keys to all of the invited user's devices, regardless of whether the user's cryptographic identity is verified or whether the user's devices are signed by that identity. This allows the attacker to potentially inject its own devices to receive sensitive historical keys without proper security checks. Note that this only affects clients running the SDK with the legacy crypto stack. Clients using the new Rust cryptography stack (i.e. those that call `MatrixClient.initRustCrypto()` instead of `MatrixClient.initCrypto()`) are unaffected by this vulnerability, because `MatrixClient.sendSharedHistoryKeys()` raises an exception in such environments. The vulnerability was fixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.8.0 by removing the vulnerable functionality.
