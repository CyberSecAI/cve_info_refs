Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9196:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the `security_level` parameter by the server in the Aware mobile liveness SDK. The server does not verify the security level sent by the SDK during the liveness check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Authentication:** The primary weakness is the improper authentication mechanism, specifically the lack of validation of parameters used during the face authentication process. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `security_level` parameter to bypass the intended liveness detection.
- **Parameter Tampering:** The SDK sends a `security_level` parameter to the `/knomi/analyze` endpoint. By altering this parameter, an attacker can effectively disable or reduce the security checks.
- **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The server fails to validate the `security_level` parameter received from the client SDK, making it susceptible to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Biometric Liveness Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the facial liveness detection mechanism. By setting the security\_level parameter to a lower value, it makes it easier to achieve an approval score from the server, even without genuine liveness.
- **Unauthorized Access:** A successful bypass could lead to unauthorized access to systems or services protected by the flawed facial recognition authentication.
- **Integrity Impact:** The integrity of the authentication process is partially compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, over the network.
- **Parameter Tampering:** The primary attack vector involves modifying the `security_level` parameter sent to the server.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Attackers can also achieve this by reverse-engineering the SDK base and directly altering the `security_level` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to communicate with the server hosting the authentication service.
- **SDK access (optional):** While not strictly required as parameter tampering can occur without SDK access, reverse engineering of the SDK is an alternative method of exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Understanding of the API:** A basic understanding of how the `/knomi/analyze` API endpoint and its parameters work is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified in Aware mobile liveness 2.2.1 SDK 2.2.0 for Knomi.
