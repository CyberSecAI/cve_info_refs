Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-9631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `downsample_row_box_filter` function within the `CairoRescaleBox.cc` file of the Poppler library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   Heap-based buffer over-read. Specifically, the code reads beyond the allocated memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service:** The over-read can cause a crash.
-   **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution**: Depending on the circumstances and what memory is overwritten, there is a potential for arbitrary code execution. (this is only speculated).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a user or an automated system into opening a malicious PDF file which triggers the vulnerable code path

**Technical Details:**
- The ASAN report shows a read of size 4 at a memory address located beyond the allocated region in `downsample_row_box_filter`.
- Debug output indicates an issue with the `start_coverage` array which results in a heap overrun at x = 8192 during the downscaling process.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information indicates the root cause is related to the `start_coverage` array.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted PDF file to pdftocairo.
- Fedora, Debian and RedHat released security updates to address the issue.
