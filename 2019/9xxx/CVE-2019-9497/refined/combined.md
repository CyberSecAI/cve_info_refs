| [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1056061#c6)  Johannes Segitz   2017-10-16 09:56:28 UTC  ``` From: Jouni Malinen  Published: October 16, 2017 Identifiers: - CERT case ID: VU#228519 - CVE-2017-13077 - CVE-2017-13078 - CVE-2017-13079 - CVE-2017-13080 - CVE-2017-13081 - CVE-2017-13082 - CVE-2017-13084 (not applicable) - CVE-2017-13086 - CVE-2017-13087 - CVE-2017-13088 Latest version available from: <https://w1.fi/security/2017-1/>  Vulnerability  A vulnerability was found in how a number of implementations can be triggered to reconfigure WPA/WPA2/RSN keys (TK, GTK, or IGTK) by replaying a specific frame that is used to manage the keys. Such reinstallation of the encryption key can result in two different types of vulnerabilities: disabling replay protection and significantly reducing the security of encryption to the point of allowing frames to be decrypted or some parts of the keys to be determined by an attacker depending on which cipher is used.  This document focuses on the cases that apply to systems using hostapd (AP) or wpa_supplicant (station), but it should be noted that the generic vulnerability itself is applicable to other implementations and may have different impact in other cases.  This vulnerability can in theory apply to any case where a TK (the pairwise/unicast encryption key used with TKIP, CCMP, GCMP), a GTK (group/multicast encryption key), or an IGTK (group management frame integrity protection key) is configured by the Authentication/Supplicant component to the WLAN driver/firmware taking care of the TX/RX path and encryption/decryption of frames.  If the same key is configured multiple times, it is likely that the transmit and receive packet numbers (PN, IPN, RSC/TSC, etc.) are cleared to a smaller value (zero in case of pairwise keys, zero or at least a smaller value than the last used value in case of group keys). When this happens with the same key, this breaks replay protection on RX side and can result in reuse of packet numbers on TX side. The former may allow replaying of previously delivered packets (without the attacker being able to decrypt them or modify their contents) while the latter may result in more severe issues on the TX side due to resulting CCM nonce replay and related issues with GCMP and TKIP. The TX side issue may make it significantly easier for the attacker to decrypt frames and determine some parts of the keys (e.g., a Michael MIC key in case of TKIP).  Impact on AP/hostapd  On the AP side, this generic issue has been determined to be applicable in the case where hostapd is used to operate an RSN/WPA2 network with FT (Fast BSS Transition from IEEE 802.11r) enabled. Replaying of the Reassociation Request frame can be used to get the AP reinstalling the TK which results in the AP accepting previously delivered unicast frames from the station and the AP reusing previously used packet numbers (local TX packet number gets reset to zero). This latter issue on the TX side can result in CCM nonce reuse which invalidates CCMP security properties. In case of TKIP this can result in the attacker being able to determine part of the TK more easily and with GCMP, result in similar issues.  It should be noted that the AP side issue with FT would be close to applying to FILS authentication (from IEEE 802.11ai) in hostapd with replaying of (Re)Association Request frames. However, due to a different handling of the repeated association processing with FILS, this would actually result in the station getting immediately disconnected which prevents this attack in practice. In addition, the FILS implementation in the current hostapd version is still experimental and documented as being discouraged in production use cases.  Another area of potentially reduced security was identified when looking into these issues. When AP/Authenticator implementation in hostapd is requested to rekey the PTK without performing EAP reauthentication (either through local periodic rekeying or due to a request from an association station), the ANonce value does not get updated. This results in the new 4-way handshake depending on the station/supplicant side generating a new, unique (for the current PMK/PSK) SNonce for the PTK derivation to result in a new key. While a properly working supplicant would do so, if there is a supplicant implementation that does not, this combination could result in deriving the same PTK again. When the TK from that PTK gets configured in the driver, this would result in reinstalling the same key and the same issues as described above for the FT protocol case.  Impact on station/wpa_supplicant  On the station side, this generic issue has been determined to be applicable in the cases where wpa_supplicant processes a group key (GTK or IGTK) update from the AP. An attacker that is able to limit access to frame delivery may be able to extract two update messages and deliver those to the station with significant time delay between them. When wpa_supplicant processes the second message, it may end up reinstalling the same key to the driver and when doing this, clear the RX packet number to an old value. This would allow the attacker to replay all group-addressed frames that the AP sent between the time the key update message was originally sent and the time when the attacker forwarded the second frame to the station. The attacker would not be able to decrypt or modify the frames based on this vulnerability, though. There is an exception to this with older wpa_supplicant versions as noted below in version specific notes.  For the current wpa_supplicant version (v2.6), there is also an additional EAPOL-Key replay sequence where an additional forged EAPOL-Key message can be used to bypass the existing protection for the pairwise key reconfiguration in a manner that ends up configuring a known TK that an attacker could use to decrypt any frame sent by the station and to inject arbitrary unicast frames. Similar issues are reachable in older versions as noted below.  PeerKey / TDLS PeerKey  As far as the related CVE-2017-13084 (reinstallation of the STK key in the PeerKey handshake) is concerned, it should be noted that PeerKey implementation in wpa_supplicant is not fully functional and the actual installation of the key into the driver does not work. As such, this item is not applicable in practice. Furthermore, the PeerKey handshake for IEEE 802.11e DLS is obsolete and not known to have been deployed.  As far as the TDLS PeerKey handshake is concerned (CVE-2017-13086), wpa_supplicant implementation is already rejecting TPK M2 retries, so the reconfiguration issue cannot apply for it. For TPK M3, there is a theoretical impact. However, if that frame is replayed, the current wpa_supplicant implementation ends up tearing down the TDLS link immediately and as such, there is no real window for performing the attack. Furthermore, TPK M3 goes through the AP path and if RSN is used there, that frame has replay protection, so the attacker could not perform the attack. If the AP path were to use WEP, the frame could be replayed, though. That said, if WEP is used on the AP path, it would be fair to assume that there is no security in the network, so a new attack vector would be of small additional value.  With older wpa_supplicant versions, it may be possible for an attacker to cause TPK M2 to be retransmitted with delay that would be able to trigger reinstallation of TK on the peer receiving TPK M2 (CVE-2017-13086). This may open a short window for the attack with v2.3, v2.4, and v2.5; and a longer window with older versions.  Vulnerable versions/configurations  For the AP/Authenticator TK (unicast) reinstallation in FT protocol (CVE-2017-13082):  hostapd v0.7.2 and newer with FT enabled (i.e., practically all versions that include full FT implementation). FT needs to be enabled in the runtime configuration to make this applicable.  For the AP/Authenticator missing ANonce during PTK rekeying:  All hostapd versions.  For the station/Supplicant side GTK/IGTK reinstallation and TK configuration:  All wpa_supplicant versions. The impact on older versions can be more severe due to earlier changes in this area: v2.3 and older can also reinstall the pairwise key and as such have similar impact as the AP FT case (CVE-2017-13077); v2.4 and v2.5 end up configuring an all-zero TK which breaks the normal data path, but could allow an attacker to decrypt all following frames from the station and to inject arbitrary frames to the station. In addition, a different message sequence involving 4-way handshake can result in configuration of an all-zero TK in v2.6 and the current snapshot of the development repository as of the publication of this advisory.

Van Boxtel for finding additional issues related to this topic.   Possible mitigation steps  - For AP/hostapd and FT replay issue (CVE-2017-13082), it is possible to   prevent the issue temporarily by disabling FT in runtime   configuration, if needed before being able to update the   implementations.  - Merge the following commits to hostapd/wpa_supplicant and rebuild them:    hostapd and replayed FT reassociation request frame (CVE-2017-13082):   hostapd: Avoid key reinstallation in FT handshake    hostapd PTK rekeying and ANonce update:   Fix PTK rekeying to generate a new ANonce    wpa_supplicant and GTK/IGTK rekeying (CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079,   CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13081, CVE-2017-13087, CVE-2017-13088):   Prevent reinstallation of an already in-use group key   Extend protection of GTK/IGTK reinstallation of WNM-Sleep Mode cases    wpa_supplicant (v2.6 or newer snapshot) and known TK issue:   Prevent installation of an all-zero TK    Additional protection steps for wpa_supplicant:   TDLS: Reject TPK-TK reconfiguration   WNM: Ignore WNM-Sleep Mode Response without pending request   FT: Do not allow multiple Reassociation Response frames    These patches are available from <https://w1.fi/security/2017-1/>   (both against the snapshot of hostap.git master branch and rebased on   top of the v2.6 release)    For the TDLS TPK M2 retransmission issue (CVE-2017-13086) with older   wpa_supplicant versions, consider updating to the latest version or   merge in a commit that is present in v2.6:   <https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=dabdef9e048b17b22b1c025ad592922eab30dda8>   ('TDLS: Ignore incoming TDLS Setup Response retries')  - Update to hostapd/wpa_supplicant v2.7 or newer, once available   * it should be noted that there are number of additional changes in     the related areas of the implementation to provide extra layer of     protection for potential unknown issues; these changes are not     included in this advisory as they have not been identified to be     critical for preventing any of the identified security     vulnerabilities; however, users of hostapd/wpa_supplicant are     encouraged to consider merging such changes even if not fully     moving to v2.7 ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1056061#c8)  Johannes Segitz   2017-10-16 10:00:40 UTC  ``` hostap part will be dealt with in [bsc#1063479](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1063479) ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1056061#c14)  Swamp Workflow Management   2017-10-17 16:11:40 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2017:2745-1: An update that fixes 6 vulnerabilities is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1699153#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-11 22:28:30 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in hostapd. When used to operate an access point with SAE (SimultaneousAuthentication of Equals; also known as WPA3-Personal), an invalid authentication sequence could result in the hostapd process terminating due to a NULL pointer dereference when processing SAE confirm message. This was caused by missing state validation steps when processing the SAE confirm message in hostapd/AP mode. An attacker in radio range of an access point using hostapd in SAE configuration could use this issue to perform a denial of service attack by forcing the hostapd process to terminate.   References: <https://w1.fi/security/2019-3/sae-confirm-missing-state-validation.txt> <https://wpa3.mathyvanhoef.com/>  Upstream Patch: <https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=ac8fa9ef198640086cf2ce7c94673be2b6a018a0>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1699153#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-11 22:28:46 UTC  ``` Created hostapd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1699155](show_bug.cgi?id=1699155 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9496 hostapd: SAE confirm missing state validation in hostapd/AP [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1699154](show_bug.cgi?id=1699154 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9496 hostapd: SAE confirm missing state validation in hostapd/AP [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1699153#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-12 14:28:37 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 do not ship hostapd and they are not affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1699153#c4)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-12 14:30:42 UTC  ``` According to the external reference: "Similar cases against the wpa_supplicant SAE station implementation had already been tested by the hwsim test cases, but those sequences did not trigger this specific code path in AP mode which is why the issue was not discovered earlier."  wpa_supplicant as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not compiled with CONFIG_SAE=y, but even if it was, this flaw would not affect it in AP mode anyway.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1699153#c5)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-12 20:30:50 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Mathy Vanhoef (NYUAD), Eyal Ronen (Tel Aviv University & KU Leuven)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1699153#c6)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-12 20:30:52 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://w1.fi/security/2019-3/sae-confirm-missing-state-validation.txt> <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/871675/>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1699153#c8)  Fedora Update System    2019-04-23 18:49:17 UTC  ``` hostapd-2.7-2.fc28 has been pushed to the Fedora 28 stable repository.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9496.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9498.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9497 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9497)

#### Description

The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server and wpa\_supplicant EAP Peer do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, unless the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will not be able to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa\_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa\_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.

**Detail**

* CVE-2019-9494

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
  + The implementations of SAE in hostapd and wpa\_supplicant are vulnerable to side channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side channel attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa\_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
* CVE-2019-9495

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
  + The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd and wpa\_supplicant are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. All versions of hostapd and wpa\_supplicant with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The ability to install and execute applications is necessary for a successful attack. Memory access patterns are visible in a shared cache. Weak passwords may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa\_supplicant 2.7 and newer, are not vulnerable to the timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa\_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
* CVE-2019-9496

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 6.5
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
  + An invalid authentication sequence could result in the hostapd process terminating due to missing state validation steps when processing the SAE confirm message when in hostapd/AP mode. All version of hostapd with SAE support are vulnerable. An attacker may force the hostapd process to terminate, performing a denial of service attack. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa\_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
* CVE-2019-9497

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
  + The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server and wpa\_supplicant EAP Peer do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, unless the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will not be able to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa\_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa\_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
* CVE-2019-9498

  + Severity: Moderate

Package        : wpa
Version        : 2.3-1+deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-9495 CVE-2019-9497 CVE-2019-9498 CVE-2019-9499
                 CVE-2019-11555
Debian Bug     : 927463

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in WPA supplicant / hostapd. Some
of them could only partially be mitigated, please read below for details.

CVE-2019-9495

    Cache-based side-channel attack against the EAP-pwd implementation:
    an attacker able to run unprivileged code on the target machine
    (including for example javascript code in a browser on a smartphone)
    during the handshake could deduce enough information to discover the
    password in a dictionary attack.

    This issue has only very partially been mitigated against by reducing
    measurable timing differences during private key operations. More
    work is required to fully mitigate this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9497

    Reflection attack against EAP-pwd server implementation: a lack of
    validation of received scalar and elements value in the
    EAP-pwd-Commit messages could have resulted in attacks that would
    have been able to complete EAP-pwd authentication exchange without
    the attacker having to know the password. This did not result in the
    attacker being able to derive the session key, complete the following
    key exchange and access the network.

CVE-2019-9498

    EAP-pwd server missing commit validation for scalar/element: hostapd
    didn't validate values received in the EAP-pwd-Commit message, so an
    attacker could have used a specially crafted commit message to
    manipulate the exchange in order for hostapd to derive a session key
    from a limited set of possible values. This could have resulted in an
    attacker being able to complete authentication and gain access to the
    network.

    This issue could only partially be mitigated.

CVE-2019-9499

    EAP-pwd peer missing commit validation for scalar/element:
    wpa_supplicant didn't validate values received in the EAP-pwd-Commit
    message, so an attacker could have used a specially crafted commit
    message to manipulate the exchange in order for wpa_supplicant to
    derive a session key from a limited set of possible values. This
    could have resulted in an attacker being able to complete
    authentication and operate as a rogue AP.

    This issue could only partially be mitigated.

CVE-2019-11555

    The EAP-pwd implementation did't properly validate fragmentation
    reassembly state when receiving an unexpected fragment. This could
    have lead to a process crash due to a NULL pointer derefrence.

    An attacker in radio range of a station or access point with EAP-pwd
    support could cause a crash of the relevant process (wpa_supplicant
    or hostapd), ensuring a denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.3-1+deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.

following sections, please visit .
I. Background
Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) is a security protocol developed by the
Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks.
hostapd(8) and wpa\_supplicant(8) are implementations of user space daemon for
access points and wireless client that implements the WPA2 protocol.
II. Problem Description
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the hostapd(8) and wpa\_supplicant(8)
implementations. For more details, please see the reference URLs in the
References section below.
III. Impact
Security of the wireless network may be compromised. For more details,
please see the reference URLS in the References section below.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not using hostapd(8) or
wpa\_supplicant(8) are not affected.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
Afterwards, restart hostapd(8) or wpa\_supplicant(8).

# CVE-2019-9498

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9497.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9499.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9498 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9498)

#### Description

The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server, when built against a crypto library missing explicit validation on imported elements, do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. An attacker may be able to use invalid scalar/element values to complete authentication, gaining session key and network access without needing or learning the password. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa\_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa\_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.

please see the reference URLS in the References section below.

IV.  Workaround

No workaround is available, but systems not using hostapd(8) or
wpa_supplicant(8) are not affected.

V.   Solution

Perform one of the following:

1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.

Afterwards, restart hostapd(8) or wpa_supplicant(8).

2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:

Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:

# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

Afterwards, restart hostapd(8) or wpa_supplicant(8).

3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:

The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.

# CVE-2019-9495

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9494.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9496.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9495 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9495)

#### Description

The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd and wpa\_supplicant are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. All versions of hostapd and wpa\_supplicant with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The ability to install and execute applications is necessary for a successful attack. Memory access patterns are visible in a shared cache. Weak passwords may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa\_supplicant 2.7 and newer, are not vulnerable to the timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa\_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1699164#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-12 00:04:09 UTC  ``` A reflection attack is possible against the EAP-pwd server since the hostapd EAP server did not verify that the EAP-pwd-Commit contains scalar/element values that differ from the ones the server sent out itself. This allows the attacker to complete EAP-pwd authentication without knowing the password, but this does not result in the attacker being able to derive the session key (MSK), i.e., the attacker would not be able to complete the following key exchange (e.g., 4-way handshake in RSN/WPA).   References: <https://wpa3.mathyvanhoef.com/> <https://w1.fi/security/2019-4/eap-pwd-missing-commit-validation.txt>  Upstream Patch: <https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=d63edfa90243e9a7de6ae5c275032f2cc79fef95>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1699164#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-12 00:04:30 UTC  ``` Created hostapd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1699166](show_bug.cgi?id=1699166 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9497 hostapd: wpa_supplicant: EAP-pwd server not checking for reflection attack [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1699165](show_bug.cgi?id=1699165 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9497 hostapd: wpa_supplicant: EAP-pwd server not checking for reflection attack [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1699164#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-12 14:46:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 as they did not include support for EAP-pwd.  This issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they are not compiled with EAP-pwd enabled. In particular, the CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y option is not set at compile time.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1699164#c5)  Laura Pardo    2019-04-12 20:32:11 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Mathy Vanhoef (NYUAD), Eyal Ronen (Tel Aviv University & KU Leuven)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1699164#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-04-15 08:11:41 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://w1.fi/security/2019-4/eap-pwd-missing-commit-validation.txt> <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/871675/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1699164#c9)  Fedora Update System    2019-04-23 18:49:19 UTC  ``` hostapd-2.7-2.fc28 has been pushed to the Fedora 28 stable repository.

# CVE-2019-9494

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9475.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9495.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9494 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9494)

#### Description

The implementations of SAE in hostapd and wpa\_supplicant are vulnerable to side channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side channel attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa\_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.
