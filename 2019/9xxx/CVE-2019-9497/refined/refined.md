  "CVE-2019-9497": {
    "description": "The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server and wpa_supplicant EAP Peer do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, unless the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will not be able to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The EAP-PWD implementations in both hostapd (EAP Server) and wpa_supplicant (EAP Peer) lack proper validation of scalar and element values within EAP-pwd-Commit messages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing validation of scalar/element values in EAP-pwd-Commit messages"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker might successfully complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, if additional crypto library checks for the EC point are present the session key derivation and key exchange would fail.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to be within radio range to interact with vulnerable hostapd/wpa_supplicant instances using EAP-pwd",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted EAP-pwd messages to the vulnerable server or peer. Additionally, the crypto library must not have additional validations on the EC point or the attack won't complete."
