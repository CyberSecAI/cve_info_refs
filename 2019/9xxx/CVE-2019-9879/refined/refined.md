Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-9879, as detailed in the pentestpartners.com article and the provided exploit code:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper authorization and access controls within the WPGraphQL plugin (versions 0.2.3 and prior). The plugin does not check user privileges before serving responses to GraphQL queries, leading to several unauthorized actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted User Registration with Admin Privileges:**
    *   Vulnerability: The `registerUser` mutation allows specifying the user's role during registration, including 'administrator.'
    *   Weakness: Lack of authorization check on the `registerUser` mutation.
*   **Bypassing Comment Restrictions:**
    *   Vulnerability: The `createComment` mutation allows posting comments even when global moderation is enabled, or if comments are disallowed on a specific article, page or post.
    *   Weakness: Inadequate access controls on the `createComment` mutation.
*   **Disclosure of Password-Protected Content:**
    *   Vulnerability: GraphQL queries can retrieve content from password-protected posts/articles/pages without requiring the password.
    *   Weakness:  Lack of proper access controls when querying password-protected content.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Vulnerability: The plugin exposes sensitive information such as lists of users, media files, installed plugins, and themes without authorization.
    *   Weakness: Insufficient access controls for queries retrieving user lists, media, plugins and themes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Site Takeover:** Creation of an admin user allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by injecting malicious PHP code into the WordPress site.
*   **Content Manipulation:** Attackers can post unauthorized comments, potentially used to deface a site, spread malware, or other malicious purposes.
*   **Confidential Data Exposure:** Attackers can read the content of password-protected posts and pages and can obtain sensitive information like user details and media files.
*   **General Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain insight into the system by retrieving lists of installed plugins and themes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **GraphQL API Endpoint:** The primary attack vector is the GraphQL API endpoint exposed by the WPGraphQL plugin.
*   **Direct GraphQL Queries:** Attackers exploit the vulnerabilities by crafting specific GraphQL queries and mutations to bypass access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site hosting the vulnerable WPGraphQL plugin.
*   **Knowledge of GraphQL:** The attacker must understand how to construct GraphQL queries and mutations.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Most of these vulnerabilities can be exploited without prior authentication, although creating an admin account requires that registrations are open in the wordpress configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code (`wp-graphql0.2.3_exploit.py`) demonstrates these vulnerabilities in action, showing how to register an admin user, post comments, and retrieve password-protected content via GraphQL queries.
*   The vulnerabilities were addressed in WPGraphQL version 0.3.0, which includes a model layer to centralize access checks and data loaders to optimize performance and implement security measures.

In summary, CVE-2019-9879 is caused by insufficient access controls in the WPGraphQL plugin which leads to multiple vulnerabilities like privilege escalation, content and information disclosure, and unauthorized content creation.
