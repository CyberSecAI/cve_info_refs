# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

# Digital Identity and Security

* More

Businesses and governments rely on Thales to bring trust to the billions of digital interactions they have with people.

Our identity management and data protection technologies help banks exchange funds; people cross borders, energy become smarter and much more.

More than 30,000 organisations already rely on Thales solutions to verify the identities of people and things, grant access to digital services, analyse vast quantities of information and encrypt data.

In early 2019, we acquired the international security company **Gemalto** and combined it with our existing digital assets to create a new leader in digital security. Every organisation around the world is in the midst of a digital transformation and stands to benefit from our joint innovations.

As the world becomes more connected, Thales makes it more secure.

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch and users of this product are urged to
upgrade to the latest version available.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is
highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security
issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The DS3 Authentication Server is prone to several security issues as described
below that when combined, allows a low-privileged application user to upload a
JSP web shell with the access rights of the lower privileged Linux system
user "asadmin".

The CVSSv3 scores have been provided by the vendor.

1) Semi-Blind OS Command Injection (Post-authenticated)
- CVE-2019-9156
- CWE-78
- CVSSv3: 6.8 (Medium)

<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L>
The DS3 Authentication Server provides several administration tools to perform
connectivity checks. "TestTelnetConnection.jsp" does not correctly validate the
user input for the "HOST_NAME" and "PORT_NUMBER" parameters, allowing an
attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server side with the privileges
of the local system user "asadmin".

2) Limited Local File Disclosure (LFD) (Post-authenticated)
- CVE-2019-9157
- CWE-538
- CVSSv3: 5.7 (Medium)

<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N>
The DS3 Authentication Server provides several administration tools to check the
system's access and error logs. "TailLogs.jsp" does not correctly validate the
user input for the "LOG_TYPE" parameter, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary
local files with the privileges of the local system user "asadmin".

3) Broken Access Control (Post-authenticated)
- CVE-2019-9158
- CWE-284
- CVSSv3: 5.7 (Medium)

<https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N>
The DS3 Authentication Server provides several permission groups, granting different
levels of privileges, from the administrative "dsssAdmin" group to the low
privileged "READ_ONLY" group. A user with the "dsssAdmin" group can see more
functions in the menu of the web portal than a user with the "READ_ONLY" group.
However, the user with the "READ_ONLY" group can access some "dsssAdmin"
functions by replaying the POST or GET request directly.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Semi-Blind OS Command Injection (Post-authenticated) (CVE-2019-9156)

This POC was performed using a user with the "READ_ONLY" group permission.

This exploit also has the following two restrictions:
1) The bash commands injected cannot contain any space (' '/%20).
2) The output of the bash commands injected must be null or cannot contain any
space (' '/%20). However, the tester was able to create complex bash commands
payload without any space (' '/%20) by using a bash trick.

The simple OS command payload "whoami" injected into the "HOST_NAME"
parameter and the HTTP response with the result of the payload
"asadmin" mixed in. Please note that the OS command payload is enclosed
with the `` characters.

2) Limited Local File Disclosure (LFD) (Post-authenticated) (CVE-2019-9157)

This POC was performed using an admin user with the "dsssAdmin" group
permission, as the "ADMINISTRATION -> Log Manager -> View Log -> Tail Logs
Utility" function is not accessible to users with the "READ_ONLY" group
permission.

This exploit has the following two restrictions:
1) Only the last 10 lines of the file are displayed.
2) Directory traversal was not allowed, as the parameter cannot contain two
dot (.) characters.

However, the tester was able to bypass the directory traversal restriction by
injecting the arbitrary filename as another argument, rather than to modify
the first argument.

The file "/etc/passwd" injected into the "LOG_TYPE" parameter and the response
with the last 10 lines of the file returned. Please note that the injected
filename is preceded with the + character.

3) Broken Access Control (Post-authenticated) (CVE-2019-9158)

The admin user with the "dsssAdmin" group permission is able to access the
following chain of functions in the menu of the web portal.
* ADMINISTRATION -> Log Manager -> View Log
* ADMINISTRATION -> Log Manager -> View Log -> Tail Logs Utility

The user with the "READ_ONLY" group permission is not able to access the
following chain of function in the menu of the web portal.
* ADMINISTRATION -> Log Manager -> View Log

Based on the web portal, a user with the "READ_ONLY" group permission should
also not be able to access the following chain of function.
* ADMINISTRATION -> Log Manager -> View Log -> Tail Logs Utility

However, it was noted that a user with the "READ_ONLY" group permission is able
to access the "Tail Logs Utility" function with the GET request (captured from
the "dsssAdmin" user's request) directly with the "READ_ONLY" user's session
cookie and CSRFTOKEN token.

<https://$IP/ServerAdmin/TailLogs.jsp?LOG_TYPE=audit.log&KEYWORD_FILTER=&REFRESH_RATE=5&TAIL_LINE=392154&CSRFTOKEN=><csrf_token>
