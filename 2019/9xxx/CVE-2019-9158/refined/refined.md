Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-9158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **broken access control** issue within the Gemalto (now Thales Group) DS3 Authentication Server / Ezio Server. Specifically, the application does not properly enforce access controls, allowing lower-privileged users to access functionality intended for higher-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control (CWE-284):**  The application fails to adequately restrict access to certain administrative functions based on user roles. A user with the "READ_ONLY" permission group can bypass the intended access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Administrative Functions:** A low-privileged user (specifically in the "READ_ONLY" group) can access administrative functionalities, such as the "Tail Logs Utility," which should only be available to users in the "dsssAdmin" group.
*   **Potential Data Exposure:**  While the provided description doesn't explicitly state data exposure in the context of the access control bypass, it is possible that by accessing these admin features, an attacker could gain visibility into sensitive data (system logs, configurations, etc) depending on the functionality of the accessed administrative tools, particularly when combined with CVE-2019-9157.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request Replay:** An attacker can access the restricted administrative functionality by replaying a GET request, originally captured from an administrator, but using the lower-privileged user's session cookie and CSRF token. This indicates a failure in proper session management or authorization checks for the specific function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the DS3 Authentication Server, even one with the low-privileged "READ_ONLY" permission group.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web portal of the DS3 Authentication Server.
*   **CSRF Token**: The attacker must have a valid CSRF Token from an authenticated session

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was found by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab on 2019-02-11.
* The vulnerability is present in all versions of Ezio DS3 server earlier than v3.1.0
