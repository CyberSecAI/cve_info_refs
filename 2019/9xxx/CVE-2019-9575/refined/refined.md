Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9575:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2019-9575` and states that the `Quiz And Survey Master WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS`.  This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is the lack of proper encoding of the `quiz_id` parameter when it is used within the plugin's admin interface. Specifically, the plugin takes the `quiz_id` parameter from the URL and directly inserts it into an HTML input field without any sanitization or encoding.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means the malicious script is injected through the request and immediately reflected back to the user.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session when they access a vulnerable page. This can lead to:
     - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies or session tokens to impersonate the victim.
     - **CSRF Bypass:** Performing actions on behalf of the victim without their consent by bypassing Cross-Site Request Forgery protection mechanisms.
     - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data that the user has access to, such as admin credentials or quiz results.
     - **Website Defacement:** Altering the appearance or behavior of the website for the victim.
     - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code within the `quiz_id` parameter. For example:
      ```
      http://<site>/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mlw_quiz_results&quiz_id='"><img+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert(1)>
      ```

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to click the crafted malicious link. This can be achieved through various methods:
     - **Social engineering:** Sending phishing emails or messages with the malicious link.
     - **Website injection:** Posting the link on a website, forum, or blog that the victim is likely to visit.
     - **Advertisement or Ad injection**: Redirect to malicious url

   - **Attacker Capability:**
     - The attacker does not need any special access to the target system.
     - The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to craft malicious JavaScript and URLs.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `quiz-master-next/php/admin/admin-results-page.php`:
  ```php
  <input type="hidden" name="quiz_id" value="<?php echo $_GET["quiz_id"]; ?>" />
  ```
- This code directly echoes the value of the `quiz_id` parameter from the URL into an HTML input tag, without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is in version 6.0.4 of the plugin.
- There was no fix available at the time of the disclosure.
- The vendor was contacted on 10/25/2018, but there was no response.

In summary, CVE-2019-9575 describes a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Quiz and Survey Master WordPress plugin, stemming from a lack of sanitization of the `quiz_id` parameter. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser, potentially leading to severe consequences like session hijacking and data theft.
