Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-9849:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content directly mentions `CVE-2019-9849` in relation to LibreOffice in multiple sources. This includes security advisories from Fedora, Gentoo, and openSUSE, as well as the official LibreOffice website. The descriptions consistently mention a flaw regarding "remote bullet graphics retrieved in 'stealth mode'", which matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is that LibreOffice's "stealth mode," intended to block remote resources from being loaded, didn't apply to bullet graphics. This allowed remote resources to be retrieved even when the user expected them to be blocked.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Insufficient protection in stealth mode:** The vulnerability lies in the incomplete implementation of stealth mode, which failed to prevent the loading of remote bullet graphics.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Information Disclosure:**  Although not explicitly stated in the official CVE description, the extracted content, particularly from the LibreOffice site, explains that the primary risk was that "bullet graphics could be retrieved from remote locations when running in stealth mode". This indicates potential unauthorized access or knowledge of remote resource locations. 

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Document Opening:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document containing remote references to bullet graphics. 

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Ability to craft malicious documents:** An attacker needs to be capable of creating a document with specific remote resources in bullet formats.
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to entice the user to open the malicious document.

**Additional Details from the Content (beyond the basic CVE Description):**
   - **Stealth Mode Description:** The LibreOffice website explains that stealth mode is a user-enabled setting designed to prevent remote resources from loading. This provides additional context for the purpose of the vulnerable feature.
   - **Discovery Credit:** The LibreOffice website credits Matei "Mal" Badanoiu for discovering and reporting the issue.
   - **Resolution:** The vulnerability was fixed in LibreOffice version 6.2.5.
   - **Severity:**  Gentoo classifies this as a high-severity vulnerability, while SUSE rates it as having low severity. This discrepancy highlights that different vendors might assess the same issue with different severities.
   - **Affected Packages:** Specific package versions for various Linux distributions are listed as affected, which allows for pinpointing the vulnerable software.
   - **Exploitable:** Gentoo mentions that it's exploitable both locally and remotely, further clarifying the potential attack scenarios.
   - **CVSS Scores**: There are varying CVSS scores from National Vulnerability Database, SUSE.
