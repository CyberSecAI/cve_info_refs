{
  "CVE-2019-9801": {
    "Description": "Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a \"URL Handler\" in the Windows registry.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in Firefox's acceptance of any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler, without verifying if the program is explicitly registered as a \"URL Handler\" in the Windows registry.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of protocol handlers.",
      "Lack of sufficient checks on Windows registry entries."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious website could trick a user into launching an arbitrary local application, leading to potential security risks. This can be used for social engineering attacks by launching programs that are not intended to handle URL protocols, potentially giving the attacker a way to execute code on the user's system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious website that uses a custom URL scheme to trigger the vulnerable behavior.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a website visited by the target user and knowledge of an application with a registered ProgID on the target's system that is not a URL handler."
