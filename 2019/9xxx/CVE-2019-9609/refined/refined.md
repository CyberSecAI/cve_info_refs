{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `editUploadImage` method of `ComnController.java` which does not properly validate uploaded files. Although there's a check to prevent `.jsp` and `.jspx` extensions, this check can be bypassed using techniques like truncation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unrestricted file upload vulnerability due to insufficient validation of uploaded file names and content type. The file extension check can be easily bypassed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload arbitrary malicious files (e.g., JSP web shells) to the server, potentially gaining remote code execution and full control of the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious file and uploading it through the `editUploadImage` endpoint, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the OFCMS admin panel and upload files, or have the ability to send a specially crafted POST request. They also need to be aware of truncation techniques to bypass the filename check."
