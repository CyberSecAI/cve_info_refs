Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9734:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2019-9734. This is confirmed by:

   - The GitHub advisory explicitly mentions "CVE-2019-9734"
   - The tryption.ch blog post title and content references "CVE-2019-9734"
   - The GitHub commit message directly references "Fix CVE-2019-9734"

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **incorrect if/else usage in the Log-File writer component** of the Aquarius CMS.
*   Due to this flaw, the system writes **POST and GET parameters, including usernames and passwords**, to the log file when debugging is enabled.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information like usernames and passwords are being written to a log file, potentially exposing them to unauthorized users.
*   **Insecure Logging:** The system logs sensitive data, even when it's not an error, due to a flawed conditional statement,
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Filtering**: No filtering or sanitization of user provided input is done, allowing sensitive parameters to be logged in plain text.
*   **Debugging Enabled in Production**: The debugging function was enabled by default.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Exposure**: Attackers can gain access to user credentials (usernames and passwords) by accessing the log file.
*   **Account Takeover:** The obtained credentials can be used to log in to the backend administrative panel, potentially leading to full control of the CMS.
*  **Loss of Confidentiality:** Sensitive data, such as contact form information or order details, could be exposed.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access**: The log file must be accessible to be exploited.
*   **Local Access or Server Compromise:** An attacker needs access to the server's file system where the log file is stored or they may have to compromise the web server hosting the CMS.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Log File**:  The attacker needs to gain access to the server's file system to read the log file
*  **Knowledge of Log File Location**: The location of the log file needs to be known.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability does not require any interaction with the victim or user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The GitHub commit message indicates a fix has been implemented, addressing the incorrect logic in the `lib/log.php` file, but does not provide specific details.
*   The tryption.ch blog provides the location of the log file as  `_MAIN_DIR/_aquarius/cache/log.txt`.
*  The GitHub advisory also notes that the vulnerability is "configuration dependent", meaning that not all instances of Aquarius CMS are vulnerable, depending on settings.
*  The issue was discovered on March 1, 2019, and a fix was released via a GitHub pull request ([https://github.com/aquaverde/aquarius-core/pull/12](https://github.com/aquaverde/aquarius-core/pull/12)).
