- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Uncontrolled memory allocation due to a crafted communication request sent to the CODESYS Gateway component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way the CODESYS Gateway handles communication requests, allowing a malicious request to trigger excessive memory allocation. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the affected CODESYS products unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted communication request to the CODESYS Gateway.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the CODESYS Gateway. They require low skill level to exploit this vulnerability.
