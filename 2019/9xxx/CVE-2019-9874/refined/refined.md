Relevant to CVE-2019-9874.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The CSRF protection in Sitecore deserializes the `__CSRFTOKEN` parameter without proper checks, allowing for manipulation of the serialized object and creation of arbitrary .NET objects. Due to the `ObjectStateFormatter` class being instantiated without parameters, its `_page` attribute is null, bypassing cryptographic signature checks during deserialization.

Weakness:
Unsafe object deserialization, lack of cryptographic signature verification during deserialization.

Impact of exploitation:
Arbitrary command execution on the server. The attacker can execute arbitrary commands and access the underlying file system. Impact depends on the privileges of the service account used.

Attack vector:
Crafted POST request to `/sitecore/shell/Applications/Security/CreateNewUser/CreateNewUser.aspx` with a malicious serialized object in the `__CSRFTOKEN` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
For Sitecore versions 8.x, no authentication is required. For versions 9.x < 9.1.1, authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
