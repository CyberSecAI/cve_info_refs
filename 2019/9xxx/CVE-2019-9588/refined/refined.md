- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Invalid memory access in the `gAtomicIncrement()` function within `GMutex.h`. This occurs due to a race condition or incorrect handling of memory access when incrementing a counter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119), potentially leading to a race condition or invalid memory access in a multithreaded environment.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (segmentation fault), and possibly other unspecified impacts.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted PDF file to the `pdftops` binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to supply a malicious PDF to be processed by a vulnerable version of xpdf.
