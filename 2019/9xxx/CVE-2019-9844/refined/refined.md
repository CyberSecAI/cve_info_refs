Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9844:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue that stems from the `simple-markdown` library's improper handling of `data:` and `vbscript:` URIs within links. Specifically, the library failed to sanitize these URIs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `simple-markdown` library did not properly sanitize or validate the URLs provided in markdown links. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious code through the `data:` and `vbscript:` URI schemes.
- **XSS Vulnerability:** By crafting malicious links using `data:` URIs (e.g., `data:text/html;base64,<script>alert('hi')</script>`), an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Data Theft:** By executing malicious JavaScript, the attacker could steal sensitive user information like cookies or session tokens.
- **Session Hijacking:** With stolen cookies/session tokens, attackers can impersonate the victim and take over their accounts on the affected application.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker might alter the content of the page.
- **Malware Distribution:** An attacker might inject malicious scripts that redirect users to pages hosting malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Markdown Links:** The primary attack vector is through crafting malicious markdown links containing `data:` or `vbscript:` URIs.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to view a page containing the maliciously crafted markdown.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers could use social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Markdown:** The attacker must be able to inject markdown content that is processed by the vulnerable `simple-markdown` library. This can be achieved through various means like:
    - Posting comments or messages containing malicious links on a web application
    - Submitting user-controlled content that utilizes the `simple-markdown` library.
- **Understanding of Markdown Syntax:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of markdown to inject malicious links.

**Additional Details from Content**
- The vulnerability was reported by `jedixak` and fixed in version `0.4.4`.
- The fix was implemented by sanitizing the URL and removing the ability to execute script via data or vbscript URIs.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in Fedora 28, 29 and 30.
- The vulnerability was also addressed in `markdown-to-jsx`.
-  The vulnerable code allows to execute arbitrary javascript by using a `data:` URL containing javascript code.
-  The `javascript:` protocol was also mentioned as a potential vector which requires sanitization
