Here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding the crash in XnView described as CVE-2019-9965:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated but the provided crash logs point to memory corruption vulnerabilities during image processing due to invalid or unexpected data handled by the software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write (as suggested by the `movdqa` instruction writing to memory locations pointed by `edi`, which are probably out-of-bounds)
- Memory corruption (as shown by crashes in `ntdll!RtlFreeHeap` and `ntdll!RtlReAllocateHeap`)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash/denial of service.
- Possible arbitrary code execution (While not explicitly confirmed, memory corruption vulnerabilities could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution).

**Attack vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted image file in XnView.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image file to the XnView application. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening the malicious file.
