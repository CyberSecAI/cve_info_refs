## CVE-2019-9495 Analysis

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Description:** This CVE concerns a cache side-channel attack vulnerability in the EAP-PWD (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Password) implementations of `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`.

**Root Cause:** The EAP-PWD implementations are vulnerable to side-channel attacks due to cache access patterns during password element derivation. This means that an attacker can potentially observe the memory access patterns of the system to infer information about the password.

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Cache Side-Channel:** Vulnerable implementations have conditional branches based on secret values during the "hunting and pecking" algorithm used for password generation, leading to cache access patterns that can leak information about the password.

**Impact:** An attacker who can run unprivileged code on the same system as the vulnerable software (or potentially in a co-located virtual machine) can exploit this side-channel vulnerability to recover the password using an offline dictionary attack, if the password is weak.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Local Access Required:** The attack requires the ability to execute code on the same system where `hostapd` or `wpa_supplicant` is running (or possibly a co-located virtual machine), because the attacker needs to be able to observe the shared cache.
*   **EAP-pwd:** The system must be using EAP-pwd for authentication.

**Affected Software:** All versions of `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant` with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable, particularly those prior to version 2.7.

**Mitigation:**
*   Implement defenses against cache-based attacks.  Replace conditional branches that depend on secret values with constant-time select utilities.
*   Use a constant-time Legendre symbol computation.
*   Always perform a fixed number of iterations in the password generation algorithm.
*   Update to the latest versions of `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`.

**SUSE details:**

*   SUSE rates this issue as "moderate" severity.
*   The CVSS v3 score is listed as 6.4 (AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L), reflecting an Adjacent Network attack vector.
*   Fixed package versions are provided for various SUSE products.

**Red Hat details:**

*   Red Hat states that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are not affected because they either do not include EAP-pwd support or are not compiled with EAP-pwd enabled.

**Synology Details:**

*   Synology identifies this vulnerability as affecting RADIUS Server 3.0, and advises users to upgrade to DSM 6.2.3-25426 or above.

**FreeBSD Details:**

*   FreeBSD provides patches to address this and other related vulnerabilities in hostapd and wpa\_supplicant.

**Fedora Details:**

*   Fedora provides updated hostapd packages to address the vulnerability.
