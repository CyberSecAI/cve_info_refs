{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an out-of-memory condition in the objalloc.c library within GNU Binutils. Specifically, when processing crafted binary files, tools like objdump and size can attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory, leading to an allocation failure and denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Out-of-memory error",
	    "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting available memory resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local File Processing"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute vulnerable Binutils tools (like objdump, size, or potentially others) against a crafted malicious binary file. This could be achieved locally if the attacker has access to the system, or remotely if a service processes user-supplied binaries using a vulnerable Binutils version."
  },
    "affected_products":[
        "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node",
         "sys-devel/binutils"
        ],
  "additional_notes": "The provided bug reports show that similar out-of-memory conditions can occur in tools like `size` due to the same underlying issue in the shared `objalloc.c` library. The bug was not deemed a high priority since it can be triggered with user-provided input, and it was determined to be a \"wontfix\" by upstream maintainers. The provided NetApp advisory clarifies the vulnerability's potential to cause information disclosure, data modification, or DoS, although the bug reports specifically highlight DoS due to memory exhaustion."
