Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-9818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A race condition exists within the crash generation server on Windows. This server is responsible for collecting crash data.
*   The race occurs in the `CrashGenerationServer::AddClient` function when registering a client process.
*   The function registers a callback (`OnClientEnd`) to be triggered when the client process terminates.
*   The `OnClientEnd` callback frees the `ClientInfo` object, which stores information about the client process.
*   However, the `client_info->set_process_exit_wait_handle(process_wait_handle)` line within `AddClient` might be executed after `client_info` has been freed by the `OnClientEnd` callback, leading to use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where memory is accessed after it has been deallocated.
*   **Race Condition:**  The vulnerability relies on a race condition between the registration of the client and the termination of the client process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The use-after-free can lead to a crash in the main Firefox process.
*  **Sandbox Escape:** By carefully crafting the heap layout, an attacker can leverage this UAF to gain arbitrary write primitive in the broker process, corrupting a field (size/flags) in an exploitable object. This can be used to escape the sandbox.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):**  The vulnerability allows an attacker with code execution within a sandboxed process to potentially gain code execution in the main Firefox process, achieving a local privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack requires code execution within a sandboxed renderer process.
*   The sandboxed process then interacts with the crash generation server through a named pipe.
*   The attacker needs to trigger the race condition by registering a client and quickly terminating the client, or by registering and then terminating another process.
*   The server doesn't validate if the client is already registered and if its PID matches the caller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Execution:** The attacker must have achieved code execution within a sandboxed process, such as a renderer process in Firefox.
*  **Windows Target:** This vulnerability only affects Windows, it is not present in other operating systems.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by an update to the Breakpad library.
*   The fix involves blocking child process termination until the handler is fully initialized, preventing the UAF.
