{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The API endpoint for retrieving board lists was not properly enforcing access controls, leading to information disclosure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), Information Disclosure",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could retrieve sensitive information about restricted internal projects, including details about lists, labels, milestones, and associated users, even without being a project member.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the API endpoint `/boards/[Board_ID]/lists`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a valid GitLab user, but does not need to be a member of the target project. They would need to know the project's board ID to exploit the vulnerability."
