[`e3e35a8`](/spdk/spdk/commit/e3e35a85ea69dc101507b9ff9838074c55fc7a40)

# ocf bdev

New virtual bdev module based on [Open CAS Framework](https://open-cas.github.io/) has been added.

This module allows for the use of one bdev to act as a high performance cache in front of another bdev.

Please see [documentation](https://spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#bdev_config_cas) for more details.

Only write through mode is currently supported and this feature is considered experimental.

# event framework

For `spdk_app_parse_args`, add return value to the callback which parses application

specific command line parameters to protect SPDK applications from crashing by invalid

values from user input.

By default, all SPDK applications will now reserve all hugepages at runtime. The pre-reserved

memory size can be still set with `-s` or `--mem-size` option, although the default value

was reduced down to 0.

A custom hugetlbfs directory can now be specified via spdk\_app\_opts.

This can be used to configure hugepages with different sizes, a different size limit,

or different access permissions than the system's default hugepage pool.

SPDK applications can specify a custom hugetlbfs mount with the `--huge-dir` option.

# environment

spdk\_vtophys() has been refactored to accept length of the translated region as a new

parameter. The function will now update that parameter with the largest possible value

for which the memory is contiguous in the physical memory address space.

The following functions were removed:

* spdk\_pci\_nvme\_device\_attach()
* spdk\_pci\_nvme\_enumerate()
* spdk\_pci\_ioat\_device\_attach()
* spdk\_pci\_ioat\_enumerate()
* spdk\_pci\_virtio\_device\_attach()
* spdk\_pci\_virtio\_enumerate()

They were replaced with generic spdk\_pci\_device\_attach() and spdk\_pci\_enumerate() which

require a new spdk\_pci\_driver object to be provided. It can be one of the following:

* spdk\_pci\_nvme\_get\_driver()
* spdk\_pci\_ioat\_get\_driver()
* spdk\_pci\_virtio\_get\_driver()

spdk\_pci\_hook\_device() and spdk\_pci\_unhook\_device() were added. Those allow adding a virtual

spdk\_pci\_device into the SPDK PCI subsystem. A virtual device calls provided callbacks for

each BAR mapping request or PCI config access. It's attachable with spdk\_pci\_device\_attach()

or spdk\_pci\_enumerate() like any other device.

A new spdk\_pause() function was added to pause CPU execution for an implementation specific

amount of time. Quoting from DPDK function this is based on: "This call is intended for

tight loops which poll a shared resource or wait for an event. A short pause within the loop

may reduce the power consumption."

A new public header file env\_dpdk.h has been introduced, and function spdk\_env\_dpdk\_post\_init

is added into it. If user is using DPDK, and already called rte\_eal\_init, then include

include/spdk/env\_dpdk.h, and call spdk\_env\_dpdk\_post\_init() instead of spdk\_env\_init.

ISA-L has been added as an SPDK submodule. ISA-L is enabled by default on x86 architecture

to accelerate algorithms such as CRC for iSCSI and NVMe-oF. Users may still disable ISA-L

by explicitly passing --without-isal to the configure script.

# util

A new uuid API `spdk_uuid_copy` was added to make a copy of the source uuid.

An new parameter `init_crc` representing the initial CRC value was added to

`spdk_crc16_t10dif`. The parameter can be used to calculate a CRC value spanning

multiple separate buffers.

New DIF APIs were added to generate and verify DIF by byte granularity for both DIF and DIX

formats. Among them, DIF with copy APIs will be usable to emulate DIF operations such as DIF

insert and strip.

Added `spdk_strtol` and `spdk_strtoll` to provide additional error checking around `strtol`

and `strtoll`.

Added `spdk_sprintf_append_realloc` and `spdk_vsprintf_append_realloc` for appending a string

with automatic buffer re-allocation.

# nvme

Wrapper functions spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_security\_send() and spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_security\_receive() are

introduced to support further security protocol development.

admin\_timeout\_ms was added to NVMe controller initialization options, users

can change the default value when probing a controller.

Add two new fields "header\_digest" and "data\_digest" in struct spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_opts,

it will be used to enable the digest support for the NVMe/TCP transport.

Add a new TCP/IP transport(located in lib/nvme/nvme\_tcp.c) in nvme driver. With

this new transport, it can be used to connect the NVMe-oF target with the

same TCP/IP support.

Added API, spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_is\_discovery(), to indicate whether the ctrlr

arg refers to a Discovery Controller or not.

Added an API function `spdk_nvme_host_id_parse` and corresponding object `spdk_nvme_host_id`

for parsing host address and host service ID arguments on a per connection basis.

The RPC `construct_nvme_bdev` now allows a user to specify a source address and service id for the host to

use when connecting to the controller backing the NVMe bdev.

# NVMe-oF Target

The `spdk_nvmf_tgt_opts` struct has been deprecated in favor of `spdk_nvmf_transport_opts`.

Users will no longer be able to specify target wide I/O parameters. `spdk_nvmf_tgt_listen`

will also no longer implicitly initialize a transport with the default target options (since

there are none). Instead, a user must manually instantiate the transport with `spdk_nvmf_transport_create`

prior to calling `spdk_nvmf_tgt_listen`.

Related to the previous change, the rpc `set_nvmf_target_options` has been renamed to

`set_nvmf_target_max_subsystems` to indicate that this is the only target option available for the user to edit.

Added fields `num_shared_buffers` and `buf_cache_size` in struct spdk\_nvmf\_transport\_opts,

and also updated the related rpc function nvmf\_create\_transport, to make this

configurable parameter available to users. The `num_shared_buffers` is used to

configure the shared buffer numbers of the transport used by RDMA or TCP transport.

`buf_cache_size` configures number of shared buffers to cache per poll group.

# nvmf

Add a new TCP/IP transport (located in lib/nvmf/tcp.c). With this tranport,

the SPDK NVMe-oF target can have a new transport, and can serve the NVMe-oF

protocol via TCP/IP from the host.

Added optional mechanism to modify the RDMA transport's behavior when creating protection domains and registering memory.

By default, the RDMA transport will use the ibverbs library to create protection domains and register memory.

Using `spdk_nvme_rdma_init_hooks` will subvert that and use an existing registration.

# bdev

Added `enable_bdev_histogram` and `get_bdev_histogram` RPC commands to allow gathering latency data for specified bdev.

Please see [documentation](https://spdk.io/doc/bdev.html#rpc_bdev_histogram) for more details.

Added `required_alignment` field to `spdk_bdev`, that specifies an alignment requirement for data buffers associated with an spdk\_bdev\_io.

Bdev layer will automatically double buffer any spdk\_bdev\_io that violates this alignment, before the spdk\_bdev\_io is submitted to the bdev module.

On shutdown, bdev unregister now proceeds in top-down fashion, with

claimed bdevs skipped (these will be unregistered later, when virtual

bdev built on top of the respective base bdev unclaims it). This

allows virtual bdevs to be shut down cleanly as opposed to the

previous behavior that didn't differentiate between hotremove and

planned shutdown.

The `delete_bdev` RPC is now deprecated. Users should instead use the specific deletion RPC

for the bdev type to be removed (i.e. delete\_malloc\_bdev).

Added support for separate bandwidth rate limits for read and write to QoS in bdev layer.

Bdev I/O statistics now track unmap opertations.

# logical volumes

Logical volume bdev can now be marked as read only using `set_read_only_lvol_bdev` RPC.

This allows for basing clones on top of lvol\_bdev without first creating a snapshot.

Added option to change method for data erasure when deleting lvol or resizing down.

Default of unmapping clusters can now be changed to writing zeroes or no operation.

# log

"trace flags" are now referred to as "log flags" in the SPDK log API. The

set\_trace\_flag, clear\_trace\_flag and get\_trace\_flags RPCs are now deprecated,

and set\_log\_flag, clear\_log\_flag and get\_log\_flags RPCs have been added.

# trace

New `trace_record` application was added. It can be used to poll spdk trace shm file and

append any new trace entries into another specified file. This can help retain those entries

that would otherwise be overwritten in the shm file. See

[Capturing sufficient trace events](https://spdk.io/doc/nvmf_tgt_tracepoints.html#capture_trace_events)

for more details.

Number of trace entries in circular buffer per lcore can now be assigned by starting SPDK app

with argument "--num-trace-entries " provided.

New `get_tpoint_group_mask` RPC was added to get current tpoint\_group\_mask, and

each tpoint group status.

New `enable_tpoint_group` and `disable_tpoint_group` RPC were added to enable or

disable a specific tpoint group.

# ftl

EXPERIMENTAL: Added basic flash translation layer module allowing for using Open Channel SSDs as

block devices. The module is split into the library (located in lib/ftl) and bdev\_ftl

(lib/bdev/ftl). See the [documentation](https://spdk.io/doc/ftl.html) for more details.

# vhost

A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in the SPDK vhost target. A malicious

vhost client (i.e. virtual machine) could carefully construct a circular descriptor chain which

would result in a partial denial of service in the SPDK vhost target. These types of descriptor

chains are now properly detected by the vhost target. All SPDK vhost users serving untrusted

vhost clients are strongly recommended to upgrade. (Reported by Dima Stepanov and Evgeny

Yakovlev.)

Vhost SCSI and Vhost Block devices can now accept multiple connections on the same socket file.

Each connection (internally called a vhost session) will have access to the same storage, but

will use different virtqueues, different features and possibly different memory.

# vhost scsi

SCSI target hotremove can now be performed even without the VIRTIO\_SCSI\_F\_HOTPLUG feature negotiated.

Regardless of VIRTIO\_SCSI\_F\_HOTPLUG support, the hotremoval will be still reported through SCSI sense codes.

# DPDK

DPDK submodule was updated to DPDK 18.11. Note that SPDK does not fully leverage the new

multi-process device hotplug yet and continues to work the same way it always did.

Dropped support for DPDK 16.07 and earlier, which SPDK won't even compile with right now.

# RPC

The following RPC commands deprecated in the previous release are now removed:

* construct\_virtio\_user\_scsi\_bdev
* construct\_virtio\_pci\_scsi\_bdev
* construct\_virtio\_user\_blk\_bdev
* construct\_virtio\_pci\_blk\_bdev
* remove\_virtio\_scsi\_bdev
* construct\_nvmf\_subsystem

# Miscellaneous

The configure options `--with-raid` and `--without-raid` that were deprecated in the previous

release are now removed.

# nbd

Starting nbd using `spdk_nbd_start` is now performed asynchronously.

# net framework

Net framework initialization and finish is now done asynchronously.

# rpc

Added `spdk_rpc_is_method_allowed` function for checking whether method is permitted in a given state.

Added `spdk_rpc_get_state` to check current state of RPC server.

RPC `wait_subsystem_init` has been added to allow clients to block untill all subsystems are initialized.

# json rpc

JSON RPC client is now running in non-blocking mode. Requests are sent and received during spdk\_jsonrpc\_client\_poll.

JSON RPC server can now recieve a callback on connection termination or server shutdown using `spdk_jsonrpc_conn_add_close_cb`

and `spdk_jsonrpc_conn_del_close_cb`.

|  |  |  |
|  |  | A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in the SPDK vhost target. A malicious |
|  |  | vhost client (i.e. virtual machine) could carefully construct a circular descriptor chain which |
|  |  | would result in a partial denial of service in the SPDK vhost target. These types of descriptor |
|  |  | chains are now properly detected by the vhost target. All SPDK vhost users serving untrusted |
|  |  | vhost clients are strongly recommended to upgrade. (Reported by Dima Stepanov and Evgeny |
|  |  | Yakovlev.) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Vhost SCSI and Vhost Block devices can now accept multiple connections on the same socket file. |
|  |  | Each connection (internally called a vhost session) will have access to the same storage, but |
|  |  | will use different virtqueues, different features and possibly different memory. |
