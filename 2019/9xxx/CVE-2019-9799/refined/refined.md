Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2019-9799:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Firefox's `ExternalHelperAppParent` handles inter-process communication (IPC) messages from a content process. Specifically, the `RecvOnDataAvailable` method does not properly validate the `count` parameter it receives from the content process. This `count` parameter, along with an offset, is used when creating a new byte input stream.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Lack of input validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of checks to ensure that the `count` parameter provided by the content process does not exceed the actual length of the data being sent via IPC.
-   **Potential Memory Read:** Specifically, the vulnerable code uses the count parameter from the child process to create a byte input stream. If the content process sends a `count` that is larger than the length of data, then the code can read out of bounds. This leads to the possibility of the parent process reading data beyond the allocated buffer.
-   **Improper use of NS_NewByteInputStream:** The parent process uses `NS_NewByteInputStream` with potentially untrusted length values, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** A compromised content process can exploit this vulnerability to potentially read memory from the parent process.  This memory could contain sensitive information, which would constitute an information leak. The vulnerability is classified as high severity.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Compromised Content Process:** A malicious or compromised content process is required to send a crafted IPC message with an invalid count parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have the capability to compromise a content process. This could be achieved through various vulnerabilities or malicious web content loaded within the browser.
-   The attacker needs to be able to send an IPC message to the parent process, crafting the `count` parameter.
-   The attacker needs to know what the count parameter means in relation to the data to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in multiple locations with similar patterns, the first of which was discovered in the `ExternalHelperAppParent::RecvOnDataAvailable`.
-  The fix involves validating the count parameter against the actual data length before using it in `NS_NewByteInputStream`.
- This vulnerability was addressed as part of a larger fix in Bug 1415508, which also addresses another similar issue.
