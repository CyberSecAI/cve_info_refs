<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/cb7faaf6b4ad2528390186f1ce64618dea71031e/gfx/gl/GLLibraryEGL.h#21>

```
#ifdef ANDROID
// We only need to explicitly dlopen egltrace
// on android as we can use LD_PRELOAD or other tricks
// on other platforms. We look for it in /data/local
// as that's writeable by all users
//
// This should really go in GLLibraryEGL.cpp but we currently reference
// APITRACE_LIB in GLContextProviderEGL.cpp. Further refactoring
// will come in subsequent patches on Bug 732865
#  define APITRACE_LIB "/data/local/tmp/egltrace.so"
#endif

```

We should not be loading libraries from locations that other apps can write to. It sounds like might be the case here.

This should be opt-in, maybe by pref.

sec-high because it'd be pretty easy for a malicious app (evidence of their existence abounds) to completely MITM anything you do in your browser.

Comment on [attachment 9045094](/attachment.cgi?id=9045094 "Bug 1527534 - Reuse LoadApitraceLibrary.") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9045094&action=edit "Bug 1527534 - Reuse LoadApitraceLibrary.")

[Bug 1527534](/show_bug.cgi?id=1527534 "RESOLVED FIXED - On Android, Gecko always tries to load a library from an all-user-writable path APITRACE_LIB") - Reuse LoadApitraceLibrary.

## Security Approval Request

### How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?

Difficult. You have to realize that GLContext's loading of the APITRACE library isn't restricted by the pref, /and also/ have control of a malicious installed app to write a malicious hook library to that location.

Otherwise, this mostly looks like a quality-of-life refactor.

### Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?

No

### Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?

all

### If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?

None

### Do you have backports for the affected branches?

No

### If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?

Trivial

### How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?

Unlikely to regress if tests pass.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

Fixed in

* Firefox 66

#### [#CVE-2019-9790: Use-after-free when removing in-use DOM elements](#CVE-2019-9790)

Reporter
Brandon Wieser
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using JavaScript and the element is then removed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1525145](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525145)

#### [#CVE-2019-9791: Type inference is incorrect for constructors entered through on-stack replacement with IonMonkey](#CVE-2019-9791)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1530958](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530958)

#### [#CVE-2019-9792: IonMonkey leaks JS\_OPTIMIZED\_OUT magic value to script](#CVE-2019-9792)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal `JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT` magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1532599](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532599)

#### [#CVE-2019-9793: Improper bounds checks when Spectre mitigations are disabled](#CVE-2019-9793)

Reporter
Bruno Keith & Niklas Baumstark from the phoenhex team
Impact
high
##### Description

A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range in circumstances where users have explicitly disabled Spectre mitigations.
 *Note: Spectre mitigations are currently enabled for all users by default settings.*

* [Bug 1528829](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829)

#### [#CVE-2019-9794: Command line arguments not discarded during execution](#CVE-2019-9794)

Reporter
Joshua Graham
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1530103](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530103)

#### [#CVE-2019-9795: Type-confusion in IonMonkey JIT compiler](#CVE-2019-9795)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1514682](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1514682)

#### [#CVE-2019-9796: Use-after-free with SMIL animation controller](#CVE-2019-9796)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.

##### References

* [Bug 1531277](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1531277)

#### [#CVE-2019-9797: Cross-origin theft of images with createImageBitmap](#CVE-2019-9797)

Reporter
AaylaSecura1138
Impact
high
##### Description

Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the same-origin policy by exporting an image after using `createImageBitmap` to read the image and then rendering the resulting bitmap image within a `canvas` element.

##### References

* [Bug 1528909](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528909)

#### [#CVE-2019-9798: Library is loaded from world writable APITRACE\_LIB location](#CVE-2019-9798)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert
Impact
high
##### Description

On Android systems, Firefox can load a library from `APITRACE_LIB`, which is writable by all users and applications. This could allow malicious third party applications to execute a man-in-the-middle attack if a malicious code was written to that location and loaded.
 *Note: This issue only affects Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1527534](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527534)

#### [#CVE-2019-9799: Information disclosure via IPC channel messages](#CVE-2019-9799)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
high
##### Description

Insufficient bounds checking of data during inter-process communication might allow a compromised content process to be able to read memory from the parent process under certain conditions.

##### References

* [Bug 1505678](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1505678)

#### [#CVE-2019-9801: Windows programs that are not 'URL Handlers' are exposed to web content](#CVE-2019-9801)

Reporter
Daniel Veditz
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1527717](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527717)

#### [#CVE-2019-9802: Chrome process information leak](#CVE-2019-9802)

Reporter
Stephen Fewer
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download which will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process, which may include sensitive data.

##### References

* [Bug 1415508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1415508)

#### [#CVE-2019-9803: Upgrade-Insecure-Requests incorrectly enforced for same-origin navigation](#CVE-2019-9803)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu, Vinothkumar Nagasayanan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources.

##### References

* [Bug 1515863](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515863)

#### [#CVE-2019-9804: Code execution through 'Copy as cURL' in Firefox Developer Tools on macOS](#CVE-2019-9804)

Reporter
potatoe
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Firefox Developer Tools it is possible that pasting the result of the 'Copy as cURL' command into a command shell on macOS will cause the execution of unintended additional bash script commands if the URL was maliciously crafted. This is the result of an issue with the native version of Bash on macOS.
 *Note: This issue only affects macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1518026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1518026)

Reporter
Hanno Böck, Anca Soncutean
Impact
low
##### Description

A vulnerability exists during authorization prompting for FTP transaction where successive modal prompts are displayed and cannot be immediately dismissed. This allows for a denial of service (DOS) attack.

##### References

* [Bug 1525267](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525267)

#### [#CVE-2019-9807: Text sent through FTP connection can be incorporated into alert messages](#CVE-2019-9807)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

When arbitrary text is sent over an FTP connection and a page reload is initiated, it is possible to create a modal alert message with this text as the content. This could potentially be used for social engineering attacks.

##### References

#### [#CVE-2019-9808: WebRTC permissions can display incorrect origin with data: and blob: URLs](#CVE-2019-9808)

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

If WebRTC permission is requested from documents with data: or blob: URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states "Unknown origin" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.

This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

I've been looking for variants of [bug 1438425](/show_bug.cgi?id=1438425 "RESOLVED FIXED - PDocumentRenderer __delete__() passes a size and a buffer, without length checks"), using static analysis to find similar cases.I wrote Semmle query for parent IPDL handlers which take an nsCString parameter called "data". Mostly these related to remoting various nsiStreamListeners. Overall the architecture concerns me: there seems to be a lot of parameters passed back and forth between parent and child, and there are a lot of paramters which are just taken at face value in the parent. BUT I haven't found a concrete issue yet, so I'm filing this to get other opinions.
Take ExternalHelperAppParent::RecvOnDataAvailable[1] as an example. It receives `nsCString& data`, and also an offset and count from the child. These are passed into:
DebugOnly<nsresult> rv = NS\_NewByteInputStream(getter\_AddRefs(stringStream), data.get(), count, NS\_ASSIGNMENT\_DEPEND);
It's hard to trace, but as far as I can tell, these values end up in nsExternalAppHandler::OnDataAvailable [2], where the stream is written to a temporary file. Now this on it's own isn't too serious - you can maybe stream a bunch of memory into a file. But thats a guess, and if you can then read the file, then we have at least an info leak.
My more general question is: "is it safe to pass untrusted length values to NS\_NewByteInputStream. If the answer is no, then there are half a dozen other places that we need to add checks (Recv\*DataAvailable mostly). And I assume the fix here is just to check that the count < data.length()

This is not related to that bug, that's a boring null-ptr-deref if you call this method before something has been initialized.

From what I can tell this is not safe, and we really should add these checks.Flags: needinfo?(valentin.gosu)

As far as ExternalHelperAppParent::RecvOnDataAvailable is concerned, we don't need to send offset and count args at all. Those can be easily kept track of (offset) and calculated from the string (count).
- offset is the sum of all |count|s before:
OnDataAvailable(offset = 0, count = 100)
OnDataAvailable(offset = 100, count = 50)
OnDataAvailable(offset = 150, count = ...)
etc...
- count is how many bytes \*may\* be available in the input stream, the consumer obligation is to attempt to read this amount of data from the input stream (that's the contract)
so: offset has to be re-calculated in ExternalHelperAppParent, count is data.Length()
and, the offset and toRead we are sending at [1] are both actually sent wrong, when count > kCopyChunkSize - offset is broken, when count < input.Available() - the toRead is smaller than the actual data length we send. we can fix that too with omitting the args completely.

sorry, larger!
then, would be good to assert an assert at [2] that stringStream.available() == 0

Note that there around 5 or so places where use this pattern. I just relised that we already have one of these already on file in 1415508. Need-info'ing myself to file the other instance (or documenting them in this bug, if it looks like the fix proposed in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1505678#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - ExternalHelperAppParent doesn't validate arguments (potential sandbox issue)") will apply to them as well. )Flags: needinfo?(ptheriault)

Just noticed this is related to [bug 1415508](/show_bug.cgi?id=1415508 "RESOLVED FIXED - FTPChannelParent::RecvDivertOnDataAvailable - Chrome Process Info Leak") - that makes me lean even more towards trying beta uplift.

Yeah, I did a beta uplift request on the basis of the fact that it was fixing a whole family of issues.
