  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Darktrace Enterprise Immune System versions 3.0.9 and 3.0.10 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to insufficient protection against unauthorized requests.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability",
      "Lack of proper CSRF protection on /whitelisteddomains endpoint",
      "Lack of proper CSRF protection on /config endpoint"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can manipulate the Darktrace system by whitelisting domains, disabling alerts, and disabling the Antigena component. This could lead to security breaches and prevent the system from detecting threats.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited using a malicious webpage that uses a crafted form to send unauthorized requests to the Darktrace device.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure an authenticated Darktrace user to visit the malicious webpage while they are logged into the Darktrace device. The attacker does not need any prior access to the Darktrace system itself."
