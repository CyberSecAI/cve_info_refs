Vulnerability: CVE-2019-9878
Description: Invalid memory access in GfxIndexedColorSpace::mapColorToBase( ) in pdfalto 0.2
Root cause: The vulnerability exists in the function `GfxIndexedColorSpace::mapColorToBase()` in `GfxState.cc`. The function `GfxState::getFillRGB()` invokes `GfxIndexedColorSpace::getRGB()`, which constructs an indexed color space and then calls `GfxIndexedColorSpace::mapColorToBase()`. A crafted PDF file triggers the vulnerability at the line `baseColor->c[i] = dblToCol(low[i] + (p[i] / 255.0) * range[i])`, where `p` is an unsigned character pointer. The memory access becomes invalid when `p` takes values of `k` and `n`, specifically when `k` equals the high index (maximum pixel value).
Weakness: CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
Impact: Denial of Service (Segmentation fault), potentially unspecified other impacts.
Attack vector: Sending a crafted PDF file to the pdfalto binary.
Required attacker capabilities: Ability to provide a crafted PDF file as input to the pdfalto application.
