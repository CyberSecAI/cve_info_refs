# USN-4336-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

22 April 2020

Several security issues were fixed in GNU binutils.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security

issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to

crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [binutils](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)
* [binutils-multiarch](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils)
  -
  [2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/binutils/2.30-21ubuntu1~18.04.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

1](show_bug.cgi?id=24229#c1)  Nick Clifton    2019-02-18 16:53:26 UTC  ``` Hi spinpx,    Thanks for reporting this bug.  Unfortunately the problem is in the    libiberty library which is maintained by the gcc project, rather than   the binutils project.  So please could you report this bug here:  <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=gcc>  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=24229#c2)  spinpx    2019-02-19 08:25:41 UTC  ``` report on gcc: <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=89395> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=24229#c3)  spinpx    2019-02-19 09:08:00 UTC  ``` It can be reproduced in commit c72e75a64030b0f6535a80481f37968ad55c333a (Feb 19 2019). ``` |  |
