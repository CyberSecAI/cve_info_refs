The provided content is related to CVE-2019-9482.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the sighting settings within the MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) application. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the `SightingsController.php` file, where the code that filters which sightings a user is allowed to view is flawed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code was not correctly checking user permissions for accessing event sightings. Specifically, it failed to properly enforce restrictions on who can view sightings when the settings are configured to restrict access to either "event only" or "sighting reported only" scenarios. A user could potentially view sightings associated with events they should not have access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could view sighting information for events that they are not authorized to see. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive threat intelligence data.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the list of sightings via the `listSightings` function in the `SightingsController.php`. The attacker must have access to the MISP platform and attempt to view the sightings data through the web interface or API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the MISP platform. The attacker needs to navigate to a view where the `listSightings` method is used, and trigger the vulnerability by requesting a listing of sightings for an event where permissions should normally prevent the user from seeing the sighting data.
