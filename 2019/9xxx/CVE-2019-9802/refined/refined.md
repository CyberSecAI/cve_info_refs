Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-9802:

*   **Vulnerability:** Chrome process information leak.
*   **Root Cause:** A compromised content process can initiate an FTP file download. The downloaded data is passed to the Chrome process. An attacker can supply an arbitrary file length, bypassing sandbox protections. This leads to a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when passing data from a content process to the chrome process during FTP downloads. Specifically, the 'count' parameter in `FTPChannelParent::RecvDivertOnDataAvailable` is not properly validated against the actual size of the data buffer. This allows reading beyond the intended buffer.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can leak memory from the Chrome process. This could be used to bypass ASLR or leak sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vector:** A compromised content process initiates an FTP download and manipulates the 'count' parameter in the `SendDivertOnDataAvailable` function call to be larger than the actual data size.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to compromise a content process. They also need to influence the heap layout to leak useful information and prevent crashes.
*   **Affected Component:** `FTPChannelParent::RecvDivertOnDataAvailable`
*   **Affected Platforms:** Unspecified, but the reproduction steps mention Win10.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves cropping the `count` value as `min(count, data.Length())` to prevent reading beyond the data buffer's boundaries.
