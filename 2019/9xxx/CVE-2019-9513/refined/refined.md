Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9513:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2019-9513 lies in the way HTTP/2 implementations handle PRIORITY frames. An attacker can create multiple request streams and continually shuffle the priority of these streams, causing excessive resource consumption by the server. This is due to inefficient handling of the priority tree updates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Resource Loop:** The vulnerability stems from the inefficient processing of priority updates, leading to resource loops. Specifically, the vulnerability causes a large amount of CPU usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to excessive resource consumption on the server, rendering it unable to handle legitimate traffic, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network using HTTP/2 protocol.
*   **Malformed HTTP/2 Frames:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a stream of PRIORITY frames that cause substantial churn to the priority tree.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish an HTTP/2 connection with the targeted server.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP/2 Frames:** The attacker needs the capability to send PRIORITY frames.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2019:2746) indicates that this CVE is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities that were fixed in a single update for rh-nginx112-nginx. This advisory also mentions that CVE-2019-9511 and CVE-2019-9516 are related to this issue.
* The advisory RHSA-2019:2925 shows that nodejs was also vulnerable to this issue.
* The openSUSE mailing list content shows that nginx and nghttp2 were also vulnerable
* Some vendors like Cloudflare have claimed they are not vulnerable to the attacks, due to their implementation.
* Red Hat notes that if a technology blocks the exploitation completely the severity might be adjusted downwards
