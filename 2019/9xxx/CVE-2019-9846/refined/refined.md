{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering of the 'where' parameter within the `publictreestore` method of the `webmain/webmainAction.php` file in the rockoa framework. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the 'where' parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the vulnerability allows an ordinary user to retrieve administrator information.",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP GET requests with a crafted 'where' parameter targeting the `publictreestore` method. The specific parameters used are `a=publictreestore&m=menu|main/yingyong&XDEBUG_SESSION_START=17363&ajaxbool=true&tablename_abc=admin&pidfields=id&fistid=1&idfields=tel`",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to a rockoa instance with a user account, and be able to craft HTTP GET requests."
