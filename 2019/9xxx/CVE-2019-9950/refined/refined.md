Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-9950:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `login_mgr.cgi` script using the `/etc/shadow` file to verify credentials for the device's web interface.  The `nobody` user in this file has an empty password by default, allowing anyone to log in as this user.

**Weakness:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the usage of a default empty password for the `nobody` user, effectively allowing anyone to obtain a user session without knowing any credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can bypass authentication and gain a low-privilege user session.
*   Although the access gained is low-privilege, it can be further leveraged to achieve remote code execution due to other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the WD My Cloud device.
*   **Direct HTTP Request:** By sending a POST request to the `login_mgr.cgi` script with the username "nobody" and an empty password, an attacker can obtain a valid session token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the IP address of the WD My Cloud device.
*   The attacker must have network access to the device.
*   No prior authentication is required, since the empty password allows bypassing this step.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided information indicates that this vulnerability was patched in firmware version 2.31.174.
The exploitation of this vulnerability is a prerequisite for further attacks like the RCE through command injection (CVE-2019-9949) or unauthenticated file upload (CVE-2019-9951).
