Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Fujitsu Wireless Keyboard Set LX901 receiver (USB dongle) processes both AES-encrypted and unencrypted data packets.
*   The receiver accepts unencrypted packets that adhere to the data packet format described in the CY4672 PRoC LP Reference Design Kit, even though it should only process encrypted packets from the keyboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cryptographic Issues (CWE-310):** The vulnerability stems from an insecure implementation of the data communication protocol where the receiver accepts unencrypted data, circumventing the intended AES encryption.
*   **Keystroke Injection Vulnerability:** An attacker can inject arbitrary keystrokes by sending crafted, unencrypted data packets to the receiver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Control:** An attacker can remotely take control of the victim's computer by injecting keystrokes.
*   **Malware Installation:** In combination with replay attacks, the attacker can bypass screen locks and potentially install malware on unattended systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Radio Frequency:** The attacker sends malicious, unencrypted data packets via a 2.4 GHz transceiver to the receiver (USB dongle) of the vulnerable keyboard set.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within radio range of the receiver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker needs to have the knowledge to craft and transmit data packets that adhere to the specific format used by the receiver (CY4672 PRoC LP Reference Design Kit).
*   **Hardware:** The attacker needs a 2.4 GHz transceiver capable of sending data packets. The provided PoC used a custom firmware on a 4-in-1 wireless module with a CYRF6936 transceiver.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within the radio range of the receiver.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the receiver (USB dongle) of the Fujitsu Wireless Keyboard Set LX901, not the keyboard itself.
*   The keyboard transmits using AES encryption.
*   The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be combined with a previously disclosed replay attack (SYSS-2016-068) to bypass screen locks, increasing the potential damage.
