Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles arbitrary text sent over an FTP connection. When a page reload is initiated after such a connection, the received text is incorporated into a modal alert message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of proper input sanitization:** Firefox doesn't sanitize the text received from the FTP connection before displaying it in an alert box.
- **Bypass of alert box restrictions:** The vulnerability allows bypassing restrictions usually applied to modal alert boxes, which webpages are normally not able to fully control. This is because the alert is not generated by a script within the page, but by the browser's handling of the FTP response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Social Engineering Attacks:** The vulnerability can be exploited for social engineering attacks because an attacker can control the content of the alert message.
- The user is shown a modal dialog box with arbitrary attacker-controlled text. While not directly exploitable for arbitrary code execution, the spoofed text could potentially be used to phish for credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  An attacker sets up a malicious FTP server.
2.  The victim's browser attempts to access a resource from this server.
3.  The attacker sends arbitrary text over the FTP connection.
4.  The victim reloads the page causing Firefox to display a modal alert box containing the attacker-controlled text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control an FTP server or be able to inject text into an existing FTP connection.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim into accessing the malicious FTP resource or trigger a reload after the FTP connection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists because Firefox uses a different code path for handling FTP connections compared to HTTP connections, particularly when it comes to displaying alerts.
- This issue is related to the broader problem of modal dialog abuses and the lack of proper sandboxing for these dialogs, as noted in the bug report's discussion.
- The fix for this vulnerability is also tied to the fixes for similar FTP-related vulnerabilities, particularly those concerning denial of service through excessive authentication prompts.
