CVE-2019-9773:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Heap-based buffer overflow in the `dwg_decode_eed_data` function at `decode.c`, specifically when handling the z dimension of a 3D point.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow.
  - Impact of exploitation:  Denial of service due to a crash, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
  - Attack vectors:  Maliciously crafted DWG file that is processed by libredwg.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to a user or application that uses libredwg.

CVE-2019-9772:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: NULL pointer dereference in the `dwg_dxf_LEADER` function within `dwg.spec`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: NULL pointer dereference.
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service through application crash.
  - Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted DWG file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to a user or application using libredwg.

CVE-2019-9770:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Heap-based buffer overflow in the `dwg_decode_eed_data` function at `decode.c`, specifically for the y dimension.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer overflow
  - Impact of exploitation:  Denial of service due to a crash, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
  - Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted DWG file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to a user or application that uses libredwg.

CVE-2019-9776:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: NULL pointer dereference in the `dwg_dxf_LTYPE` function within `dwg.spec`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: NULL pointer dereference.
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service due to application crash.
  - Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted DWG file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to a user or application using libredwg.

CVE-2019-9775:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Out-of-bounds read in the `dwg_dxf_BLOCK_CONTROL` function within `dwg.spec`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Out-of-bounds read.
  - Impact of exploitation: Information disclosure or denial of service.
  - Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted DWG file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to a user or application using libredwg.

CVE-2019-9771:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: NULL pointer dereference in the `bit_convert_TU` function within `bits.c`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: NULL pointer dereference
  - Impact of exploitation: Denial of service through application crash.
  - Attack vectors: Maliciously crafted DWG file.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted DWG file to a user or application that uses libredwg.
