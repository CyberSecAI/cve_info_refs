Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-9649

**Description:**
Core FTP Server v2 build 674 and below is vulnerable to directory traversal using the MDTM command. This allows an attacker to potentially determine the existence of files and their last modified date outside of the server's root directory.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation when handling the MDTM command, specifically in how it processes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..\..\`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to traverse directories outside the intended root directory of the FTP server. This is achieved using `..\..\` sequences in the path provided to the MDTM command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can determine if specific files exist on the server and can retrieve the last modified time of those files. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about the server's file system and the presence of particular files which might aid in further attacks.
- **Limited impact:** It does not appear that the vulnerability allows reading the files, only knowing of their existence and their last modified date.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the FTP MDTM command.
- The attacker sends a modified MDTM command with directory traversal sequences in the file path, like `MDTM C:\..\..\..\..\..\..\Windows\System32\ARP.exe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target FTP server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send FTP commands, but does not need to be authenticated as the exploit works on unauthenticated connections.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited using Netcat.
- The Metasploit module automates the exploitation, allowing penetration testers to check for vulnerable servers.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to FTP/SSL/TLS and does not affect SSH/SFTP or HTTPS.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Core FTP Server versions after build 674.
- The issue was initially reported by Kevin R.
