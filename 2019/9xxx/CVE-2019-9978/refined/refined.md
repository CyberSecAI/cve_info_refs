{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin's debugging feature allows arbitrary settings to be updated via a GET request using a URL parameter `swp_url` without proper sanitization, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file_get_contents() on user controlled URL",
      "Inadequate input sanitization",
       "Use of  `is_admin()` function incorrectly, only checking if its an admin page and not for admin role"
      "Improper access control",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is then executed on the browsers of all users visiting the site, including administrators. This can be used to redirect users to malicious sites, steal cookies, or perform other actions within the browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "HTTP GET request with crafted `swp_debug` and `swp_url` parameters to admin-post.php",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) by loading a payload file from attacker-controlled URL"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to make an HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint with the right parameters."
