Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9853:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A URL decoding flaw existed in LibreOffice's processing of URLs that point to macros within documents. Specifically, how these URLs were parsed and categorized did not properly decode the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient URL Decoding:** The vulnerability lies in the inadequate decoding of URLs used to locate macros within documents, which lead to a bypass of macro security settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassed Security Settings:** Attackers could craft documents where the macros would execute even if the user had security settings that blocked macro execution.
- **Arbitrary Macro Execution:** This allows for the execution of arbitrary code embedded in the macros.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Document:** The attack vector is a specially crafted LibreOffice document containing a malicious macro.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Document Creation:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify LibreOffice documents.
- **Social Engineering:** Some social engineering might be needed to convince the user to open the malicious document.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly decode the macro URL before processing, leading to the categorization bypass.
- The user was correctly prompted that the document contains macros, but the security settings designed to control their execution were not applied.
- This vulnerability affects LibreOffice versions 6.2 series prior to 6.2.7 and 6.3 series versions prior to 6.3.1.
- The fix involves properly decoding the URL describing the script location before further processing.
