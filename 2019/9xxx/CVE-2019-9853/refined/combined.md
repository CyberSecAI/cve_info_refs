| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1152684#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-10-01 13:22:40 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-9853  LibreOffice documents can contain macros. The execution of those macros is controlled by the document security settings, typically execution of macros are blocked by default. A URL decoding flaw existed in how the urls to the macros within the document were processed and categorized, resulting in the possibility to construct a document where macro execution bypassed the security settings. The documents were correctly detected as containing macros, and prompted the user to their existence within the documents, but macros within the document were subsequently not controlled by the security settings allowing arbitrary macro execution This issue affects: LibreOffice 6.2 series versions prior to 6.2.7; LibreOffice 6.3 series versions prior to 6.3.1.

LibreOffice extension called [localwriter](https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter). Here’s what he had to say…**

**Dione Maddern** and The Documentation Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of the **LibreOffice Calc Guide 24.8**, an update of the existing Calc Guide 24.2 with enhancements taken from the current LibreOffice 24.8 Calc module.

The book was reviewed for clarity, readability and content additions, notably the **Calc database table referencing in formulas**, removal of deprecated JavaScript debugger and refactoring of the Calc’s chart topic – in which the chapter on charts was split in two, one for the chart basics and the second for the chart types.…

**Marcial Machado recently [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libreoffice/comments/1hf4sqo/i_made_an_impress_template_in_native_opt_to_play/) about his “fully-featured LibreOffice Impress template for creating Jeopardy-style games.

At its core, the template is meant to emulate what a game of Jeopardy is like. You can click on any of the squares on the game board and it will send you to the slide with the associated question, where you can either return to the board in the case of a misclick, or reveal the answer to the question.…

### CVE-2019-9853

**Title:** CVE-2019-9853 Insufficient URL decoding flaw in categorizing macro location

**Announced:** September 27, 2019

**Fixed in:** 6.2.6/6.3.1

**Description**:

LibreOffice documents can contain macros. The execution of those macros is controlled by the document security settings, typically execution of macros are blocked by default.

A URL decoding flaw existed in how the urls to the macros within the document were processed and categorized, resulting in the possibility to construct a document where macro execution bypassed the security settings.

The documents were correctly detected as containing macros, and prompted the user to their existence within the documents, but macros within the document were subsequently not controlled by the security settings allowing arbitrary macro execution

In the fixed versions, the parsed url describing the script location is correctly decoded before further processing.

**Credits**:

Thanks to Nils Emmerich of ERNW Research GmbH for discovering and reporting this issue

Dear subscribers,

we're sharing our latest advisory with you and like to thank everyone who contributed in finding and solving those
vulnerabilities. Feel free to join our bug bounty programs for OX AppSuite Dovecot and PowerDNS at HackerOne.

Yours sincerely,
Martin Heiland, Open-Xchange GmbH

Product: OX App Suite / OX Documents
Vendor: OX Software GmbH

Internal reference: 67871, 68258 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918)
Vulnerable version: 7.10.2 and earlier
Vulnerable component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.6.3-rev49, 7.8.4-rev66, 7.10.1-rev25, 7.10.2-rev19
Vendor notification: 2019-10-31
Solution date: 2019-12-09
Public disclosure: 2020-02-19
CVE reference: CVE-2019-18846
CVSS: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
The attachment API for Calendar, Tasks etc. allows to define references to E-Mail attachments that should be added.
This reference was not checked against a sufficient protocol and host blacklist.

Risk:
Users can trigger API calls that invoke local files or URLs. Content provided by these resources would be added as
attachment.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a task
2. Use the /ajax/attachment?action=attach API call and provide a URL
    "datasource": {
        "identifier": "com.openexchange.url.mail.attachment",
        "url": "file:///var/file"
    }

Solution:
We have implemented a protocol and host blacklist to avoid invoking any file-system references and local addresses.

Internal reference: 67874 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918)
Vulnerable version: 7.10.2 and earlier
Vulnerable component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.6.3-rev49, 7.8.4-rev66, 7.10.1-rev25, 7.10.2-rev19
Vendor notification: 2019-10-31
Solution date: 2019-12-09
Public disclosure: 2020-02-19
Researcher Credits: chbi
CVE reference: CVE-2019-18846
CVSS: 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
The RSS feature allows to add arbitrary data sources. To avoid exposing confidential data we implemented a host
blacklist and protocol whitelist. Due to an error the host blacklist was not checked in case the protocol passed the
whitelist.

Risk:
Users can trigger API calls that invoke local URLs, if a host can be accessed a different error will be returned
compared to unavailable hosts. This can be used to discover an internal network topology and services.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a RSS feed
2. Use <http://127.0.0.1.nip.io:80/test.xml> as RSS feed
3. Monitor the response code

Solution:
We fixed the blacklist evaluation and avoid access to blacklisted hosts regardless of the port evaluation. Please
consider adjusting com.openexchange.messaging.rss.feed.blacklist to you network layout.

CVSS: 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
The snippets API allows to add arbitrary data sources. This reference was not checked against a sufficient protocol and
host blacklist.

Risk:
Users can trigger API calls that invoke local URLs, if a host can be accessed a different error will be returned
compared to unavailable hosts. This can be used to discover an internal network topology, services and files.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a snippet with HTML content
2. Include a reference to an internal host/service
<img src="[http://localhost:22/badboy"](http://localhost:22/badboy%22);>
3. Monitor the response code

Solution:
We implemented a protocol and host blacklist to avoid invoking any file-system references and local addresses.

CVE reference: CVE-2019-18846
CVSS: 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
The mail accounts feature allows to add arbitrary data sources. To avoid exposing confidential data we implemented a
host blacklist and protocol whitelist. Due to an error the host blacklist was not checked in case the protocol passed
the whitelist.

Risk:
Users can trigger API calls that invoke local URLs, if a host can be accessed a different error will be returned
compared to unavailable hosts. This can be used to discover an internal network topology and services.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a mail account
2. Use 127.0.0.1:143 as IMAP server
3. Monitor the network socket

Solution:
We fixed the blacklist evaluation and avoid access to blacklisted hosts regardless of the port evaluation. Please
consider adjusting com.openexchange.mail.account.blacklist to you network layout.

Internal reference: 67983 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918)
Vulnerable version: 7.10.2
Vulnerable component: office
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.10.2-rev4
Vendor notification: 2019-11-05
Solution date: 2019-12-09
Public disclosure: 2020-02-19
Researcher Credits: chbi
CVE reference: CVE-2019-18846
CVSS: 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
Recent versions of OX Documents allow to invoke images from URL sources. Since no sufficient blacklist was in place,
this allows to make the server-side request arbitrary image resources.

Risk:
Users can trigger API calls that invoke local URLs, if a host can be accessed a different error will be returned
compared to unavailable hosts. This can be used to discover an internal network topology and services.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a OX Documents document
2. Insert an image from URL and specify a local address, like <http://127.0.0.1/test.jpg>
3. Monitor the response code

Solution:
We implemented a host blacklist to avoid invoking any local addresses and operator-defined network blocks. Please
consider adjusting com.openexchange.office.upload.blacklist to you network layout.

Internal reference: 68252 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918)
Vulnerable version: 7.10.2 and earlier
Vulnerable component: readerengine
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.8.4-rev10, 7.10.1-rev5, 7.10.2-rev6
Vendor notification: 2019-11-15
Solution date: 2019-12-09
Public disclosure: 2020-02-19
CVE reference: CVE-2019-18846
CVSS: 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
Documentconverter can be used to convert "remote" URLs to return images. The source for those URLs was not checked
against a blacklist.

Risk:
Local resources like images or websites could be invoked by end-users and expose their content through the generated
image.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a document and use a image "from URL"
2. Enter a URL that redirects to the local documentconverter instance which again contains a reference to a local
resource
http%3A//localhost%3A8008/documentconverterws%3Faction%3Dconvert%26url%3Dhttp%253A//localhost/%26targetformat%3Dpng

Solution:
We now reject redirects and check provided URLs against blacklists and protocol whitelists.

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinnÃ¼tzige rechtsfÃ¤hige Stiftung des bÃ¼rgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world’s leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

### Donate

LibreOffice is made possible by the efforts of thousands of volunteers around the globe, and by the generosity of donors. [Please support our efforts: your donation helps us to deliver a better product!](https://www.libreoffice.org/donate/)

### Become a TDF Member

If you are one of the volunteers contributing to the LibreOffice or Document Liberation projects, you should consider the opportunity of becoming a [member](/members/) of The Document Foundation, by filling the [application form](https://membership.documentfoundation.org/).

### The Bodies of the Foundation

The formal bodies of the Foundation are:

* The [Board of Directors](/board/) (or “BoD”). The Foundation’s Board of Directors is the main administration of the Foundation’s projects and teams. Board members are the foundation’s judicial and extrajudicial representatives.
* The [Membership Committee](/mc/) (or “MC”). Mission of the MC is to administer membership applications and renewals and to oversee election of the BoD.
* The [Board of Trustees](/members/) (or “Members”). The Board of Trustees consists of all people actively contributing to the Foundation’s projects. To be acknowledged as a member you need to meet the [criteria defined in our statutes](/statutes/) and apply for membership using our [application form](https://membership.documentfoundation.org/).

### Other entities and officers

There are some entities to help the BoD to further the foundation’s projects, but not being formal bodies of the foundation:

## Writer

* The “Words With TWo INitial CApitals” AutoCorrect exception list function has been extended to also be considered when changing case in “Capitalize first letter of every sentence” and “Correct accidental use of cAPS lOCK key” functions. This allows avoid auto-capitalization in words like mRNA, iPhone, fMRI. It has been renamed to “Words With TWo INitial CApitals or sMALL iNITIAL” [tdf#121779](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121779) (Mike Kaganski - Collabora).

* Add “Send Outline to Clipboard” button to Navigator 🡢 Context Menu (right click on “Headings”) [tdf#123395](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123395) (Wenzhe Pei).
* Variable input fields Insert ▸ Field ▸ More Fields... ▸ Variables ▸ Input field can now be edited inline, in the same way as was already possible for function input fields Insert ▸ Field ▸ More Fields... ▸ Functions ▸ Input field [tdf#123968](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123968) (Michael Stahl, CIB)
* Index/Table of Contents Update is now Undo/Redo enabled and no longer clears the Undo stack [tdf#38703](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38703) (Michael Stahl, CIB)
* Selection of drawing objects anchored at-character works more consistently and user-friendly now, and doesn't crash in Undo (Michael Stahl, CIB) [28b77c89dfcafae82cf2a6d85731b643ff9290e5](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/28b77c89dfcafae82cf2a6d85731b643ff9290e5)
* Native copy from Calc into Writer text tables (introduced in LO 6.2, see [tdf#37223](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37223)) improvement: only visible cells of a filtering are being copy and paste [tdf#124646](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124646) (László Németh, NISZ)

[![Only filtered rows of the Calc data are copied to Writer tables](/images/4/43/FilteredCalcDataCopyToWriter.png)](/File%3AFilteredCalcDataCopyToWriter.png "Only filtered rows of the Calc data are copied to Writer tables")

* Page backgrounds (color, gradient and tiled bitmaps) are now covering the entire page, not only within page margins [tdf#33041](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33041) (László Németh, NISZ)

[![Colored pages without white margins](/images/d/d9/FullPageBackground.png)](/File%3AFullPageBackground.png "Colored pages without white margins")

* New bottom-to-top, left-to-right writing direction in table cells and text frames, improving compatibility with Word [blog post 1](https://vmiklos.hu/blog/hackweek-2019.html) [blog post 2](https://vmiklos.hu/blog/btlr-text-direction-in-writer-2.html) (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)

### Interoperable text-based form controls

LibreOffice already imported Microsoft Word forms reasonably well - much had improved over the years - and from LibreOffice 6.3 on it is also possible to add Word form controls.
After setting the options Tools ▸ Options ▸ Writer ▸ Compatibility ▸ Reorganize Forms menu to have it MS compatible, the Forms menu in Writer changes.

[![Microsoft compatible forms menu in Writer](/images/d/df/Microsoft_compatible_forms_menu.png)](/File%3AMicrosoft_compatible_forms_menu.png "Microsoft compatible forms menu in Writer")

* Optional Forms menu layout, similar to Microsoft Office (Tamás Zolnai, Collabora)
* Implement GUI for legacy form controls (Tamás Zolnai, Collabora)

There is much more interesting to know about this improvement with forms; see also this page: [Form controls in LibreOffice](/Form_controls_in_LibreOffice "Form controls in LibreOffice")

### Open/Save Performance

* Improve performance of bookmarks. Export time is 1.5 times faster [tdf#117066](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117066) (Noel Grandin, Collabora)
* Improve performance of large tables. [tdf#84635](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84635) (Noel Grandin, Collabora)
* Improve performance of embedded fonts. [tdf#69060](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=69060) (Mike Kaganski, Collabora)
* Improve perfomance for some ODT files [tdf#63640](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63640) (Noel Grandin, Collabora)

[![Better performance of various file openings in Writer](/images/1/1d/Writer_Performance_Improvements.png)](/File%3AWriter_Performance_Improvements.png "Better performance of various file openings in Writer")

* See the full list of perf Writer bugs fixed in this version [here](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/buglist.cgi?component=Writer&f1=status_whiteboard&keywords=perf%2C%20&keywords_type=allwords&o1=notsubstring&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&status_whiteboard=target%3A6.3.0&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&v1=target%3A6.2)

## Calc

* Added UNO API to let cell anchored graphics resize with the cell (Samuel Mehrbrodt, CIB) [tdf#124329](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124329)
* Added new Russian ruble currency symbol to currency formats. It will display the **₽** character (U+20BD) instead of **руб.** or other localized variants (Eike Rathke, Red Hat) [tdf#96711](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=96711)
* Added new drop-down widget into formula bar instead old tool Sum (Gagandeep Singh) [tdf#120697](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120697)

[![](/images/thumb/8/8b/New_drop-down_widget_in_formula_bar.png/300px-New_drop-down_widget_in_formula_bar.png)](/File%3ANew_drop-down_widget_in_formula_bar.png) New drop-down widget in formula bar

* User can disable the extra dialog for search results. For activate of this dialog use option **Show summary of replaced cells** in dialog Tools ▸ Options ▸ Calc ▸ View ▸ Window [tdf#87965](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87965) (Heiko Tietze)

[![Search results](/images/thumb/f/f0/SearchResults.png/300px-SearchResults.png)](/File%3ASearchResults.png "Search results")

* Added a new checkbox in Data ▸ Statistics ▸ Moving Average dialog that allows trimming of the input range to the actual data content before computing moving-average. This checkbox is enabled by default. Also fixed the underlying performance problem even for the case when this checkbox is disabled (Dennis Francis, Collabora) [tdf#99938](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99938).

[![Moving Average dialog with the new “trim input range” checkbox.](/images/c/ca/Calc_data_movingAverage_trimInputRange.png)](/File%3ACalc_data_movingAverage_trimInputRange.png "Moving Average dialog with the new “trim input range” checkbox.")

* The auto-filter popup no longer flickers on Windows without OpenGL [tdf#101086](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101086) (Miklos Vajna, Collabora)
* It's now possible to sort range containing a protected labels row [tdf#119804](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119804) (Martin van Zijl)

### Rework Data ▸ Statistics ▸ Sampling dialog

All work was made by Eike Rathke [commit](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/65574/)

* Add “With replacement” checkbutton
  + checked: WR (with replacement, put back after draw), larger sample size than population size possible
    - mutually exclusive with “Keep order”
  + unchecked: WOR (without replacement, do not put back after draw), sample size limited to population size
    - automatically unchecked for “Periodic” samples

* Add “Keep order” checkbutton
  + checked: samples are drawn in order of population data
    - WOR method mutually exclusive with “With replacement”
    - automatically checked for “Periodic” samples
  + unchecked: samples are drawn in random order

[![Sampling dialog with the new options, “With replacement” and “Keep order”](/images/1/11/Calc_data_Sample_withReplacement.png)](/File%3ACalc_data_Sample_withReplacement.png "Sampling dialog with the new options, “With replacement” and “Keep order”")

* Limit “Sample size” and “Period” input fields to size of population for all WOR methods
  + when limiting, increment “Sample size” and “Period” up to their last known value when enlarging the population size

Previously, for “Periodic” samples the “Period” field was never limited, which for populations of smaller size makes no sense.

The new recent implementation for “Random” without “Keep order” and without “With replacement” set (WOR) strictly needs “Sample size” limited to population size.

### New spreadsheet functions

#### FOURIER() function

FOURIER(Array, GroupedByColumns, Inverse, Polar, MinimumMagnitude) is a matrix formula that computes discrete Fourier transform [DFT] of an input array (first argument) using a couple of Fast Fourier Transform algorithms. All features of this formula will also be available graphically via the dialog Data ▸ Statistics ▸ Fourier analysis [tdf#74664](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74664) [blog](https://dennisfrancis.wordpress.com/2019/03/27/discrete-fourier-transform-in-calc/) (Dennis Francis, Collabora)

The data in input array(first argument) can be:

* grouped by columns (needs to be indicated by flag GroupedByColumns = TRUE). In this case the array can contain 1 or 2 columns, where the first column contains the real part of input sequence and second column if present contains the imaginary part of the input sequence. If there is only 1 column, the input sequence is treated as purely real.
* grouped by rows (needs to be indicated by flag GroupedByColumns = FALSE). In this case the array can contain 1 or 2 rows, where the first row contains the real part of input sequence and second row if present contains the imaginary part of the input sequence. If there is only 1 row, the input sequence is treated as purely real.

The third argument “Inverse” is a boolean flag to indicate whether an inverse DFT needs to be computed. This argument is optional and the default value is FALSE.

The fourth argument Polar is a boolean flag to indicate whether the final output needs to be in polar coordinates. This argument is optional and the default value is FALSE.

The result of DFT consists of two columns - first column contains the real parts (or the magnitudes if Polar=TRUE) and second column contains the imaginary parts (or the phases if Polar=TRUE).

There is a 5th optional parameter, MinimumMagnitude. This parameter is used only if Polar=TRUE. All frequency components with magnitude less than MinimumMagnitude will be suppressed with a zero magnitude-phase entry. This is very useful when looking at the magnitude-phase spectrum of a signal because there is always some very tiny amount of rounding error when doing FFT algorithms and results in incorrect non-zero phase for non-existent frequencies. By providing a suitable value to this parameter, these non-existent frequency components can be suppressed. By default the value of this 5th parameter is 0.0, so \*no\* suppression is done by default.

### Changed spreadsheet functions

## Impress & Draw

* Users may now drag’n’drop multiple Impress animations to reorder them. (Brian Fraser) [commit](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/64129)
* Introduce an expert option ‘WriteLayerStateAsConfigItem’ with default value ‘true’. If you set it to ‘false’, the visible/printable/locked state of layers are only written ODF conform to part styles.xml, otherwise to settings.xml in addition. You might need the option ‘false’ to avoid inconsistency in case you manipulate layers via macro. (Regina Henschel) [commit](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/67784)
* OOXML preset shapes as used by PowerPoint or SoftMaker had some glitches in handle-movement, when you tried to alter the shapes in LibreOffice. The shape outline moved in opposite direction of the handle movement, or the handle jumped to a new location, when you touched it, or the handle was not movable at all. That is fixed for most shapes now. (Regina Henschel, [tdf#115813](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115813), [tdf#125126](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125126), [tdf#125181](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125181), [tdf#125445](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125445))

## BASIC

## Core / General

* LibreOffice TWAIN module on Windows was reimplemented as a separate 32-bit shim executable (twain32shim.exe). This allows both 32-bit and 64-bit LibreOffice to use 32-bit TWAIN Windows component. Now finally LibreOffice x64 for Windows is able to use scanner ([tdf#114635](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114635) - Mike Kaganski, Collabora).

* Ability to read and optionally generate MSO lockfiles was added. Now LibreOffice can report who of MS Office users has locked a document by reading the lock files generated by MS Office; and when "Create MSO lock file" is checked at Tools ▸ Options ▸ Load/Save ▸ Microsoft Office, LibreOffice would generate such files in addition to own lock files, to allow MS Office users to know who has locked documents, too. [tdf#34171](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34171), [41dc917b](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/41dc917b9b55b8c0c4307ffc58a1fb7257df2b69) (Mike Kaganski, Collabora / Tamás Zolnai, Collabora)

### New Feature: Redaction

Now it is possible to redact your documents with LibreOffice to remove/hide sensitive information. [blog post](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/company-news/redaction-tool/) (Muhammet Kara, Collabora)

[![Redaction tool in LibreOffice](/images/1/1b/Redaction_MuhammetKara.png)](/File%3ARedaction_MuhammetKara.png "Redaction tool in LibreOffice")
#### What?

Redaction in its sanitization sense is the blacking out or deletion of text in a document, or the result of such an effort. It is intended to allow the selective disclosure of information in a document while keeping other parts of the document secret. Typically the result is a document that is suitable for publication or for dissemination to others than the intended audience of the original document. For example, when a document is subpoenaed in a court case, information not specifically relevant to the case at hand is often redacted. [Redaction in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitization_%28classified_information%29)

Although there are some proprietary software applications in the market for this purpose, they have their own limitations like lack of support for open/libre document formats. Thanks to LibreOffice's great support for various file formats, and our recent work on implementing this new feature on top of it, it is now possible to redact most of your documents without leaving the comfort of your favourite office suite.

#### How?

* Open your document in LibreOffice
* Click (Tools ▸ Redact) from the main menu, and wait for your document to be prepared for redaction (converted to an internal meta-format, and transferred to Draw)
* Do the redaction by using the “Rectangle Redaction,” and the “Freeform Redaction” tools on the “Redaction Toolbar”
* Save & share the in-redaction copies of the document with peers either in the modifiable (odg) or the verbatim (pdf) format at your option
* Once you are ready to finalize the redaction, click the desired option on the “Redacted Export” tool on the Redaction toolbar

* [![Redaction command in the Tools menu of Writer](/images/thumb/e/eb/01-Redaction-Command-in-Tools-Menu-Libreoffice-6.3.png/600px-01-Redaction-Command-in-Tools-Menu-Libreoffice-6.3.png)](/File%3A01-Redaction-Command-in-Tools-Menu-Libreoffice-6.3.png "Redaction command in the Tools menu of Writer")

  Screenshot of a redacted document, finalized and exported as PDF

Some Notes:

* As a result, you will have a pixellized version of the redacted document in PDF. There will be no selectable text in it, and the redacted content will be non-existent.
* During redaction, the redaction shapes will be transparent and in grey so that the user can see what they are redacting.

[![](/images/3/3b/03-Redaction-Toolbar-Libreoffice-6.3.png)](/File%3A03-Redaction-Toolbar-Libreoffice-6.3.png) The Redaction Toolbar

* There are currently 4 tools on the Redaction toolbar (from left to right): Rectangle Redaction, Freeform Redaction, Redacted Export, Direct Export to PDF
* The Rectangle Redaction tool allows the user to mark the content for redaction by drawing transparent rectangles covering the content
* The Freeform Redaction tool allows the user to mark the content for redaction by drawing freeform lines/polygons covering the content
* The “Redacted Export” button box has two options: “Redacted Export (Black)” and “Redacted Export (White).” When clicked, it will finalize your document (by converting the transparent grey redaction shapes to opaque black or white shapes), and export as a pixellized PDF file. The “White” option might be preferred to save toner while printing.
* The Direct Export to PDF button allows the user to take an in-redaction copy of the document in PDF to share as a verbatim copy for review

## LibreOffice Help

* Help pages on [Python Macro programming](https://help.libreoffice.org/6.3/en-US/text/sbasic/python/main0000.html) (Alain Romedenne, Olivier Hallot)
* More pages on undocumented BASIC objects and functions (Alain Romedenne, Olivier Hallot)

## Feature removal / deprecation

### Java

Support for Java 5 has been removed. Java 6 is now the oldest supported version. (Samuel Mehrbrodt, CIB)

### General

#### GStreamer 0.10 deprecation

Support for GStreamer 0.10 is deprecated and will no longer be present in the subsequent LibreOffice version 6.4 ([6b911ae9eb9484bebbdc1323210020486f5ef33f](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/6b911ae9eb9484bebbdc1323210020486f5ef33f)). GStreamer 1.0 continues to be supported.

### GUI

#### KDE4 VCL plugin

KDE4 is out of maintenance upstream since November 2014. LibreOffice’s KDE4 VCL plugin has been removed and binaries provided by TDF have switched to KDE5 as the official backend. [410bf59de02192c2daf1158b9de76ec0ebab4c56](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/410bf59de02192c2daf1158b9de76ec0ebab4c56)

#### GTK+2 VCL plugin

The GTK+2 VCL backend is deprecated and will be removed in the next version.

#### Personalization

Firefox Personas search & apply functionality has been removed from the personalization dialog (Tools ▸ Options ▸ LibreOffice ▸ Personalization) as per the ESC & Design Team decisions, after major changes on the Mozilla side, which made it impossible to use their legacy API and the themes data for us. The default personas are unaffected, and still functional. Future improvements and more features are planned by the Design Team, thanks to now having a clean slate, without the burden of chasing an external API. Firefox Personas themes are dead; long live the LibreOffice Themes! :) [tdf#123831](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123831) (Muhammet Kara, Collabora)

* [![Personalization dialog with preinstalled themes, without Firefox Personas support](/images/thumb/d/dc/Personalization-Dialog-without-Firefox-Sup.png/556px-Personalization-Dialog-without-Firefox-Sup.png)](/File%3APersonalization-Dialog-without-Firefox-Sup.png "Personalization dialog with preinstalled themes, without Firefox Personas support")

  Personalization dialog with preinstalled themes, without Firefox Personas support

Please beware that although users may continue using their already installed personas as long as they don’t switch to a default persona; once a default persona is applied, there is no way to go back to the custom theme via normal means.

## Platform Compatibility

### Mac

* Statusbar shows Insert in normal mode on macOS (additional to Overwrite) to draw attention to the context menu [tdf#107918](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107918) (Heiko Tietze)

### Windows

* A proper console mode has been implemented [tdf#112536](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112536) [blog post](https://mikekaganski.wordpress.com/2018/11/21/proper-console-mode-for-libreoffice-on-windows/) (Mike Kaganski, Collabora)

### Linux

#### KDE 5 + Qt5

KDE5/Qt5 VCL plugin received substantial improvement since its first release in LibreOffice 6.2, including but not limited to:

* better integration of extensions by eliminating most of multi-threading and deadlock problems [tdf#119856](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119856)
* OpenGL support [tdf#121247](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121247) [tdf#121266](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121266)
* better drag’n’drop support, including external drag’n’drop from file manager [tdf#120772](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120772) [tdf#124990](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124990) [tdf#125160](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125160)
* improved rendering of slides and slideshows with multimedia content in Impress [tdf#124027](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=124027) [tdf#125219](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=125219)
* support for typing with input method editor (IME) [tdf#123956](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123956) [tdf#123957](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123957)
* miscellaneous improvements of native menu bar [tdf#122256](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122256) [tdf#121970](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121970) [tdf#123549](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123549) [tdf#123379](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=123379)

(Jan-Marek Glogowski, Katarina Behrens (CIB), Michael Weghorn (LHM), Aleksei Nikiforov (BaseAlt), Michael Stahl (CIB))

The full list of KDE5 bugs fixed in 6.3 can be found [here](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=RESOLVED&f1=blocked&f2=status_whiteboard&o1=substring&o2=substring&order=changeddate%2Ccomponent%2Cbug_id&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&resolution=DUPLICATE&v1=102495&v2=target%3A6.3.0). Further bugs and missing features are tracked via the KDE meta bug [tdf#102495](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102495).

#### 32-bit builds removals

Binary Linux x86 (32-bit) releases will be demoted. There will be no Linux x86 builds produced by TDF after 6.2. This does not mean that Linux x86 compatibility will be removed. If you need a 32 bit build, please have a look at your distribution.

## API changes

### UNO API changes

* The range of supported values for a Writer document’s `com.sun.star.text.ViewSettings` property `ZoomValue` has been reduced from 5–1000 to 20–600. [6287a4f0d18df7f195d1f14b7c24536317463a23](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/6287a4f0d18df7f195d1f14b7c24536317463a23)

* ~~Registering a XMouseListener/XKeyListener to a XWindow will now submit mouse/key events even if technically the events happened in a widget inside that window.~~ - this has been reverted in LibreOffice 6.3.4 due to various regressions (see [tdf#127921](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=127921)) (Samuel Mehrbrodt, CIB) [tdf#122920](https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=122920)

### UNO API additions

* A method `setArgs` has been added to the [XModel2](https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/interfacecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1frame_1_1XModel2.html) interface. It allows to set some [MediaDescriptor](https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1document_1_1MediaDescriptor.html) properties during runtime. (Samuel Mehrbrodt, CIB) [43a63b725208bfa378355011ea56cb936afa4411](https://git.libreoffice.org/core/commit/43a63b725208bfa378355011ea56cb936afa4411)

# CVE-2019-9853

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9852.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9854.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9853 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9853)

#### Description

LibreOffice documents can contain macros. The execution of those macros is controlled by the document security settings, typically execution of macros are blocked by default. A URL decoding flaw existed in how the urls to the macros within the document were processed and categorized, resulting in the possibility to construct a document where macro execution bypassed the security settings. The documents were correctly detected as containing macros, and prompted the user to their existence within the documents, but macros within the document were subsequently not controlled by the security settings allowing arbitrary macro execution This issue affects: LibreOffice 6.2 series versions prior to 6.2.7; LibreOffice 6.3 series versions prior to 6.3.1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1105173#c0)  Adam Majer   2018-08-17 07:22:47 UTC  ``` New Boost library has been released and unfortunately this package fails to build with it. The new boost library is soon submitted to devel:libraries:c_c++/boost and will be submitted to openSUSE:Factory shortly.  [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:adamm:boost_test/cmis-client](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3Aadamm%3Aboost_test/cmis-client)  [  163s] xml-utils.cxx:34:10: fatal error: boost/uuid/sha1.hpp: No such file or directory [  163s]  #include <boost/uuid/sha1.hpp> [  163s]           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [  163s] compilation terminated.  This is caused by removal of compatibility SHA1 header from Uuid boost library. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1105173#c1)  Tomáš Chvátal   2018-08-17 07:58:00 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/tdf/libcmis/issues/19>  Looks trivial :) I will give the upstream bit time to release new version tho. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1105173#c2)  Adam Majer   2018-08-17 09:38:28 UTC  ``` Yes, it's trivial fix. I've submitted fix to the devel project. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1105173#c3)  Tomáš Chvátal   2018-08-17 10:25:25 UTC  ``` Submission acked. I just wanted to not add patch since they will have to release new version... ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1105173#c4)  Adam Majer   2018-08-17 11:09:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomáš Chvátal from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1105173#c3)) > Submission acked. I just wanted to not add patch since they will have to > release new version...  I guess it depends how they patch it. If you don't add Boost version checks, it will fail to build with old version. Maybe proper way is not to use boost::detail namespace, but people ignore that all the time and then their sources look like chaos. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1105173#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-12-16 20:12:02 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:3313-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has three fixes is now available.
