Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the YOP Poll WordPress plugin echoing the `poll_id` parameter from a request without proper encoding or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where user-supplied input is reflected back in the response without proper encoding, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session within the vulnerable application.
*   **CSRF Bypass:** The ability to execute JavaScript can allow an attacker to bypass CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanisms.
*   **Data Access and Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data accessible to the user and perform actions on behalf of the user, including modifying data, changing settings, and other operations based on the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload in the `poll_id` parameter, such as:
    `http://192.168.0.103/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=yop-polls&action=view-votes&poll_id=1'"><img+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert(1)>`

*   **Social Engineering:** The crafted URL can be delivered to the victim through various means such as phishing emails, malicious links on websites, or other social engineering techniques to trick the user into clicking the link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `poll_id` parameter and the vulnerable endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=yop-polls&action=view-votes`).
*   **Ability to Deliver Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted malicious URL to the targeted user (e.g. via email, chat, website link).
*   **No Privilege Required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges or access on the target system to trigger the vulnerability as it's a reflected XSS.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was present in YOP Poll version 6.0.2 and patched in version 6.0.3
* The vendor was notified on 10/25/2018 and released a fix on 11/26/2018
