The provided content describes a vulnerability in GitLab related to the visibility of board names when project issues are set to "Project Members Only."

**Root Cause:** The API endpoint responsible for retrieving board names (`/api/v4/projects/<ProjectID>/boards`) does not respect the "Project Members Only" setting for issues, allowing access to board names even when the issue menu is hidden for public users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The API endpoint for fetching board names bypasses the intended visibility restrictions set for project issues.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposes board names when they should be restricted to project members only.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can enumerate the board names of a public project even if the issues are set to "Project Members Only". This may expose organizational structures or workflows reflected in the board names.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Direct API request to the `/api/v4/projects/<ProjectID>/boards` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attacker must have knowledge of the target project's ID.
*   Attacker does not require any authentication or to be a member of the project.
