- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The provided proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrates how a malicious HTML page can trigger an unauthorized request to the `/sftnow-master/index.php?g=Admin&m=User&a=add_post` endpoint to add a new administrative user when visited by an authenticated admin user.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability exists because the application does not properly validate or include any anti-CSRF tokens in the form submissions. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that are executed in the context of a logged-in user.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to create a new administrative user ("naive" with password "naive") on the system. This gives the attacker complete control over the application.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTML page containing JavaScript that makes a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker would need to entice an authenticated admin user to visit this malicious page.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host and distribute a malicious HTML page or embed the attack code within a page an admin user is likely to visit. The attacker needs no prior authentication/authorization to perform the attack.
