    {
      "data_type": "exploit-db",
      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the absence of a CSRF token in the request.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"

        "attack_vectors": "An attacker can host a crafted HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, will automatically send a malicious POST request to the vulnerable application.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page. This could be achieved via social engineering, like asking the admin to click a link."
