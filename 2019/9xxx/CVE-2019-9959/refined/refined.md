CVE-2019-9959: Integer Overflow in JPXStream::init function

- Root cause: The JPXStream::init function in Poppler doesn't check for negative values of stream length, leading to an Integer Overflow.
- Weakness: Integer overflow, which can lead to memory consumption.
- Impact: It becomes possible to allocate a large memory chunk on the heap, with a size controlled by an attacker, potentially leading to memory exhaustion or a crash.
- Attack vector: By maliciously modifying a PDF file being parsed.
- Attacker capabilities: An attacker can control the size of the memory to be allocated.
