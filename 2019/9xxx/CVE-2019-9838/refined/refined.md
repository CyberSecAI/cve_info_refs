The provided content is a list of web application advisories published by Invicti (formerly Netsparker). While it doesn't contain specific information about CVE-2019-9838, it does list various vulnerabilities found in different web applications, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Open Redirection, and Frame Injection. These advisories are identified by their internal ID like NS-YY-NNN format.

Based on the advisories list, it is clear that the Invicti scanner is capable of detecting the following common web vulnerabilities:

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple types, including reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS.
- **SQL Injection:** Including Blind SQL Injection
- **Open Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Frame Injection:** Injecting malicious content into a frame.
- **Code Evaluation/Execution:** Allows execution of arbitrary code
- **CSRF:** Cross-site Request Forgery
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** Exploiting XML parsers to expose internal resources.
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Allowing access to local server files.
- **HTTP Header Injection**

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies but generally includes:

- **XSS:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or defacing the website.
- **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to manipulate the database, potentially leaking sensitive data or modifying the database.
- **Open Redirection:** Redirects users to malicious websites, often used in phishing attacks.
- **Frame Injection:** Allows malicious content to be embedded into the target site, potentially leading to phishing or clickjacking attacks.
- **Code Evaluation/Execution:** Enables attackers to run arbitrary code on the server.
- **CSRF:** Enables attackers to perform actions on behalf of a victim without the victim's knowledge.
- **XXE:** Allows attackers to access internal files and resources on the server.
- **LFI:** Enables attackers to access sensitive information and code on the server

The listed advisories indicate that these vulnerabilities are exploited through common web attack vectors, such as:

- Maliciously crafted URLs
- User input manipulation
- Exploiting vulnerable XML parsers
- Manipulating HTTP headers

The attacker capabilities/position required depends on the specific vulnerability. Generally:

- For XSS: The attacker may need to inject code through user input or find other ways to inject malicious scripts into a web page.
- For SQL Injection: The attacker needs to manipulate parameters that are then used in an SQL query.
- For Open Redirection: The attacker needs to manipulate URLs to redirect the victim to a malicious page.
- For Frame Injection: The attacker needs to manipulate how a page is embedded in a frame.
- For code execution/evaluation: attacker has to inject the code that will be evaluated on the server.
- For CSRF: attacker needs to trick a user into performing an unwanted action on the web application.

The listed advisories do not directly provide details about CVE-2019-9838 but they demonstrate the various vulnerabilities that a web application might have and how Invicti identifies them.
