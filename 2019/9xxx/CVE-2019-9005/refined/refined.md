Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper authorization checks** within the "Power Scripts" add-on for JIRA. Specifically, the REST API endpoints `wfviewer/filecheck` and `wfviewer/filecontent` failed to verify if the user had the necessary privileges to access them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of authorization checks combined with user-supplied file paths through the `path` parameter allowed any authenticated JIRA user to probe and read arbitrary files on the server's file system. This is a classic path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:**  The API endpoints intended for administrator use were accessible to all authenticated users, bypassing intended access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read sensitive files from the JIRA server's file system. This could potentially expose confidential data, configuration files, database credentials, source code, and other sensitive information.
*   **Potentially Critical:** The Detack advisory labels the impact as "Critical".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Accessible API:** The vulnerability is exposed through the add-on's REST API.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploitation involves sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints (`wfviewer/filecheck` and `wfviewer/filecontent`).
*   **`path` Parameter:**  The attacker controls the file path via the `path` parameter in the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication to JIRA:** The attacker needs to be a valid, authenticated user within the JIRA instance. No administrative privileges are necessary for the exploitation.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the JIRA server.
