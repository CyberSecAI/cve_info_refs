Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-9852:

**1. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from an insufficient URL encoding flaw in the allowed script location check within LibreOffice. This means that the mechanism designed to prevent access to scripts in arbitrary locations could be bypassed.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient URL Encoding:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly encode the parsed URL, which describes the script location. This allows attackers to manipulate the URL using encoding techniques, such as URL encoding, to bypass the intended path verification step.
*   **Bypass of Path Verification:** The URL encoding flaw enables an attacker to circumvent the protection mechanism that limits script execution to predefined directories (share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python).

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute scripts located in arbitrary locations on the file system. This can have severe consequences because malicious scripts can perform a wide range of actions, including:
    *   Gaining access to sensitive data.
    *   Installing malware.
    *   Taking control of the user's system.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Documents:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted documents that specify the execution of pre-installed scripts. The attacker can use URL encoding to refer to a malicious script outside of the permitted directories.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Documents:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a LibreOffice document.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the specially crafted document. No specific privilege level is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also mentions CVE-2018-16858, which this vulnerability attempts to fix, demonstrating that this is a bypass of a previously implemented protection.
*   The fix involves correctly encoding the parsed URL before further processing, preventing the URL encoding attack.
*   The vulnerability exists in LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6 and 6.3.0.
