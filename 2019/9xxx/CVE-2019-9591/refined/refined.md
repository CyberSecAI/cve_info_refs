Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-9591:

**Vulnerability 1: Reflected XSS & Form Action Hijacking**

*   **Root Cause:** The `brandUrl` parameter in `/signin.php` is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
*   **Weakness:** Unsanitized user input in the `brandUrl` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, leading to:
    *   Form Action Hijacking: potentially redirecting form submissions to a malicious server,
    *   Session hijacking if combined with the session fixation vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript is sent to a user who clicks on it.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

**Vulnerability 2: Reflected XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** The `url` parameter in `/index.php` is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
*   **Weakness:** Unsanitized user input in the `url` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, leading to execution of arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser. This can be used for session hijacking.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript is sent to a user who clicks on it.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

**Vulnerability 3: Reflected XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** The `page` parameter in `/site/` is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
*   **Weakness:** Unsanitized user input in the `page` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, leading to execution of arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser. This can be used for session hijacking.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript is sent to a user who clicks on it.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

**Vulnerability 4: Session Hijacking**
*   **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of session cookies.
*  **Weakness**: The `PHPSESSID` and `chkcookie` cookies lack security attributes.
*   **Impact:** An attacker, exploiting any of the above XSS vulnerabilities, can obtain the session cookies of an authenticated user and hijack their session.
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting XSS to steal cookies.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to exploit XSS on the target application.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**

The identified vulnerabilities are multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues in different parameters of the ShoreTel Connect application (`brandUrl`, `url`, and `page`). Additionally, the application uses insecure session cookies, making it susceptible to session hijacking when combined with XSS exploitation.
