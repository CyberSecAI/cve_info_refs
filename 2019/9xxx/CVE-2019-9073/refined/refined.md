Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-9073:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in GNU Binutils, specifically within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, which is used for manipulating binary files.
- The issue occurs when processing a crafted file with a malformed VERDEFS section. The size of this section is read from the input file, and an attempt is made to allocate memory based on this size which can lead to an out-of-memory condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow/Large Allocation:** When parsing the size of the VERDEFS section, a large or malformed value is read from the crafted input file which leads to memory allocation attempt of large amounts of memory that exceeds available resources.
- **Lack of input validation:** The software does not properly validate the size field read from the input file before attempting to allocate memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The excessive memory allocation can lead to the `objdump` tool or other programs using the vulnerable library to crash.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Attempting to allocate large amounts of memory leads to resource exhaustion as the system runs out of available memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted input files:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user or automated system processes a specially crafted file.
- **Local exploitation:** The attack occurs locally, by processing a malicious file with tools that use the vulnerable BFD library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious file to the system that will be processed by a vulnerable program (e.g. `objdump`). No special privileges are required.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability, which is indicated by the "UI:R" vector in the CVSS score.

**Additional Details:**
- The sourceware.org bug report provides a detailed example using the `objdump` command, which failed due to a failed memory allocation within the libbfd.c file.
- The fix implemented addresses the issue by informing the user when an out-of-memory condition is detected instead of silently failing.
- The affected versions of binutils are prior to 2.35.2, which is confirmed by both the Gentoo advisory and the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4336-1).

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-9073 is a vulnerability in GNU Binutils that can be exploited by processing specially crafted binary files with excessively large sizes indicated in the VERDEFS section, which leads to a denial of service condition due to excessive memory allocation attempts.
