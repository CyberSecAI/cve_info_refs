The content is related to CVE-2019-9048.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Pluck CMS application lacks CSRF protection on several admin functionalities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities in the following functionalities:
    - Image deletion
    - Theme deletion
    - Module deletion
    - Article/Page deletion
- The application uses GET requests for state-changing operations such as deletion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions such as deleting images, themes, modules, or articles/pages without the administrator's consent. This can lead to data loss, disruption of the website, and potentially other consequences based on the website functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can embed malicious code (e.g., `<iframe>` tags) on a website or send a malicious link. When a logged-in administrator visits the malicious page or clicks the link, the browser will send the crafted GET request to the vulnerable Pluck CMS application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the URLs of the vulnerable functionalities.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link.
- The attacker doesn't need direct access to the Pluck CMS server but relies on the administrator's browser to execute the crafted requests.
