The provided content relates to CVE-2019-9693.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An SQL injection vulnerability exists in the default action of the CMS Made Simple application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present in the default action of the application. The specific vulnerable code is located in the `showtime2_data` class within the `_updateshow`, `_inputshow`, `_Getshowinfo`, `_Getpictureinfo`, `_AdjustNameSeq`, `_Updatepicture`, and `_Deletepicture` methods. These methods lacked proper input sanitization and validation for the `$show_id` and `$picture_id` parameters, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the CMS Made Simple application and trigger the vulnerable code.
- It appears that the vulnerable methods are part of a module, so the attacker would have to interact with this functionality.
