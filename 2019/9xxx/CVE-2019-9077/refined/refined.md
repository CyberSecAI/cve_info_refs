    "ID": "CVE-2019-9077",
    "content": "The provided data relates to CVE-2019-9077. It describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd), specifically within the `process_mips_specific` function in readelf.c, triggered by a malformed MIPS option section. The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `process_mips_specific` function in `readelf.c`, caused by improper handling of a malformed MIPS option section.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "heap-based buffer overflow",
       "integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (crash) or possibly arbitrary code execution. While the SUSE security team notes that binutils is a developer tool that does not receive untrusted input, and security exploits could inject regular binary code, the vulnerability remains a security concern if untrusted binaries are processed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attack vector",
      "Specially crafted binary file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft a malicious MIPS binary file containing a malformed option section. The crafted binary file must then be processed by the vulnerable binutils component, such as readelf."
