      "summary": "The provided documents describe a N1QL injection vulnerability (CVE-2019-9039) in Couchbase Sync Gateway's REST API. An attacker with access to the public REST API can insert additional N1QL statements through the `startkey` and `endkey` parameters of the `_all_docs` endpoint, potentially leading to sensitive data extraction or denial of service.",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of user-supplied input within the `startkey` and `endkey` parameters of the `_all_docs` REST API endpoint, allowing arbitrary N1QL code injection.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "N1QL Injection",
          "Insecure handling of user-supplied input",
          "Lack of input sanitization/parameterization"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can:\n\n*   Extract sensitive data from the database by issuing arbitrary N1QL queries.\n*   Call arbitrary N1QL functions.\n*   Cause increased resource usage and potential denial-of-service conditions through CPU-intensive nested queries.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Exploitation of the publicly accessible REST API endpoint `/db/_all_docs`.",
          "Injection of malicious N1QL statements through the `startkey` and `endkey` parameters."
