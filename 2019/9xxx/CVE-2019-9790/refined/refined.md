Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-9790:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in the way DOM elements are handled within Mozilla's Firefox and Thunderbird. Specifically, the `HTMLTableElement::DeleteCaption()` function obtains a raw pointer to a caption element. Subsequently, when `RemoveChild()` is called on that element, it dispatches a synchronous DOMNodeRemoved event, but the raw pointer to the removed element is not invalidated, leading to the use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The primary vulnerability is a classic use-after-free scenario. A raw pointer is used to access memory that has been freed after a DOM element is removed.
- **Incorrect Memory Management:** The issue arises from the incorrect handling of raw pointers and the lack of proper lifecycle management for DOM elements when removing from the DOM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The use-after-free can cause a crash, which is potentially exploitable, by allowing for arbitrary reading and writing of objects in memory due to accessing freed memory locations. The crash can be weaponized for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JavaScript:** The vulnerability is triggered by JavaScript code that manipulates DOM elements within a webpage, and this can cause a crash when the caption element is removed while in use.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Run JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within a web browser or in a browser-like context that uses the vulnerable component.
- **DOM Manipulation:** The attacker needs to craft a webpage or a JavaScript function to trigger the vulnerable code path by manipulating the DOM. This can be done by removing a table's caption while a JavaScript event listener is trying to access it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Firefox and Thunderbird.
*   The official fix involves ensuring the objects involved are kept alive during the remove process to prevent the use-after-free. The patch uses `IgnoredErrorResult` in `nsINode::RemoveChild` to handle errors.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Brandon Wieser of the Mozilla project.
*   The issue was also found to be present in older versions of Firefox and Thunderbird, and was fixed through updates to those versions as well.
*   The exploit can be triggered by crafting an HTML page to create a table and caption, and then trigger the `deleteCaption` method in JavaScript when a `DOMNodeRemoved` event is dispatched.
*   The fix is considered low-risk for regressions as it primarily adds a reference to the affected objects before the remove action takes place and uses an ignored error result, which does not alter existing logic but makes it safer.
