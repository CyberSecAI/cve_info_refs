Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-9951:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The file `web/jquery/uploader/uploadify.php` does not properly implement the login check, allowing unauthenticated access. This file is intended to handle file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is that the `uploadify.php` script allows any user to upload arbitrary files to the device without authentication.
*   **Path Restriction Bypass:** While the `check_path` function restricts uploads to `/mnt/HD`, `/mnt/USB`, and `/mnt/isoMount`, the lack of authentication allows attackers to still upload files to any location under these mount points.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload malicious files to the device's storage, which can then be used for further exploitation, such as:
    *   Executing server-side scripts.
    *   Overwriting system configuration files.
    *   Planting persistent backdoors.
*   **Full control of the NAS:** By combining this vulnerability with others (specifically CVE-2019-9949, command injection) full control of the NAS can be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the WD My Cloud device.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker can send an HTTP request to the vulnerable `uploadify.php` script.
*  **User Agent:** The User-Agent needs to be set to `Shockwave Flash`.
*   **CSRF Token**: A valid CSRF token is required to pass additional checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable WD My Cloud device.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Ability to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Understanding of the device's directory structure**: to target specific files for upload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `web/jquery/uploader/uploadify.php`.
*   The `login_check()` function is not properly used in the vulnerable file, which is the root cause of the issue.
*   The upload path is checked to be within `/mnt/HD`, `/mnt/USB`, or `/mnt/isoMount` which restricts the attack surface to the attached storage, but it's still an insecure implementation due to lack of authentication
*   This vulnerability was fixed in firmware version 2.31.174.
