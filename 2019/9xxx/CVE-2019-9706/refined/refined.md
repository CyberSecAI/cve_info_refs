Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `cron` daemon due to an erroneous removal of return statements. Specifically, the code frees a `user` struct (`u`), but then attempts to link this freed struct to a linked list, which leads to a use-after-free when the `new_db` is used later (e.g. in `find_jobs`).
- The vulnerability is triggered by the code path within the `load_database` function, specifically in `process_crontab` which calls `force_rescan_user`.
- The condition `if ((u->name = strdup(fname)) == NULL)` that leads to free is related to memory allocation failure, which can occur in low memory or embedded systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. A user object is freed, and then, a pointer to the freed memory is used.
- **Erroneous Removal of Return Statements:** This was caused by the removal of return statements in a previous commit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use-after-free condition leads to a crash of the `cron` daemon, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a `crontab` file that results in memory allocation failure leading to the code path described above, which then causes the use-after-free when the database is accessed.
- The specific condition for triggering it is a memory allocation failure (strdup) in `database.c`, line 599, causing the `user` struct to be freed, yet the code proceeds to connect the freed pointer into a linked list.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** A local user with the ability to create or modify crontab files can trigger this vulnerability.
- **Low Memory Conditions:** Triggering the memory allocation failure condition is more likely to occur on low-memory or embedded systems

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported as "critical" but later downgraded to "important" because memory allocation failure might kill the program.
- The fix involves re-adding the return statements that were removed previously.
- The fix is included in cron version `3.0pl1-133`.
- Debian LTS also issued updates to address this vulnerability in DLA-1723-1 (for Debian 8) and DLA-2801-1 (for Debian 9).
- The CVE description on DLA-2801-1 states the vulnerability as "Fix for possible DoS by use-after-free".
