- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Alarm.com ADC-V522IR camera stores its OpenVPN private key unencrypted and without access control, allowing any user with access to the camera to retrieve it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of the OpenVPN private key, lack of encryption, and missing mandatory access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the private key can perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and decrypt the data in transit between the camera and the Alarm.com server.
- **Attack vectors:** Requires shell access on the camera.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs shell access on the affected Alarm.com ADC-V522IR camera (0100b9). This can be achieved via a separate vulnerability (CVE-2018-19588), through which they can modify the configuration file and enable telnet, gain access to the camera, and then access the unencrypted certificate.
