If so, I hope you realize how antisocial it is to report security bugs only to downstream distributors like Red Hat and Debian and to aggregators like MITRE.  The polite thing to do is to report security bugs to software authors and maintainers some days or weeks before anyone else, to give them a chance to fix the problems before they affect the public.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c2)  seri0us    2019-02-28 06:37:07 UTC  ``` Thanks for your reply!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c0)  seri0us    2019-02-27 02:34:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1539022](attachment.cgi?id=1539022 "poc") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1539022&action=edit "poc") poc  Description of problem: There is a reachable assertion abort in the function write_long_string_missing_values() in sys-file-writer.c of the libpspp library in GNU PSPP  1.2.0 that will lead to remote denial of service.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 1.2.0  How reproducible: pspp-convert poc -O sav /dev/null   Actual results: assertion abort   Additional info: output ``` pspp-convert: src/data/sys-file-writer.c:1090: void write_long_string_missing_values(struct sfm_writer *, const struct dictionary *): Assertion `ftello (w->file) == start + size' failed. Aborted (core dumped) ``` source ``` In file: /home/pwd/fuzz/fuzz-pspp/pspp-1.2.0/src/data/sys-file-writer.c             write_int (w, 8);    1087           write_bytes (w, value_str (value, width), 8);    1088         }    1089     }  ► 1090   assert (ftello (w->file) == start + size);    1091 }    1092   ```   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c1)  Ben Pfaff    2019-02-28 04:23:48 UTC  ``` I fixed this on PSPP master with commit 0b842a843537 ("sys-file-writer: Remove assertions based on file position.").  seri0us, are you the person who discovered the bug?  If so, I hope you realize how antisocial it is to report security bugs only to downstream distributors like Red Hat and Debian and to aggregators like MITRE.  The polite thing to do is to report security bugs to software authors and maintainers some days or weeks before anyone else, to give them a chance to fix the problems before they affect the public.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c2)  seri0us    2019-02-28 06:37:07 UTC  ``` Thanks for your reply!  Sorry about my mistake. I will correct my action and report this issue to my team.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c3)  Ben Pfaff    2019-02-28 18:39:27 UTC  ``` @seri0us Thank you!   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c4)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-28 11:43:35 UTC  ``` pspp-1.2.0-2.fc30 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 30. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-6dcb6b21de>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c5)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-28 11:43:48 UTC  ``` pspp-1.2.0-2.fc29 has been submitted as an update to Fedora 29. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-817ff2201f>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1683499#c6)  Fedora Update System    2019-03-29 00:12:54 UTC  ``` pspp-1.2.0-2.fc30 has been pushed to the Fedora 30 testing repository.
