Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The cron daemon did not enforce a limit on the number of lines in a user's crontab file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The cron daemon would attempt to process any size crontab file without restrictions.
- Memory exhaustion: A large crontab file would lead to excessive memory consumption by the cron daemon.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A malicious user could cause the cron daemon to crash by creating an excessively large crontab file. This disrupts scheduled jobs and system functionality that relies on cron.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local user: Any user with the ability to create or modify their crontab file can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system.
- They need to be able to use the `crontab` command to create or modify their crontab file.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented limits the number of lines in a user's crontab file to 1000.
- The cron daemon now logs a warning for existing files exceeding the limit and the `crontab` utility prevents creation of new ones exceeding it.
- While technically it is still possible to create very large crontabs using very long comments, it will not impact the daemon, as it skips over comments.
- The maximum length of command is already limited to 998 characters, so entries are already kept in check.
