Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9472:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2019-9472 within the "Pixel Update Bulletinâ€”December 2019", under the "Kernel components" section, as well as a link to the commit that addresses the issue. Thus, the content is relevant to this CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `nvmet_fc_find_target_queue` function within the `drivers/nvme/target/fc.c` file in the Linux kernel. The function previously did not check if the queue ID (`qid`) was within the valid range before using it.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The code was missing a check to validate if the queue ID is within the expected range (`NVMET_NR_QUEUES`). If an invalid `qid` was provided, it could lead to out-of-bounds access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The vulnerability is categorized as an "Information Disclosure" (ID). The specific impact is that an attacker may be able to access information outside of the allowed memory range by providing an out-of-range queue ID, potentially leading to sensitive information being leaked.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to provide a manipulated queue ID to the vulnerable function.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to have a mechanism to influence the `qid` value provided to the vulnerable function. This could be through a crafted NVMe command or another method of interacting with the NVMe target.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix introduces a check `if (qid > NVMET_NR_QUEUES)` to ensure that the provided queue ID is within the valid bounds before accessing the associated queue data.
*   The provided git diff shows the exact code changes made to fix the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects the Linux kernel's NVMe target subsystem, specifically the Fibre Channel (FC) transport.
*   The Android Security Bulletin classifies the severity as "Moderate."
