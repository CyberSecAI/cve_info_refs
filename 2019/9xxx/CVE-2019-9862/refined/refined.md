Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE Reference:** CVE-2019-9862
*   **Advisory ID:** SYSS-2018-035
*   **Product:** ABUS Secvest Remote Control (FUBE50014, FUBE50015)
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)
*   **Risk Level:** High

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   The ABUS Secvest wireless remote controls (FUBE50014 and FUBE50015) lack encryption for their signal transmission, despite claims of "encrypted signal transmission" and protection against replay attacks using a rolling code.
*   An attacker can eavesdrop on radio signals from the remote control and observe sensitive data (including the current rolling code state) in cleartext.
*   The rolling code algorithm used is cryptographically weak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can analyze the packet format and communication protocol.
*   The vulnerability allows for unauthorized disarming of the ABUS Secvest wireless alarm system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Eavesdropping on radio signals transmitted by the remote control.
*   Analyzing the captured cleartext data to determine the rolling code state and algorithm.
*   Replicating or predicting valid commands to disarm the alarm system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Proximity to the target to intercept radio signals.
*   Equipment capable of capturing and analyzing radio frequencies (e.g., a sub-1GHz transceiver).
*   Knowledge of the packet format and communication protocol.

**Proof of Concept:**

*   A Teensy-based PoC tool with a CC1101 transceiver was developed to disarm the alarm system.
*   Successful disarming attacks were performed using the PoC tool, a Python tool for the RFCat-based radio dongle YARD Stick One, and an eZ430-Chronos with custom firmware.
*   A video demonstrates the attack.
