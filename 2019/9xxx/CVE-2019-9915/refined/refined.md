Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an Open Redirection issue present in GetSimpleCMS. The application does not properly validate the 'redirect' parameter, allowing an attacker to inject an arbitrary URL, causing the application to redirect users to a malicious site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirection:** The primary vulnerability is that the application redirects the user to a URL specified in the `redirect` parameter without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing pages, malware download sites, or other malicious locations.
- **Phishing Attacks:** By crafting a seemingly legitimate link with a malicious redirect, attackers can trick users into entering sensitive information on a fake site.
- **Damage to Reputation/Trust:** If users are consistently redirected to malicious sites via a vulnerable application, it can damage trust in the application/brand.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `redirect` GET parameter in a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and send them to the victim (e.g., through email or other means).
- **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges are required on the victim's machine or the server.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable URL:** `http://GetSimpleCMS-3.3.13/admin/index.php?redirect=http://r87.com/?localhost/`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `redirect` (GET parameter)
