Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9851:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an issue with how LibreOffice handles global-event script execution within documents.  Specifically, it was found that the protection added to block LibreLogo calls from document event script handlers didn't extend to global-event handlers. This oversight allowed documents to execute arbitrary pre-installed python scripts triggered by global events (like document-open).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient input validation:** The core weakness lies in the insufficient validation of the origin or path of scripts called via global events. This allowed execution of scripts not from authorized locations.
*   **Bypass of intended restrictions:**  The vulnerability bypasses the intended restriction that LibreLogo cannot be called from document event handlers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A remote attacker, by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document, can execute arbitrary python code present within a preinstalled script within LibreOffice. This could lead to a complete compromise of the user's system.
*   **Data Breaches:** Malicious code could potentially access, modify, or steal sensitive data.
*   **System compromise:** Attackers could gain control of the affected system for malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious documents:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted document containing a malicious script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Document creation:** Attackers need the ability to create and distribute documents that have the specific malicious script/settings.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to trick the victim into opening such a malicious document.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in LibreOffice versions 6.2.6 and 6.3.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Gabriel Masei of 1&1.
*   The issue is described in the context of both openSUSE and Debian security advisories.
*   The vulnerability was given a "moderate" severity rating by SUSE, while CVE lists it as critical (CVSS v3 score of 9.8)
*   Several operating system and product vendors released patches for this, including SUSE, openSUSE, Debian, and Ubuntu
*   The fix consists of correctly validating global script event handlers in the same manner as document event handlers, thus preventing arbitrary script execution.
