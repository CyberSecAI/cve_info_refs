Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9634:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Golang versions prior to 1.12.2 handled DLL loading on Windows. It used `LoadLibrary` without proper path validation or the more secure `LoadLibraryEx` in certain cases. This allowed for DLL injection attacks by placing a malicious DLL in the same directory as a Go executable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure DLL Loading:** The primary weakness is the use of `LoadLibrary` without ensuring that DLLs are loaded from trusted locations or by not utilizing `LoadLibraryEx` which prevents DLL injection. This exposes the application to DLL injection attacks.
- **Same-Directory Injection:** The vulnerability was exploitable when a malicious DLL was placed in the same directory as the vulnerable Go executable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable Go application. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **DLL Injection:** The attack vector is DLL injection. An attacker places a malicious DLL in the same directory as the target Go executable. When the application attempts to load a legitimate DLL, the malicious DLL is loaded instead due to Windows' DLL search order and the vulnerable usage of `LoadLibrary`.
- **Downloads Folder:** The vulnerability is particularly relevant to executables that are saved to the Downloads folder, since the attack is made easier if the executable is in a user writeable location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to the directory where the vulnerable Go executable is located (or where it will be placed).
- **Malicious DLL Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a malicious DLL file.
- **User Interaction (potentially):** The user would need to execute the vulnerable go executable (e.g. downloaded from an untrusted source), for the malicious DLL to be loaded.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves using `LoadLibraryEx` where possible and for cases where that is not possible, using absolute paths obtained with `GetSystemDirectory()` or with the exact string `kernel32.dll`, when calling `LoadLibrary`.
- The vulnerability was not mentioned in the 1.12.2 release notes.
- Patches were applied in the Go runtime and x/sys libraries.
