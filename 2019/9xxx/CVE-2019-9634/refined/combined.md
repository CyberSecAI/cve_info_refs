Subject: DLL injection in Go < 1.12.2 [CVE-2019-9634]

Hey folks,

Golang before 1.12.2 linked against various DLLs that were
same-directory injectable and generally its library loading mechanism
did not use LoadLibraryEx, allowing the classic DLL injection attacks,
especially with regards to executables saved to the Downloads/ folder
[1]. It was assigned CVE-2019-9634 and fixed in [2] and [3]. It wasn't
mentioned in the 1.12.2 release notes, so I'm mentioning it here
instead.

Jason

## Description

![@zx2c4](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10643?v=4&size=48)[zx2c4](https://github.com/zx2c4)opened [on Mar 6, 2019](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30642#issue-418006511)

[@bradfitz](https://github.com/bradfitz) suggested I open an issue for this rather than merely pushing fixes up to gerrit, so that we can track this for a 1.12 point release.

This runtime PR cleans up some LoadLibrary usage: [https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/165798](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/%2B/165798)

And this x/sys PR makes the fallback there more reliable: [https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/sys/+/165759](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/sys/%2B/165759)

The goal is that everywhere LoadLibraryEx preferred, but when not possible, LoadLibrary is called only with either an absolute path computed properly with GetSystemDirectory() or with the exact string `kernel32.dll`.

I haven't yet dynamically traced the exes yet to verify I've whacked them all now, but hopefully I or someone else can get that done before this issue is closed.
