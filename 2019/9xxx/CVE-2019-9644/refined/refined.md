Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9644:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in Jupyter Notebook where resources could be included on malicious pages when visited by users authenticated with a Jupyter server. This is due to insufficient protection against Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI):** The core weakness is the lack of proper protection against XSSI attacks. This allows an attacker to include resources from a vulnerable Jupyter Notebook instance into a malicious webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially leak sensitive information by including resources from a Jupyter Notebook instance on a malicious page. This could expose data, code, or other sensitive content accessible to the user via the Jupyter server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves an attacker crafting a malicious web page that includes resources from a vulnerable Jupyter Notebook instance.
*   Users who are authenticated to a vulnerable Jupyter server, upon visiting this malicious page, unknowingly trigger the XSSI vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious webpage that includes resources from a vulnerable Jupyter Notebook instance.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the Jupyter server, rather they need to entice an authenticated user to visit their malicious webpage.

**Additional details from provided content:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in Jupyter Notebook version 5.7.6.
* The fix involved setting `X-Content-Options: nosniff` on all handlers, adding CSRF checks on files endpoints and blocking cross-origin GET/HEAD requests with mismatched Referer headers
* Red Hat Bugzilla entries indicate this vulnerability does not affect any commercially supported Red Hat products, but was tracked for community support.
* Fedora updates address the vulnerability via `python-notebook` package updates.
