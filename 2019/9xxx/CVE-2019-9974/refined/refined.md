{
  "CVE-2019-9974": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `diag_tool.cgi` script on DASAN H660RM devices allows spawning ping processes without authorization, and `diag_get_result.cgi` allows retrieval of command output, leading to information disclosure and DoS attacks.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "CWE-862: Missing Authorization in `diag_tool.cgi` allows unauthorized spawning of ping and traceroute processes.",
      "Lack of authorization in `diag_get_result.cgi` allows retrieval of command output.",
      "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption allows memory exhaustion DoS attacks by spawning numerous ping processes.",
	  "Lack of input validation of arguments to the ping command which leads to traffic reflection and amplification"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": [
      "Information disclosure through enumeration of hosts on the LAN interface.",
      "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against the device through memory exhaustion.",
	   "Traffic reflection and amplification, potentially creating large amounts of traffic directed to a target"
    ],
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending HTTP requests to `/cgi-bin/diag_tool.cgi` to spawn ping processes.",
      "Sending HTTP requests to `/cgi-bin/diag_get_result.cgi` to retrieve command output.",
	  "Sending HTTP requests to `/cgi-bin/diag_tool.cgi` with large parameters to amplify traffic"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. No authentication is required."
  }
