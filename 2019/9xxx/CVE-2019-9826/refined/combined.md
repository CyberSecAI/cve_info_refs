Greetings everyone,

We are pleased to announce the release of phpBB 3.2.6 "You Know Nothing, Bertie Snow". This version is a maintenance and security release of the 3.2.x branch which fixes two security issues, introduces further hardening, and resolves various issues reported in previous versions.

Previous versions of phpBB allowed users to run searches that might result in long execution times and load on larger boards when using the fulltext native search engine. To combat this, we have now introduced further restrictions on search queries. We’d like to thank Snover for his report and responsible disclosure. The issue has been assigned CVE-2019-9826.

In addition to this, another edge case that allowed testing for the existence of files and services on the local network of the host using the remote avatar functionality was resolved. Due to the nature of the remote avatar functionality, it’s not possible to cover all potential accesses to the local network. Therefore we have decided to deactivate this feature in this update and admins will be shown a warning of the potential side effects in the Admin Control Panel if they want to re-enable it. The functionality itself will be removed in the next minor feature release. We’d like to thank Do Ha Anh of Viettel Cyber Security for his report and responsible disclosure.

The hardening introduced are among others the removal of the functionality to download database backups, further validation on administrative input in the Admin Control Panel, and the addition of form tokens to the login box. Most of these changes have been introduced to reduce the potential impact of admin account compromises or rogue administrators.

In our endeavours to deliver the most secure forum solution we have decided to further our reach in the security industry by joining the security platform [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/).

Some of the security improvements in this release are already the result of running a pilot program. We’ll soon change to a public program to allow submissions from everyone and add another way to easily report security issues. Until then security issues can be reported to the [Security Tracker](https://tracker.phpbb.com/projects/SECURITY) or by emailing to security [at] phpbb.com.

The fixed issues include, among others, support for cookies on domains with special chars, support for the Q&A plugin on MySQL 5.7, as well as preventing the installation of phpBB 3.2 on PHP 7.3. Full PHP 7.3 compatibility will be included in phpBB 3.3.

The full list of changes is available in the changelog file within the docs folder contained in the release package. You can find the key highlights of this release on the wiki at <https://wiki.phpbb.com/Release_Highlights/3.2.6> and a list of all issues fixed on our tracker at <https://tracker.phpbb.com/issues/?filter=14992>

**The packages can be downloaded from our [downloads page](https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/).**

The development team thanks everyone who contributed code to this release: 3D-I, mrgoldy, battye, Jakub Senko, kasimi, GanstaZ, jasonmarlin, AJ Quick, Alec, JoshyPHP, dhruveshk, rxu, Alfredo Ramos, Dark❶, Nuno Lopes

If you have any questions or comments, we'll be happy to address them in the [discussion topic](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=2509956).

Subject: [CVE-2019-9826] phpBB Native Fulltext Search denial of service

Vulnerability information
=========================

Title: phpBB Native Fulltext Search denial of service
CVE ID: CVE-2019-9826
CVSSv3 score: 8.6 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)

Vulnerability description
=========================

Improper input validation in the Native Fulltext Search component of
phpBB 3.2.5 and earlier allows an unauthenticated remote user to trigger
a denial of service attack via the keywords URL parameter of search.php.

Successful exploitation generates a slow SQL query which causes the
database engine used by phpBB to consume all available CPU resources.
Depending upon the database engine, users will also be completely unable
to create or modify posts due to locks on the search index tables. The
slowness of the query depends on the size of the search_wordlist and
search_wordmatch tables.

Because the denial of service is caused by a long-running database
query, for a typical phpBB installation running on MySQL/Linux, only <#
CPUs> requests need to be made by an attacker in order to consume all
CPU resources available to the database engine. The slow query will
continue to run after the attacker disconnects because PHP does not
detect connection aborts until it tries to send data back to the client.

Vulnerable packages
===================

phpBB 3.2.5 and earlier when configured to use the Native Fulltext
search component. (This is the default configuration.)

Solutions and workarounds
=========================

The vendor has released phpBB 3.2.6, which improves input validation in
the Native Fulltext Search component.

Mitigations are available for earlier versions of phpBB:

1. Set “Search backend” to an engine other than “phpBB Native Fulltext”
2. Set the “Can search board” group permission to “No” for all untrusted
user groups
3. Set “Enable search facilities” to “No”

Proof of concept
================

Due to the triviality of the attack, proof of concept code is withheld
for the moment in order to allow users some time to test and install the
vendor patch.

Report timeline
===============

The vendor was given a initial disclosure deadline of 2019-04-22. A one
week grace period was granted so that a fixed release could be available
at the time of disclosure.

2019-02-18: Initial disclosure to vendor with PoC and candidate patch
2019-02-19: Vendor acknowledges receipt of report
2019-03-12: Update requested
2019-03-13: Vendor verifies vulnerability
2019-03-15: Vendor assigns CVE ID
2019-03-19: Follow-up, no response
2019-04-15: Second follow-up

Package        : phpbb3
Version        : 3.0.12-5+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-9826

Colin Snover discovered a denial-of-service vulnerability in phpBB3, a
full-featured web forum. Previous versions allowed users to run searches
that might result in long execution times and load on larger boards when
using the fulltext native search engine. To combat this, further
restrictions were introduced on search queries.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
3.0.12-5+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpbb3 packages.
