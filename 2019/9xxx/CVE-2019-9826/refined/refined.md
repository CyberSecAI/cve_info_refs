CVE-2019-9826:
The content provided describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in phpBB's Native Fulltext Search component.

- Root cause: Improper input validation in the Native Fulltext Search component.
- Vulnerability: An unauthenticated remote user can trigger a denial of service attack.
- Attack vector: By manipulating the keywords URL parameter of search.php.
- Impact: Exploitation results in a slow SQL query, causing the database engine to consume all available CPU resources. Users may be unable to create or modify posts due to locks on search index tables.
- Required capabilities: No authentication is required. The number of requests needed to consume all CPU resources depends on the number of CPUs available to the database engine.
- Affected versions: phpBB 3.2.5 and earlier when configured to use the Native Fulltext search.
- Mitigation: Upgrade to phpBB 3.2.6 or later, switch to a different search backend, disable searching for untrusted user groups, or disable search facilities.
