- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root password for the Cobham EXPLORER 710 satcom terminal is the same across all firmware versions up to and including v1.08.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hardcoded root password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who can reverse-engineer the root password from one firmware version can use that password to gain authenticated access to any device running firmware up to and including v1.08. This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Reverse engineering of the firmware, exploitation of common default password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be able to reverse-engineer the root password from one version of the firmware, or have access to information about the default password, then the attacker would need network access to the device to gain authenticated access to it.
