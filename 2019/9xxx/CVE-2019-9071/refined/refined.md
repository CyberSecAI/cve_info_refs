Based on the provided information, here's a summary of CVE-2019-9071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Stack overflow in libiberty's demangler, specifically in the `d_count_templates_scopes` function within `cp-demangle.c`. This is triggered by a pathologically constructed mangled name.  Negative lengths could also be provided.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:** Uncontrolled recursion and missing input validation in the C++ demangling logic of libiberty.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to stack exhaustion.  Potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vector:** Processing a specially crafted binary/mangled name using the `nm` utility.

**Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a crafted input file to the `nm` utility. User interaction is required to process the crafted file.

**Fix:**
- Reject negative lengths in `cplus_demangle_fill_name`.
- In `d_count_templates_scopes`, replace num_templates and num_scopes parameters with a struct d_print_info pointer parameter, add recursion counter and check that the recursion limit is not reached.
- Pass dpi parameter to d_count_templates_scopes in `d_print_init`, and reset recursion counter afterwards, unless the recursion limit was reached.
