Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9764:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A configuration parsing error in Consul version 1.4.3 causes the `verify_server_hostname` setting to be ignored during TLS configuration generation. The default value (`false`) is always used, even when `verify_server_hostname` is set to `true` in the configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing Server Hostname Verification:** The primary vulnerability is that the agent-to-agent TLS connection does not perform hostname verification of server certificates. This is despite the configuration setting designed to enforce this check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:**  A malicious client, or a compromised client, can be restarted with the `-server` flag and masquerade as a legitimate server. Because hostname verification is skipped, the malicious "server" can connect to other agents and potentially gain access to data that should only be accessible to actual server nodes within the Consul cluster.
- **Compromised Cluster Security:** This bypass of hostname verification weakens the security of the Consul cluster and could be a key component of a larger attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack (Implied):** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability makes the system susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker can intercept traffic, present a valid but incorrect certificate and potentially gain unauthorized access.
- **Malicious Node Spoofing:** A compromised client node can be reconfigured to act as a server node, without being detected, due to the ignored hostname verification, and gain access to privileged information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to a Consul client:** The attacker needs access to a client node within the Consul cluster.
- **Ability to restart the client with the `-server` flag:** The attacker must be able to change the client's startup parameters to make it operate as a server.

**Additional details from content:**
- This vulnerability affects Consul version 1.4.3, both the open-source and Enterprise editions.
- The recommended configuration of setting `verify_server_hostname` to `true` is not being applied because of the parsing bug.
- The remediation involves upgrading to Consul 1.4.4.  All agents (client and server) that utilize the `verify_server_hostname` flag are required to be updated.
