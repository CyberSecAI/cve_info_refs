Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the HotelDruid application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The `anno` parameter in the `/visualizza_tabelle.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Input sanitization or proper parameterized queries are not implemented for the `anno` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database.
- This could lead to sensitive data exposure (e.g., customer data, booking information), data modification, or even complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to `/visualizza_tabelle.php`.
- Specifically, the `anno` parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement, implying that the vulnerability is likely exploitable without prior login/authorization.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL and how to inject queries.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects HotelDruid versions prior to v2.3.1, specifically v2.3.0 and possibly older versions.
- The vulnerability was discovered on January 21, 2019, and a fix was released in v2.3.1 on February 21, 2019.
- The advisory mentions that the `tipo_tabella`, `sel_tab_prenota`, and `opz_cerc_pren` parameters are also part of the vulnerable request, although the SQL injection is explicitly identified in the `anno` parameter.
- The provided PoC is: `http://[DOMAIN_NAME]/hoteldruid_2.3.0/hoteldruid/visualizza_tabelle.php?anno=[YEAR]'&tipo_tabella=prenotazioni&sel_tab_prenota=correnti&opz_cerc_pren=arr`
- The mitigation is to update to v2.3.1 or a newer version of HotelDruid.
