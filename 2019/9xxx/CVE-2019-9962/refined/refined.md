The provided content describes multiple crashes found in XnView Classic 2.48 and XnView MP 0.93.1 while fuzzing. It references CVE-2019-9962 as one of the identified issues, but does not specify which crash is related to this CVE. The blog post provides crash details for each identified vulnerability with the registers and the crashing instruction.

Here are the extracted details of the crashes:
**XnView MP 0.93.1:**
* **VCRUNTIME140!memcpy:** Crash occurs within `memcpy` due to an invalid memory access at `0x03941000`.
* **ntdll!RtlFreeHeap:** Crash occurs when attempting to free memory at an invalid address.
* **ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey:** Crash occurs within the function `RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey` due to an invalid jump address at `0x7733283b`.
* **ntdll!RtlReAllocateHeap:** Crash occurs within the `RtlReAllocateHeap` function during an attempt to reallocate memory at an invalid address.

**XnView Classic version 2.48:**
*   **xnview+0x38536c:** Crash occurs due to invalid memory access at `0x00301000` during `movdqa` instruction.
*   **ntdll!RtlPrefixUnicodeString:** Crash occurs due to invalid memory access at `0x00000004` when trying to read from the address stored in `ecx + 4`.
*   **ntdll!RtlQueueWorkItem:** Crash occurs when trying to perform `xor` operation on an invalid memory location `0xffffffff8`.
*   **xnview+0x385399:** Crash occurs due to invalid memory access at `0x00b2d000` during `movdqa` instruction.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause for all listed vulnerabilities is improper handling of image data and/or memory management, leading to out-of-bounds reads/writes or use-after-free conditions when processing specially crafted files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The identified weaknesses include:
*   Memory corruption vulnerabilities (heap-based overflows or use-after-free).
*   Invalid memory access (out-of-bounds reads/writes).

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:
*   Application crashes (denial of service).
*   Potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the corrupted memory.

**Attack vectors:**
Attack vectors involve:
*   Opening or processing a maliciously crafted image file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to:
*   Craft a malicious image file.
*   Lure the user into opening the file with the vulnerable XnView application.
