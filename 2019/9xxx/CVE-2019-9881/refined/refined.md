Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-9881:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the WPGraphQL plugin's weak access controls and lack of proper authorization checks before serving responses to GraphQL queries. This allowed unauthenticated users to access and manipulate data that should have been protected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure direct object references:** The plugin failed to verify user privileges before exposing data, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Lack of authentication and authorization:** The plugin lacked proper checks to ensure only authorized users could perform certain actions like creating admin users, posting comments, and accessing password-protected content.
- **Exposed sensitive data through GraphQL:** The plugin exposed sensitive data such as user lists, media files, plugin lists, themes, and the content of password-protected posts without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could create administrative users, gaining full control of the WordPress site.
- **Content Manipulation:** Attackers could post comments bypassing moderation and restrictions.
- **Data Disclosure:** Attackers could retrieve the content of password-protected posts, user lists, and other sensitive information.
- **Information Gathering:** Attackers could gather information about installed plugins, themes, and media files, which could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GraphQL API Queries:** Attackers could send malicious GraphQL queries to the vulnerable endpoint to exploit the vulnerabilities.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities were exploitable remotely without any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needed to have network access to the WordPress site.
- **Basic Knowledge of GraphQL:** The attacker needed a basic understanding of GraphQL to craft the malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**
- The identified vulnerabilities were present in WPGraphQL version 0.2.3.
- The blog post provided detailed examples of GraphQL queries to exploit the various vulnerabilities, including creating admin users, posting comments, retrieving password-protected content, and gathering information about users and plugins.
- A Python exploit script was made available, automating the exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerabilities were addressed in WPGraphQL version 0.3.0 with the implementation of a model layer which enforces proper access checks.
