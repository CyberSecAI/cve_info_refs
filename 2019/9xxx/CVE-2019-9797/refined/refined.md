Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how cross-origin images are handled when using `createImageBitmap`. Specifically, after using `createImageBitmap` to load an image without CORS enabled, exporting the resulting bitmap to a canvas allows JavaScript to bypass the same-origin policy and read the cross-origin image data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Image Theft:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to steal cross-origin image data.
*   **Bypassed Same-Origin Policy:** The use of `createImageBitmap` followed by rendering on a canvas circumvents the intended security restrictions of the same-origin policy.
*   **Inconsistent Handling:** There's an inconsistency between how `createImageBitmap` handles tainted images versus directly drawing a tainted `<img>` element on a canvas. Direct drawing prevents information disclosure, while the `createImageBitmap` method allows it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can steal image data from different domains. This can be used to gain access to private or sensitive images.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The ability to bypass the same-origin policy may expose users to various other malicious activities and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Browsing:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage containing crafted JavaScript code and images.
*   **JavaScript Code:** The attack is carried out by executing malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and needs to entice the victim to load a webpage with malicious code and a cross-origin image..
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript within the user's browser.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when an image loaded without CORS support is used to create an `ImageBitmap`, which is then drawn onto a 2D canvas.
*   The `createImageBitmap` function does not properly preserve the "tainted" status of cross-origin images.
*   The same-origin policy is bypassed when rendering an `ImageBitmap` onto a canvas, as opposed to drawing the `<img>` element itself.
*   The fix involves adding a security check similar to that in [bug 1526218](/show_bug.cgi?id=1526218)

The provided Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2019:1265, RHSA-2019:1267, RHSA-2019:1269, RHSA-2019:1308, RHSA-2019:1309, RHSA-2019:1310) details the fix for this CVE in various versions of their operating system by updating the firefox and thunderbird packages. Similarly, the Debian Security Advisory (DSA-4448-1 and DLA-1800-1, DSA-4451-1, and DLA-1806-1) addresses this vulnerability in Firefox ESR and Thunderbird, respectively. The openSUSE security update (openSUSE-SU-2019:1534-1) for MozillaFirefox also confirms the fix on their systems. The Suse advisory (CVE-2019-9797) also states that it has been resolved.

The Bugzilla entry ([Bug 1528909](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528909)) confirms that the fix involves the implementation of cross-origin checks in `CanvasRenderingContext2D::DrawImage` function. It was also discovered that this is a regression introduced by Bug 1502799 and also has a sec-high tag. It also mentions that the fix applies to Firefox 66 and Firefox ESR 60.7 and was reported by AaylaSecura1138.

The Mozilla Security Advisory (2019-14) confirms that the fix was introduced in Firefox ESR 60.7 which mitigates the Cross-origin theft of images with `createImageBitmap`.

The issue stems from the use of `createImageBitmap` to read an image and subsequently export it to a canvas element. This function does not properly enforce the "tainted" status of cross-origin images, resulting in the violation of the same-origin policy.

The provided content also includes references to other vulnerabilities addressed within the same security advisories, emphasizing the breadth of security issues addressed in Firefox and Thunderbird's various releases.
