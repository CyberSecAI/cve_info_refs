- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Wakaama LWM2M server incorrectly handles incoming packets, leading to a memory leak. Specifically, a crafted packet causes a 24-byte memory leak during processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory leak due to improper handling of incoming packets. The vulnerability is present in the `coap_add_multi_option` function, which is called during message parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Repeated exploitation leads to memory exhaustion, potentially causing the LWM2M server to stop functioning. Depending on the system configuration and isolation of services, this could also stop other processes on the same server.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor can send a crafted UDP packet to the Wakaama LWM2M server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target server (network access).
