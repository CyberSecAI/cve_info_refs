{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the JAMF Self Service application does not properly validate the server's response when running a policy. By intercepting and modifying the server's response, an attacker can inject a command to execute an arbitrary application, in this case the Terminal app.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of server response validation",
      "Improper handling of server data"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root. An attacker can gain a root command terminal by running a maliciously crafted policy.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept and modify communication between the JAMF client and server.",
      "Specifically, manipulation of the server's response to a policy execution request."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the JAMF client and the JAMF server. This typically involves controlling the local network or performing an ARP spoofing attack. They also need to be able to use a tool such as Burp Suite to modify the server response. The attacker also relies on the fact that Administrators can publish bash shell scripts using JAMF by default."
