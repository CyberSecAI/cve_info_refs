- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ABUS Secvest wireless alarm system uses a cryptographically weak algorithm for generating rolling codes used for replay protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable rolling code generation (CWE-341). The radio signals are unencrypted.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can remotely control the alarm system, including disarming it.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker observes the unencrypted radio signals from the wireless remote control to deduce the rolling code algorithm, then predicts future codes to send commands to the alarm system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be within range to capture the radio signals from the remote control and needs to have the capability to send spoofed radio signals using a suitable transceiver.
