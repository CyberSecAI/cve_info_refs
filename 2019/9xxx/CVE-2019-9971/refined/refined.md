Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-9971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the 3CX phone system, specifically due to the misconfiguration of `sudo` privileges. The `phonesystem` user is allowed to execute the `tcpdump` command as root without requiring a password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Sudo Configuration:** The vulnerability stems from granting the `phonesystem` user the ability to run `tcpdump` with root privileges via `sudo` without a password. This allows for a privilege escalation attack.
*   **Abuse of tcpdump:**  The `tcpdump` utility, when used with the `-z` option, allows execution of post-rotation commands. The vulnerability is that these post-rotation commands are run as root due to the sudo configuration. This allows the attacker to specify a malicious command to be executed as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate from the low-privilege `phonesystem` user to root access on the 3CX server.
*   **Full System Control:**  Gaining root access gives the attacker complete control over the server, potentially enabling them to perform any action, including data exfiltration, malware installation, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires a valid user account (`phonesystem` in this case) with access to the 3CX system's terminal.
*   **Command Injection:** In combination with CVE-2019-9972, an attacker can gain initial access via command injection, but CVE-2019-9971 can be exploited even without the first vulnerability.
*   **Sudo Abuse:**  Once the attacker has access to the terminal, they use the `sudo` command to execute `tcpdump` as root with the `-z` option to execute arbitrary commands as root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs valid credentials for a user account (e.g., `phonesystem`) on the 3CX system.
*   **Access to Terminal:**  The attacker needs access to the 3CX system's terminal, where they can execute commands.
*   **Understanding of Sudo and tcpdump:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability to leverage `tcpdump` with `sudo` for privilege escalation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions that CVE-2019-9972 is fixed in the next build of the software, but CVE-2019-9971 is still exploitable in the latest release.
