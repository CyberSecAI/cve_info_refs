  "CVE-2019-9200": {
    "description": "A heap-based buffer underwrite exists in ImageStream::getLine() located at Stream.cc in Poppler that can be triggered by sending a crafted PDF file to the pdfimages binary. It allows an attacker to cause denial-of-service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ImageStream::getLine()` function within `Stream.cc`. Specifically, a loop within this function is intended to fill a buffer (`inputLine`) with EOF characters based on a counter (`readChars`). However, under certain conditions, `readChars` can have a negative value, leading to an attempt to write to a memory address outside of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap-based buffer underwrite. This occurs after a call to `str->doGetChars(inputLineSize, inputLine)` which can return a negative value for readChars.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer underwrite"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (Segmentation fault), potentially unspecified other impact.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted PDF file",
      "Use of `pdfimages` binary with crafted PDF."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PDF file which will trigger the vulnerable code path.",
      "details": "The vulnerability is located in the `ImageStream::getLine()` function. In a loop intended to fill a buffer with EOF, the loop counter `readChars` can have a negative value when the `doGetChars()` method returns a negative integer. This results in out-of-bounds memory access/underwrite."
