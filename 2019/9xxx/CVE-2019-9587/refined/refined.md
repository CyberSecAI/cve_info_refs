The provided content is related to CVE-2019-9587.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack consumption issue within the `md5Round1()` function in the `Decrypt.cc` file of Xpdf version 4.01. This issue is triggered during the processing of a crafted PDF file due to recursive calls in `Catalog::countPageTree`, ultimately leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) leading to stack exhaustion.
- Recursive calls within `Catalog::countPageTree` without proper safeguards.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault caused by stack overflow.
- Potential for other unspecified impacts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted PDF file to a vulnerable Xpdf binary, such as `pdfimages`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file.
- The attacker must have the ability to deliver the crafted PDF to a system using a vulnerable version of Xpdf.
