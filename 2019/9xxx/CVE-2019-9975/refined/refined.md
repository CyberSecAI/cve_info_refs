Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the `syslog_tool.cgi` script on DASAN H660RM devices. The script uses the key "dasanektks123" for encrypting system logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-321: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key:** The primary weakness is the presence of the hard-coded encryption key within the `syslog_tool.cgi` script. This makes the encrypted data easily decryptable by anyone with access to the key.
*   **Weak encryption:** The encryption method used is AES-128-CBC which is considered weak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  An attacker who obtains the hardcoded key can decrypt the encrypted logs, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Access to the device's filesystem:** An attacker needs access to the device's filesystem where the encrypted logs are stored.
*  **Knowledge of the hardcoded key:**  The attacker must know the hardcoded key "dasanektks123" used for encryption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to the device:** The attacker must have some form of access to the device or the encrypted logs. This could be through network access to the device itself or by obtaining the encrypted log files by other means.
*   **Knowledge of the hardcoded key:** The attacker must know the hardcoded encryption key.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable script `syslog_tool.cgi` uses OpenSSL's `aes-128-cbc` encryption method.
*   The blog post provides a specific `openssl` command to decrypt the logs using the hardcoded key, confirming the exploitability.
```
openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -d -k dasanektks123 -in encrypted.tar.gz -out cleartext.tar.gz
```
*  The blog post provides a practical example of how to decrypt the logs, including the commands and example output.
* The vulnerability was identified in DASAN H660RM devices with firmware 1.03-0022, and possibly other versions.
