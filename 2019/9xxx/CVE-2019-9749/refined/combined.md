## Description

![@cve-reporting](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36542150?v=4&size=48)[cve-reporting](https://github.com/cve-reporting)opened [on Feb 25, 2019](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/issues/1135#issue-414191032)

Fluent Bit MQTT input plugin acting as MQTT broker (server) incorrectly handles incoming network messages.

After processing crafted packet, plugin executes memmove() function with negative size param.

That leads to crash of the whole Fluent Bit server via SIGSEGV signal.

Proposed CVSS 3.0 score: 7.5 (High)

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Reproduction:

1. Compile Fluent Bit with Address Sanitizer by enabling compilation flag: -fsanitize=address
2. Run Fluent Bit with enabled MQTT plugin:

   fluent-bit -i mqtt -t data -o stdout -m '\*' --config=conf/in\_mqtt.conf
3. Send attached crafted message e.g. using netcat:

   netcat (IP\_addr) 1883 < fluent-bit\_mqtt\_crash\_000.raw

   where IP\_addr is IP of test server
