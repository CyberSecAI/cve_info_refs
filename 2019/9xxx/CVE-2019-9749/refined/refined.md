- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MQTT input plugin in Fluent Bit incorrectly handles incoming network messages, specifically crafted MQTT packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin executes `memmove()` with a negative size parameter after processing a specially crafted packet. This leads to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The memory corruption leads to a crash of the entire Fluent Bit server via a SIGSEGV signal, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted MQTT message sent to the Fluent Bit MQTT input plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to send network messages to the Fluent Bit server on the port the MQTT plugin is listening on (default 1883).
