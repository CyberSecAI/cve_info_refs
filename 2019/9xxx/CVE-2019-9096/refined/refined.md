Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **weak password requirements** in the Moxa MB3xxx series protocol gateways. This allows attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access through brute-force password attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements** - The system allows the use of easily guessable or crackable passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the affected devices by successfully cracking or guessing weak passwords.
*   **Complete compromise:** With access, attackers can potentially read configurations, modify settings or gain complete control of the device

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   **Brute-Force:** Attackers attempt to gain access by trying different password combinations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device's web interface.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The attack doesn't require sophisticated techniques.

**Summary of CVE-2019-9096:**
The vulnerability exists because the Moxa MB3xxx series protocol gateways do not enforce strong password requirements. This weakness allows attackers to leverage brute-force attacks to gain unauthorized access and potentially compromise the device.
