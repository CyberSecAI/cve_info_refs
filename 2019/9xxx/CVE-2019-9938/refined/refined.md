The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the SHAREit Android application (versions <= 4.0.38). It does not mention a specific CVE number. However, based on the description, these vulnerabilities are related to CVE-2019-9938 which is about vulnerabilities in SHAREit app.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Authenticated Arbitrary File Download**

*   **Root cause:** The application fails to validate the `msgid` parameter in download requests to its HTTP server.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization checks for file downloads after an initial session is established.
*   **Impact:** An attacker who has had a previous session with a victim can download arbitrary files from the victim's device by crafting a specific URL with the file path.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable SHAREit server, specifying the target file in the `metadataid` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have established a session with the victim's SHAREit app at least once. They also need to be on the same network.

**2. Authentication Bypass**

*   **Root cause:** The application adds an unauthenticated user to the list of recognized devices upon requesting a non-existent page on its HTTP server.
*   **Weakness:**  Improper handling of non-existent page requests that results in unintended user authentication.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can bypass the SHAREit device authentication mechanism by simply requesting a non-existent page and be added to the list of allowed users.
*  **Attack vector:** Sending a request to a non-existent URL on the vulnerable SHAREit server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's SHAREit device.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   Older versions of SHAREit kept the download server running even without an active file transfer. Newer versions turn it off when not in use, requiring the attacker to find an active session.
*   Vulnerable SHAREit versions create an open Wi-Fi hotspot, making it easy to intercept traffic and exploit vulnerabilities.
*   The blog post also discusses the use of SHAREit's history and MediaStore databases to discover file paths for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, and patches were released, but the vendor did not assign CVE numbers.
*  The researchers created a tool called DUMPit which was used to exploit the vulnerability
