{
  "CVE-2019-9791": {
    "description": "The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "A flaw in IonMonkey's type inference when JIT compiling and entering a constructor via on-stack replacement (OSR) causes type confusions between arbitrary objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect type inference in IonMonkey JIT compiler.",
      "Type confusion vulnerability.",
      "Lack of proper handling of object type conversions during on-stack replacement (OSR)."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary reading and writing of objects, potentially leading to an exploitable crash, memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting malicious JavaScript code that exploits the type confusion in the IonMonkey JIT compiler.",
       "Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by entering a constructor function via on-stack replacement (OSR)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute Javascript code. A web page or a similar environment is sufficient."
