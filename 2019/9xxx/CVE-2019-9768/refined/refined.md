Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9768:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the limited variation in size, metadata, and timestamp of Thinkst Canarytokens embedded in Microsoft Word documents. This lack of variability allows attackers to easily identify files that likely contain a Canarytoken.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Characteristics:** The consistent size, metadata, and timestamp of the generated Word documents containing Canarytokens make them distinguishable from regular documents.
- **Detection Bypass:** Opening the document with Protected View in Microsoft Word or with LibreOffice Writer allows viewing the document content without triggering the CanaryToken.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Detection Avoidance:** Attackers can determine if a Word document contains a Canarytoken, enabling them to bypass the intended detection mechanism and potentially avoiding triggering alerts.
- **Undermined Security:** The effectiveness of Canarytokens as a security measure is significantly reduced if attackers can reliably identify and neutralize them before they trigger an alert.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (CVSS:3.0/AV:N):** An attacker can deliver the specially crafted Word documents via network channels.
- **File Analysis:** The attacker analyzes the document's metadata and file size to predict the presence of a canary token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Document:** The attacker must have access to a Word document containing a Canarytoken. This could be achieved through various methods like intercepting network traffic, phishing, or accessing a compromised file system.
- **Technical Proficiency:** The attacker must possess a basic level of technical skills to analyze the file's properties (size, metadata, timestamp) and understand that it may contain a canary token.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code shows a PHP script that extracts file metadata to check if a document contains a Canarytoken based on specific keywords and file size.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "High" severity with a CVSS score of 7.5
- The exploit is tagged as "dos," which is misleading. It's not a denial of service. It's a bypass of the canary token detection mechanism.
- The Exploit-DB entry indicates that the vulnerability was reported by Benjamin Zink Loft and Gionathan Reale.
- The Github issue report indicates that the vulnerability was reported to Thinkst by Gionathan Reale.
