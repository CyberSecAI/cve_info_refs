- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the failure of the `parserIfLabel()` function in `inc/zzz_template.php` to properly filter input, allowing attackers to insert dynamic PHP code into template files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Dynamic code evaluation vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the template parsing logic.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and server.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1.  An authenticated attacker with access to the admin panel can edit template files and insert malicious PHP code.
    2. The description mentions a future exploit using CSRF to gain control without admin access, but details are not provided in the current content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Initially, the attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to access and edit the template files.
    - The attacker needs the ability to make POST requests to the server, specifically to the page associated with the edited template file.
