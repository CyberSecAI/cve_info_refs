- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `create` function in `com/ofsoft/cms/admin/controller/system/SystemGenerateController.java` directly uses user-supplied input (`sql` parameter) in a database update operation without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection as it allows unvalidated user input to be incorporated into SQL queries executed on the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In this specific example, the attacker is shown modifying the `api_url` field but, more broadly, an attacker can potentially gain control of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `sql` parameter to the vulnerable endpoint (`/admin/system/generate/create`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the admin panel of the OFCMS application to access the vulnerable endpoint.
