Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-9581

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension validation within the "Look and Feel" section of the Booked Scheduler's management panel, specifically during favicon uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application lacks proper validation of the file extension when uploading a favicon file. This allows an attacker to upload a file with any extension, including executable PHP files.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
- **CSRF Token Bypass:** The exploit utilizes a CSRF token, which suggests a potential lack of proper CSRF protection, even though it's not the primary vulnerability.
- **Insecure File Storage:** Uploaded favicon files are saved in the web root directory under a predictable name "custom-favicon.php" allowing for direct access to the malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain complete control of the web server by executing arbitrary code.
- The attacker can potentially access sensitive data, modify website content, and launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Authentication:** The attacker must first authenticate to the application's admin panel using valid credentials.
2. **File Upload:** The attacker navigates to the "Look and Feel" section and uploads a malicious PHP file through the favicon upload field.
3. **Code Execution:** The attacker then requests the uploaded malicious PHP file to execute the injected code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Access:** The attacker must have valid admin credentials to log in to the Booked Scheduler instance.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Booked Scheduler web application.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with web application vulnerabilities, file uploads and php code execution.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Metasploit module automates the exploitation process.
- The vulnerability is present in Booked Scheduler version 2.7.5.
- The vendor has provided a fix for this vulnerability by adding proper extension validation to the favicon upload functionality.
