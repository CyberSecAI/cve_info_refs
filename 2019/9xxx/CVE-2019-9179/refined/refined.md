Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way GitLab handles email notifications when an issue is moved between projects. Specifically, the email notification sent to subscribers includes a link to the moved issue. This link reveals the full path of the new project, even if the project is private, when the subscriber hovers over or clicks the issue title link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of private project paths to unauthorized users (issue subscribers) through email notifications.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to prevent the exposure of private project information to users who are not supposed to know about the existence or location of the project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Private Projects:** The most significant impact is that the existence and path of private projects within a private group can be revealed to users who are merely subscribed to a related issue in a public project.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowing the existence and path of a private project may enable an attacker to attempt further unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Notifications:** The attack vector is through email notifications sent to issue subscribers when the subscribed issue is moved to another project.
*   **Issue Movement:** Moving an issue from a public to a private project triggers the vulnerable email notification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Issue Subscription:** The attacker needs to be a subscriber to an issue within a public project.
*   **Issue Movement Trigger:**  A user with sufficient permissions (reporter/admin) must move the subscribed issue to a private project under a private group.
*   **No Project Membership Required:** The attacker does not need to be a member of the private project to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary**

The vulnerability lies in the way GitLab sends out email notifications when an issue is moved.  The email exposes the path of the new project via the issue title link, even if the project is private, to issue subscribers who don't otherwise have access to that information.
