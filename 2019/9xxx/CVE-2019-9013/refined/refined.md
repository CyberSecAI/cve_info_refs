- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User credentials for the CODESYS Control runtime system are insufficiently protected during transport when not using TLS encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User credentials are sent without adequate protection in the online communication when TLS is not used.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can intercept and obtain user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the programmable logic controller (PLC), allowing for malicious code execution or disruption of the machine/system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs access to the online communication traffic of the CODESYS Control runtime system, or local access to the PLC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to eavesdrop on network traffic or have local access to the PLC. Low skill level is sufficient to exploit.
