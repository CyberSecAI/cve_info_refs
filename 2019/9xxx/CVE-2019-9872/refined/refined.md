The provided content is a security bulletin from JetBrains, and it does contain information about CVE-2019-9872.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the application server configuration within IntelliJ IDEA which allowed for the storage of secrets in cleartext format.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the cleartext storage of sensitive information such as passwords or API keys. This exposes the stored secrets to unauthorized access if an attacker gains access to the configuration files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** If exploited, an attacker could gain access to sensitive information (secrets) stored within the application server configuration, leading to potential unauthorized access to connected services or resources and further compromise of the system or accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves accessing the application server configuration files where secrets are stored without proper encryption.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to gain access to the configuration files of the affected IntelliJ IDEA application server setups. This could involve local file system access or potentially access through other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
