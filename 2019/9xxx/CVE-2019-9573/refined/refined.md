Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is missing server-side authorization checks in the WP Human Resource Management (hrm) WordPress plugin. This allows unauthorized users to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Any logged-in user can create new leave requests and modify the status of any leave (approving, canceling, etc.) by directly accessing the relevant action/functionality. This is due to a lack of proper role-based access control.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The plugin fails to verify if the user initiating the action (e.g., modifying leave status) has the necessary permissions to do so. This is further compounded by the lack of proper role validation during action execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Leave Management:** Any user (including low-privileged roles like "Subscriber") can create leave requests for any other user. They can also approve, cancel, or otherwise modify the status of any leave record.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The ability to modify leave statuses arbitrarily can lead to inaccurate record-keeping, potential disruption of employee schedules, and manipulation of employee time-off data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Exploitation occurs by crafting HTTP requests to the plugin's backend that directly trigger the vulnerable actions.
*   **Plugin API Abuse:** The plugin's API endpoints that handle leave management are directly accessed by attackers.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Validation:** The server-side code doesn't validate the user's role before performing actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the WordPress site. No elevated privileges are required.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Functionality:** Attacker needs to know the plugin's actions, endpoints, and parameters to craft the malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also mentions CVE-2019-9574, but the focus of the provided information for CVE-2019-9573 is related to unauthorized access to the ability to create and change leave statuses.
*   The recommendation provided by the reporter is to implement authorization checks based on a whitelist of roles allowed to call specific actions. It is further recommended to define roles for all actions with secure default (e.g., admin only) and to ensure that password hashes are not printed to any user.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.2.6 of the plugin.
