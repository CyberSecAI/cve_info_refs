- Presence of development scripts in the firmware that enable custom firmware uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can upload their own malicious firmware to the device. This custom firmware could be used to:
  - Intercept or modify network traffic.
  - Spoof or intercept GPS data.
  - Exfiltrate private data.
  - Hide a backdoor for persistent access.
  - Cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
Local network access is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An unauthenticated, local attacker with access to the device's network is required to upload the malicious firmware.
