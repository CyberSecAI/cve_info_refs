  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2019-9584",
    "description": "eQ-3 Homematic AddOn 'CloudMatic' on CCU2 and CCU3 allows uncontrolled admin access, resulting in the ability to obtain VPN profile details, shutting down the VPN service and to delete the VPN service configuration. This is related to improper access control for all /addons/mh/ pages",
    "root_cause": "Improper access control for all /addons/mh/ pages of the 'CloudMatic' AddOn on eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3 devices.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-284: Improper Access Control"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface can:\n  - Obtain VPN profile details, including usernames potentially linked to individuals.\n  - Delete VPN service configurations, causing a denial of service.\n  - Shut down the VPN service, reverse proxy, and CloudMatic monitoring service, causing a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending HTTP requests to specific CGI scripts under the /addons/mh/ directory.",
      "Specific vulnerable CGI scripts include: dotest2.cgi, cleanup.cgi, dienstaus.cgi, dienstausngx.cgi, and dienstauszbx.cgi"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Unauthenticated network access to the web interface of the affected CCU2 or CCU3 devices. This could be local access, or remote access via NAT if source IP is replaced by the router.",
    "additional_info": "A workaround was implemented in CCU3 firmware version 3.53.26 that checks if the source IP is within a private network range. This mitigates the vulnerability if the web interface is not exposed to the public internet without proper authentication. However, the vulnerability is still exploitable via local network access or if the source IP is replaced by NAT. There is no patch for CCU2."
