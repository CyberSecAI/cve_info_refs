```
{
  "CVE-2019-9154": {
    "root_cause": "OpenPGP.js does not distinguish between hashed and unhashed signature subpackets. When parsing a signature packet, the signed information is parsed first. When the unhashed packets are read, the information from the hashed packets is overwritten.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application trusts information in unhashed subpackets, which are not cryptographically protected."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could arbitrarily modify the contents of a key certification or revocation signature, potentially convincing a victim to use an obsolete key for encryption.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can modify unhashed subpackets within a PGP signature.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft or modify PGP messages with manipulated unhashed subpackets."
  }
