# CVE-2019-12210

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-12209.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-12211.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12210 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12210)

#### Description

In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug\_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.

As described in [part one](/posts/yubico-libu2f-host-vuln-part1/), I discovered in late 2018 through manual code analysis that the Yubico [libu2f-host](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/) host-side C library contained an **out of bounds write vulnerability**.

Shortly after the fix was released in February 2019, I found a second, closely related vulnerability in the same code section which can result in **information disclosure** through leaked memory. MITRE assigned **CVE-2019-9578** for this issue.

## The vulnerability

Please see the previous code descriptions in [part one](/posts/yubico-libu2f-host-vuln-part1/) for the relevant background information.

After the 1.1.7 patch, the relevant part of `init_device` looked like this:

```
if (u2fh_sendrecv
    (devs, dev->id, U2FHID_INIT, nonce, sizeof (nonce), resp,
     &resplen) == U2FH_OK)
  {
    U2FHID_INIT_RESP initresp;
    if (resplen > sizeof (initresp))
    {
      return U2FH_MEMORY_ERROR;
    }
    memcpy (&initresp, resp, resplen);
    dev->cid = initresp.cid;
    dev->versionInterface = initresp.versionInterface;
    dev->versionMajor = initresp.versionMajor;
    dev->versionMinor = initresp.versionMinor;
    dev->capFlags = initresp.capFlags;
  }
```

[devs.c](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/4d490bb2c528c351e32837fcdaebd998eb5d3f27/u2f-host/devs.c#L245-L260)

The `if (resplen > sizeof (initresp))` guard condition prevents malicious inputs from overflowing the target struct by disallowing larger `resplen` values. This resolves the buffer overflow.

However, this code still allows a malicious U2F token to specify a **smaller** than expected `resplen` value.

If `resplen` is reported to be `0` by the token, the `memcpy` operation does not do anything and the `initresp` struct is used with its **original uninitialized** memory contents. As a consequence, previously discarded stack memory is written to `dev->cid` and other fields.

Since the `CID` is used during the following communication with the U2F token, **four bytes** of discarded stack memory are leaked to the USB bus. Similarly, other userspace programs might be able to obtain up to **four bytes** of leaked information via the version and capability fields exposed by the library.

### Attack scenario and security implications

Similar to the previous vulnerability, the attack applies to host systems which use of libu2f-host through

* an authentication module like **pam\_u2f.so** (*privileged execution*)
* other userspace applications that depend on libu2f-host such as **yubikey-manager**
* the **command-line tool** bundled with libu2f-host

Any malicious USB device which enumerates as a recognized U2F token class can perform this attack (*potentially repeatedly*) to obtain discarded memory contents. libu2f-host versions before 1.1.7 are affected as well.

It is difficult to assess the exact practical impact of the leaked memory since the relevant memory contents are system- and execution-specific. To my knowledge, the information leak cannot be used to read into currently reserved memory such as the value of stack canaries, so it does not weaken protections that are relevant to the previously reported buffer overflow vulnerability.

#### CVSS score

I would rate this with a [CVSSv3 score of 2.1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) via *AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N*.

#### Mitigations

Stack canaries and other hardening techniques do not detect information leaks and therefore offer no meaningful protection.
The use of [Memory Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html) would detect and prevent the leaks, but Memory Sanitizer is not meant to be included as a hardening feature in production binaries.

#### Fingerprinting

As noted in the previous article, libu2f-host used a fixed ânonceâ of `{ 0x8, 0x7, 0x6, 0x5, 0x4, 0x3, 0x2, 0x1 }` to communicate with tokens, which gave tokens an excellent way to recognize the library. [The fix](https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/commit/2892b9c15f7c1c84691013bdcb388001298391b3) briefly missed the 1.1.7 release, so the fingerprinting technique is still relevant for the information leak as well.

The nonce issue was fixed with the 1.1.8 release.

## Responsible disclosure

I responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to Yubico in February.

Due to the lower severity, they did not issue a second security advisory. They agreed to track it with a second CVE, which I requested from MITRE. MITRE assigned [CVE-2019-9578](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9578) for the issue.

The fix was shipped less than two weeks after the initial disclosure, which is a very decent time for an issue resolution.

# CVE-2019-12209

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-12207.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-12210.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-12209 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12209)

#### Description

Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f\_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and does not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other files on the system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the PAM configuration, part of the file contents of a symlink target will be logged, possibly revealing sensitive information.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1135729#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-21 08:51:16 UTC  ``` Split-off from audit [bug 1087061](show_bug.cgi?id=1087061 "RESOLVED FIXED - AUDIT-0: pam_u2f: Whitelist PAM module"): This issue is for tracking the following of symlinks in the user's home directory for the auth_file:  ```     the file `$HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys` is blindly followed by the     pam module. It can be a symlink pointing to an arbitrary file. The PAM     module only rejects non- regular files and files owned by other users     than root or the to-be- authenticated user. Even these checks are only     made after open()ing the file, which may already trigger certain logic     in the kernel that is otherwise not reachable to regular users.        If `debug` is also enabled then most of the content of the file is     written either to stdout, stderr, syslog or to the defined debug     file. Therefore this can pose a big information leak to access e.g.     the contents of /etc/shadow, /root/.bash_history or similar sensitive     files.        For example use the following line in the PAM stack:        auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug        Then prepare a suitable symlink:        user$ mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico     user$ ln -s /etc/shadow ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys        Then authenticate the user on a text console:        host login: user     Password: XXX     [...]     debug(pam_u2f):  Authorization line: avahi:!:18019::::::     [...]        Notice the lines from /etc/shadow being output on the terminal. ```  This finding is still undisclosed and the publication date for this is:  CRD: 2019-06-04 ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1135729#c4)  Karol Babioch   2019-05-28 19:53:08 UTC  ``` Addressed this in SLE codestreams:  - <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193686> - <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193687>  The openSUSE codestreams will either inherit it from SLE, or will be updated/bumped once this becomes public.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1135727#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-21 08:47:35 UTC  ``` Split-off from audit [bug 1087061](show_bug.cgi?id=1087061 "RESOLVED FIXED - AUDIT-0: pam_u2f: Whitelist PAM module"): This issue is for tracking the file descriptor leak:  ``` - if the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug file   will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process. Therefore   this user can access write further information to it, possibly filling up a   file system. ```  Accessing the content of the debug file should not be possible, since the file descriptor is opened write only and Linux doesn't offer any way to change the access mode for open file descriptors.  This finding is still undisclosed and the publication date for this is:  CRD: 2019-06-04 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1135727#c2)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-05-21 08:53:18 UTC  ``` This here is a more complete description of the issue:  ```     if the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug     file will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process.     Therefore this user can manipulate the information in the debug file and     also write further information to it, possibly filling up a privileged     file system.        In some contexts the program utilizing PAM closes off leaked file     descriptors but it does work with su, for example:        Use the following line in the PAM stack:        auth    optional        pam_u2f.so debug debug_file=/tmp/u2f-debug.txt        The prepare the debug file such that the PAM module can open it:        root# touch /tmp/u2f-debug.txt        Then perform su on yourself as an unprivileged user:        user$ su user     Password: XXX     user$ ls -l /proc/$$/fd     [...]     l-wx------ 1 mgerstner users 64  8. Mai 11:44 3 -> /tmp/u2f-debug.txt        As you can see the new user shell now has an open file handle for the     debug file. ``` ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1135727#c5)  Karol Babioch   2019-05-28 19:53:07 UTC  ``` Addressed this in SLE codestreams:  - <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193686> - <https://build.suse.de/request/show/193687>  The openSUSE codestreams will either inherit it from SLE, or will be updated/bumped once this becomes public.
