Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2019-9578:

*   **Vulnerability:** The Yubico libu2f-host library before version 1.1.8 has a flaw in `devs.c` where the response to the init command is misparsed, resulting in a leak of uninitialized stack memory back to the device.
    *   Specifically, if the U2F token reports a `resplen` value of 0, the `memcpy` operation is skipped, and the `initresp` struct retains its original uninitialized memory. This uninitialized data is then written to `dev->cid` and other fields.

*   **Root Cause:** Improper parsing of the init response in `devs.c` leads to the use of uninitialized stack memory.

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious USB device enumerating as a U2F token can exploit this vulnerability.

*   **Impact:** The vulnerability can lead to information disclosure:
    *   Four bytes of discarded stack memory are leaked to the USB bus via the `CID`.
    *   Other userspace programs can potentially obtain up to four bytes of leaked information through the version and capability fields exposed by the library.

*   **Affected Systems:**
    *   Systems using libu2f-host through authentication modules like `pam_u2f.so`.
    *   Userspace applications that depend on libu2f-host, such as `yubikey-manager`.
    *   The command-line tool bundled with libu2f-host.

*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to libu2f-host version 1.1.8 or later.

*   **CVSS Score:** A CVSSv3 score of 2.1 (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) is suggested.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** A malicious USB device which enumerates as a recognized U2F token class.
