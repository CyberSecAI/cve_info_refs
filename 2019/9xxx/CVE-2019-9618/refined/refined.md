Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ajax_controller.php` file of the GraceMedia Media Player WordPress plugin.
*   The plugin uses the `require_once()` function with the value of the `cfg` parameter from the GET request without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The lack of sanitization on the `cfg` parameter allows an attacker to include local files on the server. This can be achieved by manipulating the `cfg` parameter to point to a file outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidential Data Leakage:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially exposing user credentials or other confidential information.
*   **Public Defacement:** By including arbitrary files, an attacker could potentially manipulate the content displayed on the website.
*   **Database Server Compromise:** The ability to read server configuration files could lead to the compromise of the database server, if credentials for the database server are stored in readable files.
*   **Client System Compromise:** By injecting malicious code through file inclusion, the attacker might be able to compromise client systems that interact with the vulnerable plugin.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted GET request to the `ajax_controller.php` file with a malicious `cfg` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable WordPress plugin is installed.
*   **Knowledge of Plugin Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable plugin directory (`/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/gracemedia-media-player/`) and the vulnerable file (`templates/files/ajax_controller.php`).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in version 1.0 of the GraceMedia Media Player plugin.
*   The plugin was closed and is not available for download because of this security issue.
*   Disabling the plugin is not sufficient to mitigate the vulnerability. The plugin must be deleted.
*   The vendor did not respond to two requests to fix the vulnerability, leading to public disclosure.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7/10.
