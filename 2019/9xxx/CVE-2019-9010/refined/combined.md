Advisory 2019-02

1  Affected Products

All variants of the following CODESYS V3 products in all versions prior V3.5.14.20 containing the CmpGateway
component are affected, regardless of the CPU type or operating system:
• CODESYS Control for BeagleBone
• CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6
• CODESYS Control for IOT2000
• CODESYS Control for Linux
• CODESYS Control for PFC100
• CODESYS Control for PFC200
• CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi
• CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit
• CODESYS Gateway V3
• CODESYS V3 Development System

2  Vulnerability overview

2.1  Type

Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Unverified Ownership

2.2  Management Summary

The CODESYS Gateway - standalone or part of the affected products - does not correctly verify the ownership
of a communication channel. The successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to close
existing communication channels or to take over an already established user session to send crafted packets to
a PLC.

2.3  References

CVE: CVE-2019-9010 [6]

ICS-CERT: ICSA-19-213-03 [8]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-65123, CDS-65124, CDS-65655, CDS-65656

2.4  Severity Rating

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has rated this vulnerability as critical.

The CVSS v3.0 base score of 9.0 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). [7]

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Gateway routes the online communication between clients like the CODESYS Development
System and CODESYS Control runtime systems. As optional component of CODESYS Control runtime systems
the CmpGateway may also run on PLC devices.

The CODESYS Gateway does not use adequate random values to identify the communication channel and
insufficiently verifies the ownership of a channel. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an
attacker to close existing communication channels. If the channel was not secured by encrypted
communication, an attacker may also send crafted packages to a PLC within an already established user
session.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with medium skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

4  Available software updates

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has released versions V3.5.14.20 and V3.5.15.0. Each of them solves the
noted vulnerability issue.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

5  Further References

See also Advisory 2019-03 for another CODESYS Gateway vulnerability.

6  Mitigation

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerability.

In case the software update is not applied, at least the online communication to a CODESYS Control runtime
system should be encrypted wherever possible to prevent an attacker from taking over the channel. Depending
on the PLC runtime system, these features can be activated by the user or only by the control manufacturer.
Further information on how to activate encrypted communication and user management can be found in the
CODESYS online help.

As part of a security strategy, 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH recommends the following general defense
measures to reduce the risk of exploits:
• Conduct or reinforce security awareness training for users
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
