### Summary of CVE-2019-9010
The CODESYS Gateway, present in various CODESYS V3 products, is vulnerable due to the use of insufficiently random values for identifying communication channels and inadequate verification of channel ownership.

**Affected Products:**
*   CODESYS Control for BeagleBone
*   CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6
*   CODESYS Control for IOT2000
*   CODESYS Control for Linux
*   CODESYS Control for PFC100
*   CODESYS Control for PFC200
*   CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi
*   CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit
*   CODESYS Gateway V3
*   CODESYS V3 Development System

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The CODESYS Gateway uses inadequate random values to identify communication channels and insufficiently verifies the ownership of a channel.
*   **Weakness:** Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Unverified Ownership
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote exploitation is possible.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker with medium skills is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to:
    *   Close existing communication channels.
    *   If the channel is not secured by encrypted communication, send crafted packets to a PLC within an already established user session.
*   **Severity:** Critical. CVSS v3.0 base score of 9.0 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Mitigation:**

*   Update to versions V3.5.14.20 and V3.5.15.0 or later.
*   Encrypt online communication to a CODESYS Control runtime system to prevent an attacker from taking over the channel.
*   Implement general defense measures such as security awareness training, firewalls, VPNs, user management, physical access control, and up-to-date virus detection solutions.
