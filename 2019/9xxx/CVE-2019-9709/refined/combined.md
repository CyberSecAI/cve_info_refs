## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

Message for the forum announcement:

Cross site scription of collection title on SmartEvidence overview page

Severity: High
 Vulnerability type: XSS

An issue was discovered in Mahara 17.10 before 17.10.8, 18.04 before 18.04.4, and 18.10 before 18.10.1. The collection title is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) due to not escaping it when viewing the collection's SmartEvidence overview page (if that feature is turned on). This can be exploited by any logged-in user.

### Bug Description

This is an oversight in the collection nav system when we added smart evidence and have collection nav display on the matrix page. The collection name is not being escaped.

To test:

1) Have smart evidence turned on for an institution

2) Create a collection and give it a title/name like: <script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

3) Add pages to the collection

4) Make sure to assign a SmartEvidence option to the collection

5) Visit the collection matrix page - you should get an alert pop-up displaying

We just need to escape the collection title before passing it to the collectionnav.tpl

Thanks to Kirtikumar Anandrao Ramchandani for reporting it.

### Bug Description

This is an oversight in the collection nav system when we added smart evidence and have collection nav display on the matrix page. The collection name is not being escaped.

To test:

1) Have smart evidence turned on for an institution

2) Create a collection and give it a title/name like: <script>alert(document.cookie);</script>

3) Add pages to the collection

4) Make sure to assign a SmartEvidence option to the collection

5) Visit the collection matrix page - you should get an alert pop-up displaying

We just need to escape the collection title before passing it to the collectionnav.tpl

Thanks to Kirtikumar Anandrao Ramchandani for reporting it.

Vulnerability type: XSS

An issue was discovered in Mahara 17.10 before 17.10.8, 18.04 before 18.04.4, and 18.10 before 18.10.1. The collection title is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) due to not escaping it when viewing the collection's SmartEvidence overview page (if that feature is turned on).

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.
