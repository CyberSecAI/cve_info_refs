  "CVE-2019-9811": {
    "description": "The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally. Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of integrity checks when the Mozilla Maintenance Service updates a Firefox installation located in a user-writable location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Installation to user-writable location.",
      "Lack of integrity checks for Mozilla Maintenance Service updates.",
	  "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation if a malicious maintenance service executable is placed in the unprotected install location and executed during an update.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local system access.",
      "Manipulation of Mozilla Maintenance Service."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local system access on a Windows machine.",
	  "Ability to write to the Firefox install directory"
    ]
