Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9658:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2019-9658. The descriptions from the Fedora Project and the Checkstyle GitHub issue explicitly mention "CVE-2019-9658" and detail the vulnerability involving the loading of external DTDs.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the default behavior of Checkstyle to load external Document Type Definitions (DTDs). This was considered a security issue, particularly when DTDs were hosted on insecure (non-HTTPS) servers.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insecure External DTD Loading:** Checkstyle, by default, attempted to load external DTDs, which could be hosted on HTTP servers (e.g., `http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/`). This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to serve malicious DTDs to a user of checkstyle.
-   **Dependency on Unsecured Resources:** Older versions of checkstyle relied on DTD files hosted on `http://` locations, exposing users to potential attacks.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** A malicious DTD could potentially be crafted to execute arbitrary code on the system running checkstyle. This depends on the XML parser used and whether it's vulnerable to DTD-related attacks (e.g., XXE).
-   **Configuration injection**: loading external DTD allows to influence checkstyle configuration.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the user and the insecure server hosting DTDs could intercept the request and serve a malicious DTD instead.
-   **Compromised Server:** An attacker who gains control of the server hosting DTD files could modify the DTD to inject malicious code.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Position:** To perform a MitM attack, an attacker would need to be on the same network as the victim or have the ability to intercept network traffic.
-   **Server Access:** To modify the DTD files directly, an attacker would need to gain unauthorized access to the server hosting the DTDs.

**Additional details from the content:**

-   The fix involves disabling the loading of external DTDs by default.
-   Users can re-enable the loading by setting the system property `checkstyle.enableExternalDtdLoad=true`.
-   The resolution required moving DTDs from HTTP locations to HTTPS locations (`https://checkstyle.org/dtds/`).
-   Upgrading Checkstyle is the primary way to mitigate this vulnerability.
-   The issue was addressed in Checkstyle version 8.18 and later.
