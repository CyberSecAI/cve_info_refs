RELATED: CVE-2019-9616

The provided content describes a file upload vulnerability in OFCMS versions prior to v1.1.3.

Vulnerability Details:
* Vulnerability: Unrestricted file upload in the uploadScrawl function.
* Root Cause: The uploadScrawl method in com/ofsoft/cms/admin/controller/UeditorAction.java does not properly validate uploaded files. Specifically, the isSafeFile method only checks if the filename ends with ".jsp" or ".jspx", which can be easily bypassed.
* Attack Vector: An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including executable code like JSP files, by bypassing the filename extension check.
* Impact: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
* Exploitability: Easy. The provided HTML form and Burpsuite modification steps make exploitation straightforward. Truncation techniques ($DATA on Windows) can be used to bypass the filename extension check.
* Affected Component: OFCMS UeditorAction.java (uploadScrawl method)
* Affected versions: < v1.1.3
* Required Capabilities: Attacker needs to be able to submit files to the uploadScrawl endpoint, which requires access to the admin interface.
