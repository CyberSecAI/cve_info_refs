Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `TailLogs.jsp` administration tool of the Gemalto (Thales Group) DS3 Authentication Server / Ezio Server. Specifically, the `LOG_TYPE` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to manipulate it to read arbitrary local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Limited Local File Disclosure (LFD):** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem using the vulnerable parameter.
*   **CWE-538:** This refers to the vulnerability being classified as "File and Directory Information Exposure."

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information contained in server-side files.  In the provided example, the attacker was able to read the contents of `/etc/passwd`. Other potentially sensitive files could also be targeted.
*   **Privilege Level:** The files are accessed with the privileges of the `asadmin` user, which indicates the attacker can potentially read files that are not accessible to other less privileged users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted GET request to the `TailLogs.jsp` endpoint.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is present in the web-based administration interface of the DS3 Authentication Server/Ezio Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the web portal. The provided proof of concept indicates that this vulnerability can be exploited by a user with admin privileges ("dsssAdmin" group).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the server's web interface over the network.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the URL `TailLogs.jsp` and the existence of the vulnerable parameter `LOG_TYPE`.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   **Bypass:** Although the initial restriction was that the parameter cannot contain two dots (`.`) for directory traversal, the tester was able to bypass this by injecting the filename as another argument, such as `LOG_TYPE=+/etc/passwd`.
*   **Limited output:** Only the last 10 lines of the file are returned to the attacker, potentially limiting the impact but not preventing access to the file contents.

**CVSSv3:**

*   **CVSSv3 Score:** The vendor assigned a CVSSv3 base score of 5.7 (Medium).
*   **CVSSv3 Vector:** `AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor recommends upgrading to Ezio DS3 server v3.1.0.
*   It is also recommended to deploy the application in a trusted network zone and restrict access to internal secure networks.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-9157 is a medium severity vulnerability that allows authenticated users, with admin privileges, to perform limited local file disclosure due to insufficient input validation in the `LOG_TYPE` parameter of the `TailLogs.jsp` endpoint. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the server.
