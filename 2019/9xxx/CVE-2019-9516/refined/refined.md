Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-9516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how some HTTP/2 implementations handle header streams with zero-length header names and zero-length header values. These implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocations active until the session ends.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is the allocation of memory for the zero-length headers and the failure to free this memory until the session is closed. This leads to a memory leak.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By continually sending these 0-length headers an attacker can exhaust system memory resources, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Successful exploitation can lead to excessive memory consumption.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The exhaustion of resources can lead to a DoS, making the system unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP/2 requests over a network connection.
*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to exploit the vulnerability; they can be remote from the affected server.
*   **Unauthenticated (in some cases):** Some implementations are vulnerable even without requiring authentication, though in some specific cases some level of authentication/access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system that supports HTTP/2.
*   **Ability to send crafted HTTP/2 requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP/2 traffic with 0-length header names/values.

**Additional Technical Details from the Content:**

*   The attacker can optionally encode the zero-length headers using Huffman encoding to make them 1 byte or larger.
*   Some implementations hold on to allocated memory until the session is closed
*   Some servers may queue the headers, leading to excessive memory or CPU utilization.
