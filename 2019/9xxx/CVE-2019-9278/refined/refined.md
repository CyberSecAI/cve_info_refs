{
  "CVE-2019-9278": {
    "Description": "In libexif, there is a possible out of bounds write due to an integer overflow. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege in the media content provider with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow during offset and size calculations when processing EXIF tags, specifically EXIF_IFD_INTEROPERABILITY and EXIF_IFD_EXIF tags.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote escalation of privilege, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service through exhaustion of available CPU resources.",
    "Attack vectors": "Specially crafted image files with manipulated EXIF data. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a specially crafted EXIF file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Requires user interaction (e.g., user opening a specially crafted image file) and no additional execution privileges."
