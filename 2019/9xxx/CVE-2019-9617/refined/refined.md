- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `uploadFile` method within the `com/ofsoft/cms/admin/controller/UeditorAction.java` file of OFCMS. The code fails to properly validate the uploaded file's content and type, relying solely on the filename extension for security checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - **Unrestricted File Upload**: The system does not adequately validate the content or type of the uploaded file.
  - **Insufficient Filename Filtering**: The system only checks if the filename ends with ".jsp" or ".jspx". This check can be bypassed by manipulating the filename, such as truncating the filename using special characters (e.g., `$DATA` on Windows).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor can upload arbitrary files, including executable files like JSP files, leading to remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves uploading a file through the `uploadFile` method. The attacker must craft a malicious file, name it with an extension that bypasses the server-side check, and then use a specific character for truncation to achieve the final desired name of the uploaded file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable endpoint, `http://[target]/admin/ueditor/uploadFile`.
  -  The attacker needs to be able to log in to the background of the OFCMS system.
  - The attacker needs to use a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the file name during the upload process.
