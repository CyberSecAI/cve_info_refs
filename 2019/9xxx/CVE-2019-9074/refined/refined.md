The provided content confirms this description and provides additional details.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `bfd_getl32` function within the libbfd.c library. This happens when called from `pex64_get_runtime_function` in `pei-x86_64.c`.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed binary file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library.
    *   Integer overflow leading to a SEGV.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) via application crash (SEGV).
    *   Potential for disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data.
    *   Arbitrary code execution is also mentioned in the Ubuntu notice, though not directly related to the root cause of CVE-2019-9074.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Processing a specially crafted ELF file
    *   A user or automated system is tricked into processing the file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted ELF file to a system using a vulnerable version of binutils.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `libbfd.c` library within the `bfd_getl32` function, which is called by `pex64_get_runtime_function` in `pei-x86_64.c`.
*   The SUSE Bugzilla entry for this vulnerability ([1126831](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1126831)) is marked as `RESOLVED / FIXED`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in binutils versions `2.35-7.11.1` and later for most SUSE products, and `2.37-9.39.1` for others.
*   SUSE considers binutils a developer tool not intended to process untrusted input and recommends processing untrusted code with binutils on a separate system or VM.
*   Ubuntu's USN-4336-1 references CVE-2019-9074 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in their update.
*  The openSUSE security update `openSUSE-SU-2020:1790-1` includes a fix for CVE-2019-9074.
