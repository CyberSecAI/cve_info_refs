### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Ilya Karpov and Evgeniy Druzhinin from Rostelecom-Solar, and Maxim Kozhevnikov from Positive Technologies reported these vulnerabilities to Moxa.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Moxa has developed the following solutions to address the vulnerabilities:

* MB3170 Series: Download the [new firmware](https://www.moxa.com/support/product-support/software-and-documentation/search?psid=56792).

Please see [Moxa’s security advisory](https://www.moxa.com/en/support/support/security-advisory/mb3710-3180-3270-3280-3480-3660-vulnerabilities) for more information.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

###### SUMMARY

### MB3170/MB3180/MB3270/MB3280/MB3480/MB3660 Series Protocol Gateways Vulnerabilities

* Security Advisory ID: MPSA-190902
* Version: V1.0
* Release Date: Sep 25, 2019
* Reference:
  + ICS-CERT, [ICSA-20-056-01](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-056-01)
  + CVE-2019-9099, CVE-2019-9098, CVE-2019-9102, CVE-2019-9095, CVE-2019-9103, CVE-2019-9101, CVE-2019-9096, CVE-2019-9104, CVE-2019-9097

Multiple product vulnerabilities were identified in Moxa’s MB3170/MB3180/MB3270/MB3280/MB3480/MB3660 Series Protocol Gateways. In response to this, Moxa has developed related solutions to address these vulnerabilities.

| Item | Vulnerability Type | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121), CVE-2019-9099 | There were two separate issues that affected the buffer overflow in the built-in web server that allowed remote attackers to initiate a DoS attack and execute arbitrary code. |
| 2 | Integer overflow leads to a buffer overflow (CWE-680), CVE-2019-9098 | Integer overflow causes unexpected memory allocation that can lead to a buffer overflow. |
| 3 | Bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by using a token (CWE-352), CVE-2019-9102 | A predictable mechanism of generating tokens allows remote attackers to bypass the cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism. |
| 4 | Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327), CVE-2019-9095 | Sensitive information may be revealed by using a weak cryptographic algorithm with predictable variables. |
| 5 | Information exposure (CWE-200), CVE-2019-9103 | An attacker can access sensitive information and usernames via the built-in web-service without proper authorization. |
| 6 | User credentials are sent in cleartext (CWE-310), CVE-2019-9101 | Sensitive information is transmitted over some web applications in clear text. |
| 7 | Weak password requirements (CWE-521), CVE-2019-9096 | Weak password requirements may allow an attacker to gain access by using brute force. |
| 8 | Cleartext storage of sensitive information (CWE-312), CVE-2019-9104 | Sensitive information is stored in configuration files using clear text, which allows attackers to use an administrative account. |
| 9 | Denial-of-service attack (CWE-400, CWE-941), CVE-2019-9097 | The web service will become temporarily unavailable due to the fact that the attacker overloads the system and causes the service to crash. |
