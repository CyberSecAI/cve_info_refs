Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of a weak or broken cryptographic algorithm. The algorithm used has predictable variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327):** The system uses a cryptographic algorithm that is weak and has predictable variables. This makes it easier for an attacker to potentially decrypt or forge data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. An attacker could potentially decrypt sensitive data or gain access to cryptographic keys.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the network, with no user interaction required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device. No prior privileges or authentication is required.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory indicates a low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability. This suggests that the exploitation is not overly complex and can be achieved by a wide range of attackers.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-9095 is a critical vulnerability due to the exposure of sensitive information and ease of exploitation.  The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm allows an attacker to potentially compromise the confidentiality of the system.

The provided content is consistent with the official CVE description, but it provides more detail regarding the weak cryptographic algorithm used, the attack vector, and the impact of exploitation.
