A logged in user could rename previosly uploaded file to any extension. Uploading malicious file and changing it's extension to .php could lead to remote code execution.

Now files can be renamed only to extensions that are allowed for upload.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[![Ebay: From CSRF to Full Takeover Account of any user](https://hacksecproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nuovo-logo-ebay.png)](https://hacksecproject.com/?p=99)

After the Ebay Data Breach i started looking for that bug that may have been exploited from hackers to steal credentials of more that 100 million Ebay user’s account.So i focused my attention on the Ebay recovery account procedures.If you are already a Ebay user you can reset the password of your account through three procedures:

1) Email Address:An email to the registered email-address will be sent with a reset link

2)SMS: An SMS with a 4-digits PIN will be sent from Ebay to the registered phone number

3)Phone call: A phone call will be made from Ebay to reset password of the Ebay user’s account [Leggi tutto “Ebay: From CSRF to Full Takeover Account of any user”](https://hacksecproject.com/?p=99#more-99)

In this Write-Up i’ll explain how i was able to reset password and have full access to any Google user’s account that haven’t security question enabled.

This is the Bug Report i sent to Google Security Team.

I’ve found a huge bug in Gmail.I’ve found a way to have full access to a Gmail account with no victim’s interaction.This bug can be exploited if the victim hasn’t setted the security question.

[![Yahoo! SSRF/XSPA Vulnerability](https://hacksecproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yahoo.jpg)](https://hacksecproject.com/?p=73)

First of describing how i was able to find this bug, i would prefer to introduce the SSRF/XSPA Vulnerability.

An application is vulnerable to Cross Site Port Attacks if the application processes user supplied URLs and does not verify/sanitize the backend response received from remote servers before sending it back to the client. An attacker can send crafted queries to a vulnerable web application to proxy attacks to external Internet facing servers, intranet devices and the web server itself using the advertised functionality of the vulnerable web application. The responses, in certain cases, can be studied to identify service availability (port status, banners etc.) and even fetch data from remote services in unconventional ways.XSPA allows attackers to target the server [Leggi tutto “Yahoo!

While most applications require authentication to gain access to private information or to execute tasks, not every authentication method is able to provide adequate security. Negligence, ignorance, or simple understatement of security threats often result in authentication schemes that can be bypassed by simply skipping the log in page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed.

[![WhatsApp: LFD Vulnerability](https://hacksecproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/wa-.jpeg)](https://hacksecproject.com/?p=134)

Before starting to describe the issue found on WhatsApp I want to introduce the LFD Vulnerability.

The Local File Disclosure vulnerability allows an attacker to read the content of files and get important information like ftp, mysql credentials, usually exploiting a “dynamic file inclusion” mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.

This can lead to something as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the severity, it can also lead to: [Leggi tutto “WhatsApp: LFD Vulnerability”](https://hacksecproject.com/?p=134#more-134)

# PayPal Merchant Launch Site: Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

![](https://hacksecproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PayPal.jpg)

While most applications require authentication to gain access to private information or to execute tasks, not every authentication method is able to provide adequate security. Negligence, ignorance, or simple understatement of security threats often result in authentication schemes that can be bypassed by simply skipping the log in page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed.

In addition, it is often possible to bypass authentication measures by tampering with requests and tricking the application into thinking that the user is already authenticated. This can be accomplished either by modifying the given URL parameter, by manipulating the form, or by counterfeiting sessions.

In this Write-Up i’ll describe how i hacked BillMeLater’s Merchant Launch Site logging into Admin Account exploiting an Authentication Bypass Vulnerability and what this bug allowed me to do once logged in.

**Steps required to reproduce the issue:**

After some DNS-bruteforcing i found this BillMeLater’s subdomain:

<https://launch.billmelater.com>

![](https://hacksecproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo1-300x169.png)

Once clicked on “Login” i have been redirected to [https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Login/Default.aspx?returnurl=/default.aspx](https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Login/Default.aspx?returnurl=/default.aspx "https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Login/Default.aspx?returnurl=/default.aspx")

so i started playing with this URL deleting “?returnurl=/default.aspx” from the URL above.

So this is the New URL:

[https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Login/Default.aspx](https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Login/Default.aspx "https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Login/Default.aspx")

My attention was attracted by the “Login” directory so i started to manually fuzz the URL changing “Login” with “Register”

[https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Register/Default.aspx](https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Register/Default.aspx "https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Register/Default.aspx")

Once submitted the request i received a “302” Status code so the link is accessible only if logged in.

![](https://hacksecproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo2-300x169.png)

So i thought to use a Mozilla Firefox add-on called “NoRedirect” to not redirects me to the login page.

![](https://hacksecproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/photo3-300x169.png)

Now if i go to [https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Register/Default.aspx](https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Register/Default.aspx "https://launch.billmelater.com/Home/tabid/36/ctl/Register/Default.aspx") i will be logged in as Administrator and i can execute operations like if i were the Administrator.

Now the bug has been fixed and here’s a video of the process of exploiting this vulnerability:
