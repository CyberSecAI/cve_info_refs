Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2337-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.13-2+deb9u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20852 CVE-2019-5010 CVE-2019-9636 CVE-2019-9740
                 CVE-2019-9947 CVE-2019-9948 CVE-2019-10160 CVE-2019-16056
                 CVE-2019-20907

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python2.7, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language.

CVE-2018-20852

    By using a malicious server an attacker might steal cookies that are
    meant for other domains.

CVE-2019-5010

    NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname).  A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to
    locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
    a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or
    a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an
    HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740
    query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

    urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
    file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
    urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

    A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
    allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
    password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
    URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
    information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
    crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
    (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different
    host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly
    parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

    The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain
    multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and
    implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message
    could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be
    denied.

CVE-2019-20907

    Opening a crafted tar file could result in an infinite loop due to
    missing header validation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.13-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of python2.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python2.7>

Are we making this change to the deprecated legacy interface [urllib.request.URLopener().retrieve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlretrieve) too? If so I would prefer adding below test since it also now throws `IOError` that used to return a result. I guess Python 2 also has `urlretrieve` which now forbids `local_file`

Note : `urlretrieve` was untested but documented that it used to throw `NameError` (<https://bugs.python.org/issue36948>) . Please also check Windows compatibility if urlretrieve tests have to be added since I mistakenly broke two Windows buildbots in the issue.

```
self.assertRaises(urllib.request.URLopener().rertrieve, url)
```

Sorry, my test was wrong. `urlretrieve` requires a file. Maybe above urlretrieve tests can be used to just check for `local-file://` too? Change in behavior as below

Before PR :

```
cpython git:(master) ✗ touch /tmp/a.txt
cpython git:(master) ✗ ./python.exe -q
>>> import urllib.request
>>> urllib.request.URLopener().retrieve('local_file://localhost/tmp/a.txt')
sys:1: DeprecationWarning: URLopener style of invoking requests is deprecated. Use newer urlopen functions/methods

```

After PR :

```
cpython git:(master) ✗ touch /tmp/a.txt
cpython git:(master) ✗ ./python.exe -q
>>> import urllib.request
>>> urllib.request.URLopener().retrieve('local_file://localhost/tmp/a.txt')
sys:1: DeprecationWarning: URLopener style of invoking requests is deprecated. Use newer urlopen functions/methods
Traceback (most recent call last):

I didn't know URLopener().retrieve :-) My PR impacts it as well.

I added requested tests.

Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.9-2+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-14647 CVE-2019-5010 CVE-2019-9636 CVE-2019-9740
                 CVE-2019-9947 CVE-2019-9948 CVE-2019-10160
Debian Bug     : 921039 921040 924073

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language, including

CVE-2018-14647

    Python's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash
    salt during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct
    denial of service attacks against Expat by constructing an XML
    document that would cause pathological hash collisions in Expat's
    internal data structures, consuming large amounts CPU and RAM.

CVE-2019-5010

    NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname).  A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to
    locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
    a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or
    a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an
    HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740
    query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

    urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
    file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
    urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

    A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
    allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
    password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
    URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
    information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
    crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
    (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different
    host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly
    parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.9-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9635.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9637.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9636 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9636)

#### Description

Python 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2 is affected by: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly. This is fixed in: v2.7.17, v2.7.17rc1, v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1, v3.5.7, v3.5.8, v3.5.8rc1, v3.5.8rc2, v3.5.9; v3.6.10, v3.6.10rc1, v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12, v3.6.9, v3.6.9rc1; v3.7.3, v3.7.3rc1, v3.7.4, v3.7.4rc1, v3.7.4rc2, v3.7.5, v3.7.5rc1, v3.7.6, v3.7.6rc1, v3.7.7, v3.7.7rc1, v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-60a1defcd1
2019-08-05 01:40:51.313879
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python3
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 3.7.4
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Interpreter of the Python programming language
Description :
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The python3 package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with python3.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3-tkinter and python3-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "python3-" prefix.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-9bfb4a3e4b
2019-07-29 01:07:55.107448
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python3
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 3.7.4
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Interpreter of the Python programming language
Description :
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The python3 package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with python3.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3-tkinter and python3-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "python3-" prefix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| ``` The Unnecessary scheme exists in urlopen() urllib  when people would protect to read file system in HTTP request of urlopen(), they often filter like this against SSRF.  # Vulnerability PoC import urllib print urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd').read()[:30] the result is ## # User Database #  # Note t   but if we use a scheme like this, parsing URL cannot parse scheme with urlparse() this is the parsed result.

| ``` Thanks for your report. I'm having a hard time understanding your English. If I understand you correctly, your bug report is about the open_local_file() method and the surprising fact that urllib supports the local_file schema.  I agree, this looks like an implementation artefact. urllib should not expose the local_file schema. In Python 3 refuses local_file:// (tested with 3.4 to 3.7).  >>> import urllib.request >>> urllib.request.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd').read()[:30] Traceback (most recent call last):   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>   File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/urllib/request.py", line 223, in urlopen     return opener.open(url, data, timeout)   File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/urllib/request.py", line 526, in open     response = self._open(req, data)   File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/urllib/request.py", line 549, in _open     'unknown_open', req)   File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/urllib/request.py", line 504, in _call_chain     result = func(*args)   File "/usr/lib64/python3.6/urllib/request.py", line 1388, in unknown_open     raise URLError('unknown url type: %s' % type) urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error unknown url type: local_file> ``` | | | |

| ``` Christian: > I agree, this looks like an implementation artefact. urllib should not expose the local_file schema. In Python 3 refuses local_file:// (tested with 3.4 to 3.7).  I'm not sure that I understand well the issue. urllib accepts various scheme by design: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FILE, etc.  For example, file:// scheme is legit and works as expected. Python 3 example: --- import urllib.request req = urllib.request.Request('file:///etc/passwd') print(f"URL scheme: {req.type}") fp = urllib.request.urlopen(req) print(fp.read()[:30]) fp.close() ---  Output with Python 3: --- URL scheme: file b'root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bas' ---   I get a similar output with this Python 2 example: --- import urllib req = urllib.urlopen('file:///etc/passwd') print(req.read()[:30]) req.close() ---   Christian: > I agree, this looks like an implementation artefact. urllib should not expose the local_file schema.  I understand that Python 2 handles local_file://url as file://url. Ok. But is this a security issue? If you care of security, you ensure that the url scheme is HTTP or HTTPS, not only forbid FILE, no?  I'm asking because of:  Karthikeyan Singaravelan: > This issue seems to have been assigned CVE-2019-9948 (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9948>) ... ``` | | | |

| ``` The issue is not about whether "file://" schema or not.  It's about the fact that urllib on Python 2 has two schemas that allow local file access. There is the well-known "file://" schema and there is the implementation artifact "local_file://". A careful, security-minded developer knows about the file:// schema and also knows how to block it. But the "local_file://" schema is a surprising side-effect of the implementation. ``` | | | |

If, in the future someone happens to add another method starting with open to this class, we are at risk of having the same problem again.  As for the error message, it is of course a minor issue, but I don't think it is expected that "unknown_proxy://" and "something_else://" raise different exceptions, right? ``` | | | |

# Changelog[Â¶](#changelog "Permalink to this headline")

## Python 3.7.17 final[Â¶](#python-3-7-17-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2023-06-05*

### Security[Â¶](#security "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-103142](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103142): The version of OpenSSL used in our binary builds has been
  upgraded to 1.1.1u to address several CVEs.
* [gh-99889](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99889): Fixed a security in flaw in [`uu.decode()`](../library/uu.html#uu.decode "uu.decode") that could
  allow for directory traversal based on the input if no `out_file` was
  specified.
* [gh-104049](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/104049): Do not expose the local on-disk location in directory
  indexes produced by `http.client.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`.
* [gh-102153](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102153): [`urllib.parse.urlsplit()`](../library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit "urllib.parse.urlsplit") now strips leading C0
  control and space characters following the specification for URLs defined
  by WHATWG in response to CVE-2023-24329. Patch by Illia Volochii.
* [gh-101727](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101727): Updated the OpenSSL version used in Windows and macOS
  binary release builds to 1.1.1t to address CVE-2023-0286, CVE-2022-4303,
  and CVE-2022-4303 per [the OpenSSL 2023-02-07 security advisory](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt).
* [gh-101283](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101283): [`subprocess.Popen`](../library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen "subprocess.Popen") now uses a safer approach to
  find `cmd.exe` when launching with `shell=True`. Patch by Eryk Sun,
  based on a patch by Oleg Iarygin.

### Library[Â¶](#library "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-101997](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/101997): Upgrade pip wheel bundled with ensurepip (pip 23.0.1)

### Build[Â¶](#build "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-102306](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102306): Avoid GHA CI macOS test\_posix failure by using the
  appropriate macOS SDK.

### Windows[Â¶](#windows "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-100180](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100180): Update Windows installer to OpenSSL 1.1.1s

## Python 3.7.16 final[Â¶](#python-3-7-16-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2022-12-06*

### Security[Â¶](#id2 "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-100001](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100001): `python -m http.server` no longer allows terminal
  control characters sent within a garbage request to be printed to the
  stderr server log.

  This is done by changing the [`http.server`](../library/http.server.html#module-http.server "http.server: HTTP server and request handlers.")
  `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` `.log_message` method to replace control
  characters with a `\xHH` hex escape before printing.
* [gh-98433](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98433): The IDNA codec decoder used on DNS hostnames by
  [`socket`](../library/socket.html#module-socket "socket: Low-level networking interface.") or [`asyncio`](../library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") related name resolution functions no
  longer involves a quadratic algorithm. This prevents a potential CPU
  denial of service if an out-of-spec excessive length hostname involving
  bidirectional characters were decoded. Some protocols such as
  [`urllib`](../library/urllib.html#module-urllib "urllib") http `3xx` redirects potentially allow for an attacker to
  supply such a name.
* [gh-98739](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98739): Update bundled libexpat to 2.5.0
* [gh-98517](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/98517): Port XKCPâs fix for the buffer overflows in SHA-3
  (CVE-2022-37454).
* [gh-68966](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/68966): The deprecated mailcap module now refuses to inject unsafe
  text (filenames, MIME types, parameters) into shell commands. Instead of
  using such text, it will warn and act as if a match was not found (or for
  test commands, as if the test failed).

## Python 3.7.15 final[Â¶](#python-3-7-15-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2022-10-10*

### Security[Â¶](#id3 "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-97616](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97616): Fix multiplying a list by an integer (`list *= int`):
  detect the integer overflow when the new allocated length is close to the
  maximum size. Issue reported by Jordan Limor. Patch by Victor Stinner.
* [gh-97612](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97612): Fix a shell code injection vulnerability in the
  `get-remote-certificate.py` example script. The script no longer uses a
  shell to run `openssl` commands. Issue reported and initial fix by Caleb
  Shortt. Patch by Victor Stinner.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#core-and-builtins "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-96848](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96848): Fix command line parsing: reject [`-X
  int_max_str_digits`](../using/cmdline.html#id5) option with no value (invalid) when the
  [`PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS) environment variable is set to a valid
  limit. Patch by Victor Stinner.
* [gh-95778](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95778): When [`ValueError`](../library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") is raised if an integer is larger
  than the limit, mention the [`sys.set_int_max_str_digits()`](../library/sys.html#sys.set_int_max_str_digits "sys.set_int_max_str_digits") function in
  the error message. Patch by Victor Stinner.

### Library[Â¶](#id4 "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-97005](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/97005): Update bundled libexpat to 2.4.9

### Windows[Â¶](#id5 "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-96577](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/96577): Fixes a potential buffer overrun in [`msilib`](../library/msilib.html#module-msilib "msilib: Creation of Microsoft Installer files, and CAB files. (Windows)").

## Python 3.7.14 final[Â¶](#python-3-7-14-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2022-09-06*

### Security[Â¶](#id6 "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-95778](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95778): Converting between [`int`](../library/functions.html#int "int") and [`str`](../library/stdtypes.html#str "str") in bases
  other than 2 (binary), 4, 8 (octal), 16 (hexadecimal), or 32 such as base
  10 (decimal) now raises a [`ValueError`](../library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") if the number of digits in
  string form is above a limit to avoid potential denial of service attacks
  due to the algorithmic complexity. This is a mitigation for
  [CVE-2020-10735](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10735).

  This new limit can be configured or disabled by environment variable,
  command line flag, or [`sys`](../library/sys.html#module-sys "sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions.") APIs. See the [integer string
  conversion length limitation](../library/stdtypes.html#int-max-str-digits) documentation. The
  default limit is 4300 digits in string form.

  Patch by Gregory P. Smith [Google] and Christian Heimes [Red Hat] with
  feedback from Victor Stinner, Thomas Wouters, Steve Dower, Ned Deily, and
  Mark Dickinson.
* [gh-87389](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87389): [`http.server`](../library/http.server.html#module-http.server "http.server: HTTP server and request handlers."): Fix an open redirection vulnerability
  in the HTTP server when an URI path starts with `//`. Vulnerability
  discovered, and initial fix proposed, by Hamza Avvan.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id7 "Permalink to this headline")

* [gh-93065](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/93065): Fix contextvars HAMT implementation to handle iteration
  over deep trees.

  The bug was discovered and fixed by Eli Libman. See
  [MagicStack/immutables#84](https://github.com/MagicStack/immutables/issues/84) for more details.

### Library[Â¶](#id8 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-36073](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36073): Raise [`ProgrammingError`](../library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.ProgrammingError "sqlite3.ProgrammingError") instead of segfaulting
  on recursive usage of cursors in [`sqlite3`](../library/sqlite3.html#module-sqlite3 "sqlite3: A DB-API 2.0 implementation using SQLite 3.x.") converters. Patch by
  Sergey Fedoseev.

### Security[Â¶](#id15 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-44022](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=44022): [`http.client`](../library/http.client.html#module-http.client "http.client: HTTP and HTTPS protocol client (requires sockets).") now avoids infinitely reading potential HTTP
  headers after a `100 Continue` status response from the server.
* [bpo-43882](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43882): The presence of newline or tab characters in parts of a URL
  could allow some forms of attacks.

  Following the controlling specification for URLs defined by WHATWG
  [`urllib.parse()`](../library/urllib.parse.html#module-urllib.parse "urllib.parse: Parse URLs into or assemble them from components.") now removes ASCII newlines and tabs from URLs,
  preventing such attacks.
* [bpo-42988](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=42988): CVE-2021-3426: Remove the `getfile` feature of the
  [`pydoc`](../library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system.") module which could be abused to read arbitrary files on the
  disk (directory traversal vulnerability). Moreover, even source code of
  Python modules can contain sensitive data like passwords. Vulnerability
  reported by David SchwÃ¶rer.
* [bpo-43285](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43285): [`ftplib`](../library/ftplib.html#module-ftplib "ftplib: FTP protocol client (requires sockets).") no longer trusts the IP address value returned
  from the server in response to the PASV command by default. This prevents
  a malicious FTP server from using the response to probe IPv4 address and
  port combinations on the client network.

  Code that requires the former vulnerable behavior may set a
  `trust_server_pasv_ipv4_address` attribute on their [`ftplib.FTP`](../library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP "ftplib.FTP")
  instances to `True` to re-enable it.
* [bpo-43075](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=43075): Fix Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability
  in [`urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler`](../library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler "urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler"). The ReDoS-vulnerable
  regex has quadratic worst-case complexity and it allows cause a denial of
  service when identifying crafted invalid RFCs. This ReDoS issue is on the
  client side and needs remote attackers to control the HTTP server.

  declarations in XML plist files to avoid XML vulnerabilities. This should
  not affect users as entity declarations are not used in regular plist
  files.
* [bpo-40791](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=40791): Add `volatile` to the accumulator variable in
  `hmac.compare_digest`, making constant-time-defeating optimizations less
  likely.

  pathsâ (PR 16839) included in 3.7.6, inadvertently introduced a behavior
  change that broke several third-party packages relying on the original
  undefined parsing behavior. The change is reverted in 3.7.7, restoring the
  behavior of 3.7.5 and earlier releases.
* [bpo-21016](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21016): The [`pydoc`](../library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc "pydoc: Documentation generator and online help system.") and [`trace`](../library/trace.html#module-trace "trace: Trace or track Python statement execution.") modules now use the
  [`sysconfig`](../library/sysconfig.html#module-sysconfig "sysconfig: Python's configuration information") module to get the path to the Python standard library, to
  support uncommon installation path like `/usr/lib64/python3.9/` on

  for name or all options. Giovanni Lombardo contributed part of the patch.
* [bpo-39198](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=39198): If an exception were to be thrown in `Logger.isEnabledFor`
  (say, by asyncio timeouts or stopit) , the [`logging`](../library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.") global lock may not
  be released appropriately, resulting in deadlock. This change wraps that
  block of code with `try...finally` to ensure the lock is released.
* [bpo-39191](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=39191): Perform a check for running loop before starting a new task in
  `loop.run_until_complete()` to fail fast; it prevents the side effect of
  new task spawning before exception raising.

* [bpo-39142](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=39142): A change was made to logging.config.dictConfig to avoid
  converting instances of named tuples to ConvertingTuple. Itâs assumed that
  named tuples are too specialised to be treated like ordinary tuples; if a
  user of named tuples requires ConvertingTuple functionality, they will
  have to implement that themselves in their named tuple class.
* [bpo-38971](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38971): Open issue in the BPO indicated a desire to make the
  implementation of codecs.open() at parity with io.open(), which implements
  a try/except to assure file stream gets closed before an exception is
  raised.
* [bpo-39057](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=39057): `urllib.request.proxy_bypass_environment()` now ignores
  leading dots and no longer ignores a trailing newline.

### Security[Â¶](#id47 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-38945](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38945): Newline characters have been escaped when performing uu
  encoding to prevent them from overflowing into to content section of the
  encoded file. This prevents malicious or accidental modification of data
  during the decoding process.
* [bpo-37228](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37228): Due to significant security concerns, the *reuse\_address*
  parameter of [`asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint()`](../library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint "asyncio.loop.create_datagram_endpoint") is no longer
  supported. This is because of the behavior of `SO_REUSEADDR` in UDP. For
  more details, see the documentation for
  `loop.create_datagram_endpoint()`. (Contributed by Kyle Stanley, Antoine
  Pitrou, and Yury Selivanov in [bpo-37228](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37228).)

* [bpo-38379](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38379): When cyclic garbage collection (gc) runs finalizers that
  resurrect unreachable objects, the current gc run ends, without collecting
  any cyclic trash. However, the statistics reported by `collect()` and
  `get_stats()` claimed that all cyclic trash found was collected, and
  that the resurrected objects were collected. Changed the stats to report
  that none were collected.
* [bpo-35409](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35409): Ignore GeneratorExit exceptions when throwing an exception into

  [`collections.abc`](../library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers"). Still being able to import from [`collections`](../library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes")
  was marked for removal in 3.8, but has been delayed to 3.9; documentation
  and `DeprecationWarning` clarified.

  Previously, there was a race condition between the test main() function
  which replaces the protocol and the test ServerProto protocol which sends
  ANSWER once it gets HELLO. Now, only the test main() function is
  responsible to send data, ServerProto no longer sends data.
* [bpo-37531](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37531): On timeout, regrtest no longer attempts to call
  `popen.communicate()` again: it can hang until all child processes using

  output. Change also the faulthandler timeout of the main process from 1
  minute to 5 minutes, for Python slowest buildbots.

* [bpo-21131](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21131): Fix `faulthandler.register(chain=True)` stack. faulthandler
  now allocates a dedicated stack of `SIGSTKSZ*2` bytes, instead of just
  `SIGSTKSZ` bytes. Calling the previous signal handler in faulthandler
  signal handler uses more than `SIGSTKSZ` bytes of stack memory on some
  platforms.
* [bpo-34621](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34621): Fixed unpickle-ability in older Python versions (<3.7) of UUID
  objects with `is_safe` set to `SafeUUID.unknown`.
* [bpo-37738](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37738): Fix the implementation of curses `addch(str, color_pair)`:
  pass the color pair to `setcchar()`, instead of always passing 0 as the
  color pair.

  41.2.0)
* [bpo-37642](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37642): Allowed the pure Python implementation of
  [`datetime.timezone`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.timezone "datetime.timezone") to represent sub-minute offsets close to
  minimum and maximum boundaries, specifically in the ranges (23:59, 24:00)
  and (-23:59, 24:00). Patch by Ngalim Siregar
* [bpo-37491](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37491): Fix `IndexError` when parsing email headers with unexpectedly
  ending bare-quoted string value. Patch by Abhilash Raj.

  locale.\_parse\_localename.
* [bpo-37579](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37579): Return [`NotImplemented`](../library/constants.html#NotImplemented "NotImplemented") in Python implementation of
  `__eq__` for [`timedelta`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta "datetime.timedelta") and [`time`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.time "datetime.time")
  when the other object being compared is not of the same type to match C

  [`subprocess.run()`](../library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run "subprocess.run") while capturing output. If the child process spawned
  its own children or otherwise connected its stdout or stderr handles with
  another process, we could hang after the timeout was reached and our child
  was killed when attempting to read final output from the pipes.
* [bpo-37421](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37421): Fix `multiprocessing.util.get_temp_dir()` finalizer: clear
  also the âtempdirâ configuration of the current process, so next call to
  `get_temp_dir()` will create a new temporary directory, rather than
  reusing the removed temporary directory.
* [bpo-37420](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37420): [`os.sched_setaffinity()`](../library/os.html#os.sched_setaffinity "os.sched_setaffinity") now correctly handles errors that

  decompressing a FORMAT\_ALONE format file, and it doesnât have the end
  marker, sometimes the last one to dozens bytes canât be output. Patch by
  Ma Lin.
* [bpo-12144](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12144): Ensure cookies with `expires` attribute are handled in
  `CookieJar.make_cookies()`.
* [bpo-37163](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37163): [`dataclasses.replace()`](../library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.replace "dataclasses.replace") now supports the field named âobjâ.

  triggered when an email policyâs max\_line\_length is not long enough to
  include the required markup and any values in the message. Patch by Paul
  Ganssle
* [bpo-35168](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35168): [`shlex.shlex.punctuation_chars`](../library/shlex.html#shlex.shlex.punctuation_chars "shlex.shlex.punctuation_chars") is now a read-only
  property.
* [bpo-20504](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20504): Fixes a bug in [`cgi`](../library/cgi.html#module-cgi "cgi: Helpers for running Python scripts via the Common Gateway Interface.") module when a multipart/form-data
  request has no `Content-Length` header.
* [bpo-4963](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=4963): Fixed non-deterministic behavior related to mimetypes extension
  mapping and module reinitialization.

  `sys.implementation` required attributes must go through the PEP
  process.
* [bpo-30088](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30088): Documented that [`mailbox.Maildir`](../library/mailbox.html#mailbox.Maildir "mailbox.Maildir") constructor doesnât
  attempt to verify the maildir folder layout correctness. Patch by

* [bpo-38275](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38275): test\_ssl now handles disabled TLS/SSL versions better.
  OpenSSLâs crypto policy and run-time settings are recognized and tests for
  disabled versions are skipped. Tests also accept more TLS minimum\_versions
  for platforms that override OpenSSLâs default with strict settings.
* [bpo-38271](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38271): The private keys for test\_ssl were encrypted with 3DES in
  traditional PKCS#5 format. 3DES and the digest algorithm of PKCS#5 are
  blocked by some strict crypto policies. Use PKCS#8 format with AES256
  encryption instead.
* [bpo-37123](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37123): Multiprocessing test test\_mymanager() now also expects
  -SIGTERM, not only exitcode 0. BaseManager.\_finalize\_manager() sends
  SIGTERM to the manager process if it takes longer than 1 second to stop,
  which happens on slow buildbots.
* [bpo-38212](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38212): Multiprocessing tests: increase
  test\_queue\_feeder\_donot\_stop\_onexc() timeout from 1 to 60 seconds.
* [bpo-38117](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38117): Test with OpenSSL 1.1.1d
* [bpo-37805](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37805): Add tests for json.dump(â¦, skipkeys=True). Patch by Dong-hee
  Na.
* [bpo-37531](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37531): Enhance regrtest multiprocess timeout: write a message when
  killing a worker process, catch popen.kill() and popen.wait() exceptions,
  put a timeout on the second call to popen.communicate().
* [bpo-37335](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37335): Improve locale coercion tests by using codec lookup instead of
  more fragile replace().
* [bpo-37411](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37411): Fix test\_wsgiref.testEnviron() to no longer depend on the
  environment variables (donât fail if âXâ variable is set).
* [bpo-37400](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37400): Fix test\_os.test\_chown(): use os.getgroups() rather than
  grp.getgrall() to get groups. Rename also the test to test\_chown\_gid().
* [bpo-37359](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37359): Add âcleanup option to python3 -m test to remove
  `test_python_*` directories of previous failed jobs. Add âmake
  cleantestâ to run `python3 -m test --cleanup`.
* [bpo-37362](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37362): test\_gdb no longer fails if it gets an âunexpectedâ message on
  stderr: it now ignores stderr. The purpose of test\_gdb is to test that
  python-gdb.py commands work as expected, not to test gdb.
* [bpo-36919](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36919): Make `test_source_encoding.test_issue2301` implementation
  independent. The test will work now for both CPython and IronPython.
* [bpo-34720](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34720): Assert m\_state != NULL to mimic GC traversal functions that do
  not correctly handle module creation when the module state has not been
  created.
* [bpo-34347](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34347): Fix `test_utf8_mode.test_cmd_line` for AIX. Patch by M. Felt

  optional

### IDLE[Â¶](#id67 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-35379](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35379): When exiting IDLE, catch any AttributeError. One happens when
  EditorWindow.close is called twice. Printing a traceback, when IDLE is
  run from a terminal, is useless and annoying.
* [bpo-38183](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38183): To avoid problems, test\_idle ignores the user config directory.
  It no longer tries to create or access .idlerc or any files within. Users
  must run IDLE to discover problems with saving settings.
* [bpo-38077](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38077): IDLE no longer adds âargvâ to the user namespace when
  initializing it. This bug only affected 3.7.4 and 3.8.0b2 to 3.8.0b4.
* [bpo-38041](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=38041): Shell restart lines now fill the window width, always start
  with â=â, and avoid wrapping unnecessarily. The line will still wrap if
  the included file name is long relative to the width.

* [bpo-37627](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37627): Initialize the Customize Run dialog with the command line
  arguments most recently entered before. The user can optionally edit
  before submitting them.
* [bpo-33610](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33610): Fix code context not showing the correct context when first
  toggled on.
* [bpo-37530](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37530): Optimize code context to reduce unneeded background activity.
  Font and highlight changes now occur along with text changes instead of
  after a random delay.
* [bpo-27452](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27452): Cleanup `config.py` by inlining `RemoveFile` and
  simplifying the handling of `file` in `CreateConfigHandlers`.

  open without line numbers unless set otherwise in the General tab of the
  configuration dialog.
* [bpo-26806](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26806): To compensate for stack frames added by IDLE and avoid possible
  problems with low recursion limits, add 30 to limits in the user code
  execution process. Subtract 30 when reporting recursion limits to make
  this addition mostly transparent.
* [bpo-36390](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36390): Gather Format menu functions into format.py. Combine
  paragraph.py, rstrip.py, and format methods from editor.py.

## Python 3.7.4 final[Â¶](#python-3-7-4-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2019-07-08*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id69 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-37500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37500): Due to unintended side effects, revert the change introduced by
  [bpo-1875](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1875) in 3.7.4rc1 to check for syntax errors in dead conditional
  code blocks.

### Documentation[Â¶](#id70 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-37149](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37149): Replace the dead link to the Tkinter 8.5 reference by John

### Security[Â¶](#id71 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-37463](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=37463): ssl.match\_hostname() no longer accepts IPv4 addresses with
  additional text after the address and only quad-dotted notation without
  trailing whitespaces. Some inet\_aton() implementations ignore whitespace
  and all data after whitespace, e.g. â127.0.0.1 whateverâ.

  despite the missing whitespace, and a defect registered. Also missing
  trailing whitespace after encoded words is now registered as a defect.
* [bpo-33524](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33524): Fix the folding of email header when the max\_line\_length is 0

  then file permissions, since extended attributes can only be set on the
  destination while it is still writeable.
* [bpo-33110](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33110): Handle exceptions raised by functions added by
  concurrent.futures add\_done\_callback correctly when the Future has already

  by calling its `close()` method only
  when no exception is raised.
* [bpo-36650](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36650): The C version of functools.lru\_cache() was treating calls with
  an empty `**kwargs` dictionary as being distinct from calls with no

  code is executed under tracing. Patch by Karthikeyan Singaravelan.
* [bpo-36533](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36533): Reinitialize logging.Handler locks in forked child processes
  instead of attempting to acquire them all in the parent before forking
  only to be released in the child process. The acquire/release pattern was
  leading to deadlocks in code that has implemented any form of chained
  logging handlers that depend upon one another as the lock acquision order
  cannot be guaranteed.
* [bpo-36522](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36522): If *debuglevel* is set to >0 in [`http.client`](../library/http.client.html#module-http.client "http.client: HTTP and HTTPS protocol client (requires sockets)."), print all

  references
* [bpo-36321](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36321): collections.namedtuple() misspelled the name of an attribute.
  To be consistent with typing.NamedTuple, the attribute name should have
  been â\_field\_defaultsâ instead of â\_fields\_defaultsâ. For backwards
  compatibility, both spellings are now created. The misspelled version may
  be removed in the future.
* [bpo-36272](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36272): [`logging`](../library/logging.html#module-logging "logging: Flexible event logging system for applications.") does not silently ignore RecursionError anymore.

  WeakKeyDictionary or a WeakValueDictionary, due to some keys or values
  disappearing while iterating.
* [bpo-28503](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28503): The [`crypt`](../library/crypt.html#module-crypt "crypt: The crypt() function used to check Unix passwords. (Unix)") module now internally uses the `crypt_r()` library
  function instead of [`crypt()`](../library/crypt.html#module-crypt "crypt: The crypt() function used to check Unix passwords. (Unix)") when available.
* [bpo-35121](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35121): Donât set cookie for a request when the request path is a

  [`unittest.mock.create_autospec()`](../library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.create_autospec "unittest.mock.create_autospec") should propagate to the parent.
  Patch by Karthikeyan Singaravelan.
* [bpo-35513](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35513): `TextTestRunner` of
  `unittest.runner` now uses [`time.perf_counter()`](../library/time.html#time.perf_counter "time.perf_counter") rather than
  [`time.time()`](../library/time.html#time.time "time.time") to measure the execution time of a test:
  [`time.time()`](../library/time.html#time.time "time.time") can go backwards, whereas [`time.perf_counter()`](../library/time.html#time.perf_counter "time.perf_counter") is
  monotonic.
* [bpo-35502](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35502): Fixed reference leaks in
  [`xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder`](../library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder "xml.etree.ElementTree.TreeBuilder") in case of unfinished building

  function can change the content of the input buffer.
* [bpo-20239](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20239): Allow repeated assignment deletion of
  [`unittest.mock.Mock`](../library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock "unittest.mock.Mock") attributes. Patch by Pablo Galindo.

* [bpo-10496](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10496): `check_environ()` of
  `distutils.utils` now catches [`KeyError`](../library/exceptions.html#KeyError "KeyError") on calling
  [`pwd.getpwuid()`](../library/pwd.html#pwd.getpwuid "pwd.getpwuid"): donât create the `HOME` environment variable in
  this case.
* [bpo-35066](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35066): Previously, calling the strftime() method on a datetime object
  with a trailing â%â in the format string would result in an exception.
  However, this only occured when the datetime C module was being used; the
  python implementation did not match this behavior. Datetime is now PEP-399
  compliant, and will not throw an exception on a trailing â%â.
* [bpo-24746](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24746): Avoid stripping trailing whitespace in doctest fancy diff.

  (unless it is a symbolic link).
* [bpo-34572](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34572): Fix C implementation of pickle.loads to use importlibâs locking
  mechanisms, and thereby avoid using partially-loaded modules. Patch by Tim
  Burgess.
* [bpo-33687](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33687): Fix the call to `os.chmod()` for `uu.decode()` if a mode is
  given or decoded. Patch by Timo Furrer.
* [bpo-32146](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32146): Document the interaction between frozen executables and the
  spawn and forkserver start methods in multiprocessing.

### Tests[Â¶](#id91 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-36234](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36234): test\_posix.PosixUidGidTests: add tests for invalid uid/gid type
  (str). Initial patch written by David Malcolm.
* [bpo-29571](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29571): Fix `test_re.test_locale_flag()`: use
  `locale.getpreferredencoding()` rather than `locale.getlocale()` to
  get the locale encoding. With some locales, `locale.getlocale()` returns
  the wrong encoding. On Windows, set temporarily the `LC_CTYPE` locale to
  the user preferred encoding to ensure that it uses the ANSI code page, to
  be consistent with `locale.getpreferredencoding()`.
* [bpo-36123](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=36123): Fix race condition in test\_socket.

  to be supported by them. (patch by Giampaolo Rodola)
* [bpo-35772](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35772): Fix sparse file tests of test\_tarfile on ppc64 with the tmpfs
  filesystem. Fix the function testing if the filesystem supports sparse
  files: create a file which contains data and âholesâ, instead of creating
  a file which contains no data. tmpfs effective block size is a page size
  (tmpfs lives in the page cache). RHEL uses 64 KiB pages on aarch64, ppc64,
  ppc64le, only s390x and x86\_64 use 4 KiB pages, whereas the test punch
  holes of 4 KiB.

* [bpo-31731](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31731): Fix a race condition in `check_interrupted_write()` of
  test\_io: create directly the thread with SIGALRM signal blocked, rather
  than blocking the signal later from the thread. Previously, it was
  possible that the thread gets the signal before the signal is blocked.
* [bpo-35424](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35424): Fix test\_multiprocessing\_main\_handling: use
  `multiprocessing.Pool` with a context manager and then explicitly
  join the pool.
* [bpo-35519](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35519): Rename `test.bisect` module to `test.bisect_cmd` to
  avoid conflict with [`bisect`](../library/bisect.html#module-bisect "bisect: Array bisection algorithms for binary searching.") module when running directly a test like
  `./python Lib/test/test_xmlrpc.py`.
* [bpo-35513](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=35513): Replace [`time.time()`](../library/time.html#time.time "time.time") with [`time.monotonic()`](../library/time.html#time.monotonic "time.monotonic") in tests
  to measure time delta.
* [bpo-34279](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34279): [`test.support.run_unittest()`](../library/test.html#test.support.run_unittest "test.support.run_unittest") no longer raise
  `TestDidNotRun` if the test result contains skipped tests. The
  exception is now only raised if no test have been run and no test have
  been skipped.

  compiled with Python 3.6 or earlier.
* [bpo-34587](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34587): test\_socket: Remove RDSTest.testCongestion(). The test tries to
  fill the receiverâs socket buffer and expects an error. But the RDS
  protocol doesnât require that. Moreover, the Linux implementation of RDS
  expects that the producer of the messages reduces its rate, itâs not the
  role of the receiver to trigger an error. The test fails on Fedora 28 by
  design, so just remove it.
* [bpo-34661](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=34661): Fix test\_shutil if unzip doesnât support -t.

* [bpo-33635](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33635): In macOS stat on some file descriptors (/dev/fd/3 f.e) will
  result in bad file descriptor OSError. Guard against this exception was
  added in is\_dir, is\_file and similar methods. DirEntry.is\_dir can also
  throw this exception so \_RecursiveWildcardSelector.\_iterate\_directories
  was also extended with the same error ignoring pattern.

* [bpo-33975](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33975): Avoid small type when running htests. Since part of the purpose
  of human-viewed tests is to determine that widgets look right, it is
  important that they look the same for testing as when running IDLE.
* [bpo-33905](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33905): Add test for idlelib.stackview.StackBrowser.
* [bpo-33924](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33924): Change mainmenu.menudefs key âwindowsâ to âwindowâ. Every other

  documentation.
* [bpo-32056](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32056): Improved exceptions raised for invalid number of channels and
  sample width when read an audio file in modules [`aifc`](../library/aifc.html#module-aifc "aifc: Read and write audio files in AIFF or AIFC format."), [`wave`](../library/wave.html#module-wave "wave: Provide an interface to the WAV sound format.")
  and [`sunau`](../library/sunau.html#module-sunau "sunau: Provide an interface to the Sun AU sound format.").

  [`ValueError`](../library/exceptions.html#ValueError "ValueError") instead of canceling the first scheduled function.
  Patch by Cheryl Sabella.
* [bpo-31639](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31639): http.server now exposes a ThreadedHTTPServer class and uses it
  when the module is run with `-m` to cope with web browsers pre-opening
  sockets.
* [bpo-27645](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27645): [`sqlite3.Connection`](../library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection "sqlite3.Connection") now exposes a
  [`backup`](../library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.backup "sqlite3.Connection.backup") method, if the underlying SQLite
  library is at version 3.6.11 or higher. Patch by Lele Gaifax.

### Documentation[Â¶](#id156 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-33126](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33126): Document PyBuffer\_ToContiguous().
* [bpo-27212](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27212): Modify documentation for the `islice()` recipe to consume

  implements `MetaPathFinder`. (Patch by Himanshu Lakhara)

### Tests[Â¶](#id157 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32872](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32872): Avoid regrtest compatibility issue with namespace packages.
* [bpo-32517](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32517): Fix failing `test_asyncio` on macOS 10.12.2+ due to transport
  of `KqueueSelector` loop was not being closed.
* [bpo-19417](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19417): Add test\_bdb.py.

### Build[Â¶](#id158 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-33163](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33163): Upgrade pip to 9.0.3 and setuptools to v39.0.1.

### Windows[Â¶](#id159 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-33016](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=33016): Fix potential use of uninitialized memory in
  nt.\_getfinalpathname

  directory is set to a UNC path.

### macOS[Â¶](#id160 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32726](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32726): Build and link with private copy of Tcl/Tk 8.6 for the macOS
  10.6+ installer. The 10.9+ installer variant already does this. This
  means that the Python 3.7 provided by the python.org macOS installers no
  longer need or use any external versions of Tcl/Tk, either system-provided
  or user-installed, such as ActiveTcl.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id161 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32984](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32984): Set `__file__` while running a startup file. Like Python,
  IDLE optionally runs one startup file in the Shell window before
  presenting the first interactive input prompt. For IDLE, `-s` runs a
  file named in environmental variable `IDLESTARTUP` or
  [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP); `-r file` runs `file`. Python sets
  `__file__` to the startup file name before running the file and unsets
  it before the first prompt. IDLE now does the same when run normally,
  without the `-n` option.
* [bpo-32940](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32940): Simplify and rename StringTranslatePseudoMapping in pyparse.

  PySys\_ResetWarnOptions, PySys\_AddWarnOption, and PySys\_AddXOption prior to
  calling Py\_Initialize.
* [bpo-32374](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32374): Document that m\_traverse for multi-phase initialized modules
  can be called with m\_state=NULL, and add a sanity check

## Python 3.7.0 beta 2[Â¶](#python-3-7-0-beta-2 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2018-02-27*

### Security[Â¶](#id164 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-28414](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28414): The ssl module now allows users to perform their own IDN
  en/decoding when using SNI.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id165 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32889](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32889): Update Valgrind suppression list to account for the rename of
  `Py_ADDRESS_IN_RANG` to `address_in_range`.
* [bpo-31356](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31356): Remove the new API added in [bpo-31356](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31356) (gc.ensure\_disabled()
  context manager).
* [bpo-32305](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32305): For namespace packages, ensure that both `__file__` and
  `__spec__.origin` are set to None.
* [bpo-32303](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32303): Make sure `__spec__.loader` matches `__loader__` for
  namespace packages.
* [bpo-32711](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32711): Fix the warning messages for Python/ast\_unparse.c. Patch by
  StÃ©phane Wirtel
* [bpo-32583](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32583): Fix possible crashing in builtin Unicode decoders caused by
  write out-of-bound errors when using customized decode error handlers.

### Library[Â¶](#id166 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32960](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32960): For dataclasses, disallow inheriting frozen from non-frozen
  classes, and also disallow inheriting non-frozen from frozen classes. This
  restriction will be relaxed at a future date.
* [bpo-32713](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32713): Fixed tarfile.itn handling of out-of-bounds float values. Patch
  by Joffrey Fuhrer.
* [bpo-32951](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32951): Direct instantiation of SSLSocket and SSLObject objects is now
  prohibited. The constructors were never documented, tested, or designed as
  public constructors. Users were suppose to use ssl.wrap\_socket() or
  SSLContext.
* [bpo-32929](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32929): Remove the tri-state parameter âhashâ, and add the boolean
  âunsafe\_hashâ. If unsafe\_hash is True, add a \_\_hash\_\_ function, but if a
  \_\_hash\_\_ exists, raise TypeError. If unsafe\_hash is False, add a \_\_hash\_\_
  based on the values of eq= and frozen=. The unsafe\_hash=False behavior is
  the same as the old hash=None behavior. unsafe\_hash=False is the default,
  just as hash=None used to be.
* [bpo-32947](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32947): Add OP\_ENABLE\_MIDDLEBOX\_COMPAT and test workaround for TLSv1.3
  for future compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.1.
* [bpo-30622](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30622): The ssl module now detects missing NPN support in LibreSSL.
* [bpo-32922](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32922): dbm.open() now encodes filename with the filesystem encoding
  rather than default encoding.
* [bpo-32859](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32859): In `os.dup2`, donât check every call whether the `dup3`
  syscall exists or not.
* [bpo-32556](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32556): nt.\_getfinalpathname, nt.\_getvolumepathname and
  nt.\_getdiskusage now correctly convert from bytes.
* [bpo-25988](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25988): Emit a [`DeprecationWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") when using or importing an ABC
  directly from [`collections`](../library/collections.html#module-collections "collections: Container datatypes") rather than from [`collections.abc`](../library/collections.abc.html#module-collections.abc "collections.abc: Abstract base classes for containers").
* [bpo-21060](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21060): Rewrite confusing message from setup.py upload from âNo dist
  file created in earlier commandâ to the more helpful âMust create and
  upload files in one commandâ.
* [bpo-32852](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32852): Make sure sys.argv remains as a list when running trace.
* [bpo-31333](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31333): `_abc` module is added. It is a speedup module with C
  implementations for various functions and methods in `abc`. Creating an
  ABC subclass and calling `isinstance` or `issubclass` with an ABC
  subclass are up to 1.5x faster. In addition, this makes Python start-up up
  to 10% faster.

  Note that the new implementation hides internal registry and caches,
  previously accessible via private attributes `_abc_registry`,
  `_abc_cache`, and `_abc_negative_cache`. There are three debugging
  helper methods that can be used instead `_dump_registry`,
  `_abc_registry_clear`, and `_abc_caches_clear`.
* [bpo-32841](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32841): Fixed [`asyncio.Condition`](../library/asyncio-sync.html#asyncio.Condition "asyncio.Condition") issue which silently ignored
  cancellation after notifying and cancelling a conditional lock. Patch by
  Bar Harel.
* [bpo-32819](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32819): ssl.match\_hostname() has been simplified and no longer depends
  on re and ipaddress module for wildcard and IP addresses. Error reporting
  for invalid wildcards has been improved.
* [bpo-32394](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32394): socket: Remove
  TCP\_FASTOPEN,TCP\_KEEPCNT,TCP\_KEEPIDLE,TCP\_KEEPINTVL flags on older version
  Windows during run-time.
* [bpo-31787](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31787): Fixed refleaks of `__init__()` methods in various modules.
  (Contributed by Oren Milman)
* [bpo-30157](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30157): Fixed guessing quote and delimiter in csv.Sniffer.sniff() when
  only the last field is quoted. Patch by Jake Davis.
* [bpo-32792](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32792): collections.ChainMap() preserves the order of the underlying
  mappings.
* [bpo-32775](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32775): [`fnmatch.translate()`](../library/fnmatch.html#fnmatch.translate "fnmatch.translate") no longer produces patterns which
  contain set operations. Sets starting with â[â or containing âââ, â&&â,
  â~~â or â||â will be interpreted differently in regular expressions in
  future versions. Currently they emit warnings. fnmatch.translate() now
  avoids producing patterns containing such sets by accident.
* [bpo-32622](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32622): Implement native fast sendfile for Windows proactor event loop.
* [bpo-32777](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32777): Fix a rare but potential pre-exec child process deadlock in
  subprocess on POSIX systems when marking file descriptors inheritable on
  exec in the child process. This bug appears to have been introduced in
  3.4.
* [bpo-32647](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32647): The ctypes module used to depend on indirect linking for
  dlopen. The shared extension is now explicitly linked against libdl on
  platforms with dl.
* [bpo-32741](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32741): Implement `asyncio.TimerHandle.when()` method.
* [bpo-32691](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32691): Use mod\_spec.parent when running modules with pdb
* [bpo-32734](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32734): Fixed `asyncio.Lock()` safety issue which allowed acquiring
  and locking the same lock multiple times, without it being free. Patch by
  Bar Harel.
* [bpo-32727](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32727): Do not include name field in SMTP envelope from address. Patch
  by StÃ©phane Wirtel
* [bpo-31453](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31453): Add TLSVersion constants and SSLContext.maximum\_version /
  minimum\_version attributes. The new API wraps OpenSSL 1.1
  <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version.html>
  feature.
* [bpo-24334](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24334): Internal implementation details of ssl module were cleaned up.
  The SSLSocket has one less layer of indirection. Owner and session
  information are now handled by the SSLSocket and SSLObject constructor.
  Channel binding implementation has been simplified.
* [bpo-31848](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31848): Fix the error handling in Aifc\_read.initfp() when the SSND
  chunk is not found. Patch by Zackery Spytz.
* [bpo-32585](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32585): Add Ttk spinbox widget to [`tkinter.ttk`](../library/tkinter.ttk.html#module-tkinter.ttk "tkinter.ttk: Tk themed widget set"). Patch by Alan D
  Moore.
* [bpo-32221](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32221): Various functions returning tuple containing IPv6 addresses now
  omit `%scope` part since the same information is already encoded in
  *scopeid* tuple item. Especially this speeds up `socket.recvfrom()`
  when it receives multicast packet since useless resolving of network
  interface name is omitted.
* [bpo-30693](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30693): The TarFile class now recurses directories in a reproducible
  way.
* [bpo-30693](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30693): The ZipFile class now recurses directories in a reproducible
  way.

  prevent [`DeprecationWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning") and add text to REGEX HOWTO to highlight
  the deprecation.
* [bpo-31972](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31972): Improve docstrings for [`pathlib.PurePath`](../library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath "pathlib.PurePath") subclasses.

  module. Patch by Segev Finer.
* [bpo-29248](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29248): Fix [`os.readlink()`](../library/os.html#os.readlink "os.readlink") on Windows, which was mistakenly
  treating the `PrintNameOffset` field of the reparse data buffer as a
  number of characters instead of bytes. Patch by Craig Holmquist and SSE4.

  open() is a bad idea for IDLEâs system and location-independent files.
* [bpo-32826](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32826): Add âencoding=utf-8â to open() in IDLEâs test\_help\_about. GUI
  test test\_file\_buttons() only looks at initial ascii-only lines, but
  failed on systems where open() defaults to âasciiâ because readline()
  internally reads and decodes far enough ahead to encounter a non-ascii
  character in CREDITS.txt.
* [bpo-32765](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32765): Update configdialog General tab docstring to add new widgets to

* [bpo-32703](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32703): Fix coroutineâs ResourceWarning when thereâs an active error
  set when itâs being finalized.
* [bpo-32650](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32650): Pdb and other debuggers dependent on bdb.py will correctly step
  over (next command) native coroutines. Patch by Pablo Galindo.
* [bpo-28685](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28685): Optimize list.sort() and sorted() by using type specialized
  comparisons when possible.
* [bpo-32685](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32685): Improve suggestion when the Python 2 form of print statement is
  either present on the same line as the header of a compound statement or
  else terminated by a semi-colon instead of a newline. Patch by Nitish
  Chandra.
* [bpo-32697](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32697): Python now explicitly preserves the definition order of
  keyword-only parameters. Itâs always preserved their order, but this
  behavior was never guaranteed before; this behavior is now guaranteed and
  tested.
* [bpo-32690](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32690): The locals() dictionary now displays in the lexical order that
  variables were defined. Previously, the order was reversed.

  This means that manually raising a StopIteration exception from a
  generator is prohibited for all code, regardless of whether âfrom
  \_\_future\_\_ import generator\_stopâ was used or not.
* [bpo-32591](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32591): Added built-in support for tracking the origin of coroutine
  objects; see sys.set\_coroutine\_origin\_tracking\_depth and
  CoroutineType.cr\_origin. This replaces the asyncio debug modeâs use of
  coroutine wrapping for native coroutine objects.
* [bpo-31368](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31368): Expose preadv and pwritev system calls in the os module. Patch
  by Pablo Galindo
* [bpo-32544](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32544): `hasattr(obj, name)` and `getattr(obj, name, default)` are
  about 4 times faster than before when `name` is not found and `obj`
  doesnât override `__getattr__` or `__getattribute__`.
* [bpo-26163](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26163): Improved frozenset() hash to create more distinct hash values

* [bpo-18533](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18533): `repr()` on a dict containing its own `values()` or
  `items()` no longer raises `RecursionError`; OrderedDict similarly.
  Instead, use `...`, as for other recursive structures. Patch by Ben
  North.
* [bpo-20891](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20891): Py\_Initialize() now creates the GIL. The GIL is no longer
  created âon demandâ to fix a race condition when PyGILState\_Ensure() is
  called in a non-Python thread.
* [bpo-32028](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32028): Leading whitespace is now correctly ignored when generating
  suggestions for converting Py2 print statements to Py3 builtin print
  function calls. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.
* [bpo-31179](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31179): Make dict.copy() up to 5.5 times faster.
* [bpo-31113](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31113): Get rid of recursion in the compiler for normal control flow.

* [bpo-25988](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25988): Deprecate exposing the contents of collections.abc in the
  regular collections module.
* [bpo-31429](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31429): The default cipher suite selection of the ssl module now uses a
  blacklist approach rather than a hard-coded whitelist. Python no longer
  re-enables ciphers that have been blocked by OpenSSL security update.
  Default cipher suite selection can be configured on compile time.
* [bpo-30306](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30306): contextlib.contextmanager now releases the arguments passed to
  the underlying generator as soon as the context manager is entered.
  Previously it would keep them alive for as long as the context manager was
  alive, even when not being used as a function decorator. Patch by Martin
  Teichmann.
* [bpo-21417](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21417): Added support for setting the compression level for
  zipfile.ZipFile.
* [bpo-32251](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32251): Implement asyncio.BufferedProtocol (provisional API).

  `FIOCLEX`, `FIOASYNC` and `FIONBIO` also under Solaris/derivatives.
* [bpo-27931](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27931): Fix email address header parsing error when the username is an
  empty quoted string. Patch by Xiang Zhang.
* [bpo-32659](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32659): Under Solaris and derivatives, [`os.stat_result`](../library/os.html#os.stat_result "os.stat_result") provides
  a st\_fstype attribute.
* [bpo-32662](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32662): Implement Server.start\_serving(), Server.serve\_forever(), and
  Server.is\_serving() methods. Add âstart\_servingâ keyword parameter to
  loop.create\_server() and loop.create\_unix\_server().
* [bpo-32391](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32391): Implement [`asyncio.StreamWriter.wait_closed()`](../library/asyncio-stream.html#asyncio.StreamWriter.wait_closed "asyncio.StreamWriter.wait_closed") and
  [`asyncio.StreamWriter.is_closing()`](../library/asyncio-stream.html#asyncio.StreamWriter.is_closing "asyncio.StreamWriter.is_closing") methods

* [bpo-32304](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32304): distutilsâ upload command no longer corrupts tar files ending
  with a CR byte, and no longer tries to convert CR to CRLF in any of the
  upload text fields.
* [bpo-32502](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32502): uuid.uuid1 no longer raises an exception if a 64-bit hardware
  address is encountered.
* [bpo-32596](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32596): `concurrent.futures` imports `ThreadPoolExecutor` and
  `ProcessPoolExecutor` lazily (using [**PEP 562**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562)). It makes `import
  asyncio` about 15% faster because asyncio uses only
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` by default.
* [bpo-31801](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31801): Add `_ignore_` to `Enum` so temporary variables can be used
  during class construction without being turned into members.
* [bpo-32576](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32576): Use queue.SimpleQueue() in places where it can be invoked from
  a weakref callback.
* [bpo-32574](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32574): Fix memory leak in asyncio.Queue, when the queue has limited

* [bpo-25942](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25942): The subprocess module is now more graceful when handling a
  Ctrl-C KeyboardInterrupt during subprocess.call, subprocess.run, or a
  Popen context manager. It now waits a short amount of time for the child
  (presumed to have also gotten the SIGINT) to exit, before continuing the
  KeyboardInterrupt exception handling. This still includes a SIGKILL in
  the call() and run() APIs, but at least the child had a chance first.
* [bpo-32433](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32433): The hmac module now has hmac.digest(), which provides an
  optimized HMAC digest.
* [bpo-28134](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28134): Sockets now auto-detect family, type and protocol from file
  descriptor by default.
* [bpo-32404](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32404): Fix bug where [`datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp()`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp "datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp") did not
  call \_\_new\_\_ in [`datetime.datetime`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") subclasses.
* [bpo-32403](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32403): Improved speed of [`datetime.date`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.date "datetime.date") and
  [`datetime.datetime`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime "datetime.datetime") alternate constructors.
* [bpo-32228](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32228): Ensure that `truncate()` preserves the file position (as
  reported by `tell()`) after writes longer than the buffer size.
* [bpo-32410](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32410): Implement `loop.sock_sendfile` for asyncio event loop.
* [bpo-22908](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22908): Added seek and tell to the ZipExtFile class. This only works if
  the file object used to open the zipfile is seekable.
* [bpo-32373](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32373): Add socket.getblocking() method.
* [bpo-32248](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32248): Add [`importlib.resources`](../library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources "importlib.resources: Package resource reading, opening, and access") and
  [`importlib.abc.ResourceReader`](../library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.ResourceReader "importlib.abc.ResourceReader") as the unified API for reading
  resources contained within packages. Loaders wishing to support resource
  reading must implement the `get_resource_reader()` method.
  File-based and zipimport-based loaders both implement these APIs.
  [`importlib.abc.ResourceLoader`](../library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.ResourceLoader "importlib.abc.ResourceLoader") is deprecated in favor of these new
  APIs.
* [bpo-32320](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32320): collections.namedtuple() now supports default values.
* [bpo-29302](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29302): Add contextlib.AsyncExitStack. Patch by Alexander Mohr and Ilya
  Kulakov.
* [bpo-31961](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31961): *Removed in Python 3.7.0b2.* The *args* argument of
  subprocess.Popen can now be a [path-like object](../glossary.html#term-path-like-object). If *args* is given
  as a sequence, itâs first element can now be a [path-like object](../glossary.html#term-path-like-object) as
  well.
* [bpo-31900](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31900): The [`locale.localeconv()`](../library/locale.html#locale.localeconv "locale.localeconv") function now sets temporarily the
  `LC_CTYPE` locale to the `LC_NUMERIC` locale to decode
  `decimal_point` and `thousands_sep` byte strings if they are non-ASCII
  or longer than 1 byte, and the `LC_NUMERIC` locale is different than the
  `LC_CTYPE` locale. This temporary change affects other threads.

  Same change for the [`str.format()`](../library/stdtypes.html#str.format "str.format") method when formatting a number
  ([`int`](../library/functions.html#int "int"), [`float`](../library/functions.html#float "float"), [`float`](../library/functions.html#float "float") and subclasses) with the
  `n` type (ex: `'{:n}'.format(1234)`).
* [bpo-31853](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31853): Use super().method instead of socket.method in SSLSocket. They
  were there most likely for legacy reasons.
* [bpo-31399](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31399): The ssl module now uses OpenSSLâs X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_host()
  and X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_ip() API to verify hostname and IP addresses.
  Subject common name fallback can be disabled with
  SSLContext.hostname\_checks\_common\_name.
* [bpo-14976](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=14976): Add a queue.SimpleQueue class, an unbounded FIFO queue with a
  reentrant C implementation of put().

  internationalized host names are working since [bpo-31399](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31399) has landed. IDNA
  2008 are still broken.
* [bpo-32604](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32604): Add a new â\_xxsubinterpretersâ extension module that exposes
  the existing subinterpreter C-API and a new cross-interpreter data sharing
  mechanism. The module is primarily intended for more thorough testing of
  the existing subinterpreter support.

  Note that the \_xxsubinterpreters module has been removed in 3.7.0rc1.
* [bpo-32602](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32602): Add test certs and test for ECDSA cert and EC/RSA dual mode.

  instead of libcrypt at the system.
* [bpo-32598](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32598): Use autoconf to detect OpenSSL libs, headers and supported
  features. The ax\_check\_openssl M4 macro uses pkg-config to locate OpenSSL
  and falls back to manual search.
* [bpo-32593](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32593): Drop support of FreeBSD 9 and older.
* [bpo-29708](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29708): If the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable is set,
  [`py_compile`](../library/py_compile.html#module-py_compile "py_compile: Generate byte-code files from Python source files.") will always create hash-based `.pyc` files.

### Windows[Â¶](#id179 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32507](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32507): Use app-local UCRT install rather than the proper update for
  old versions of Windows.

### macOS[Â¶](#id180 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32726](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32726): Provide an additional, more modern macOS installer variant that
  supports macOS 10.9+ systems in 64-bit mode only. Upgrade the supplied
  third-party libraries to OpenSSL 1.1.0g and to SQLite 3.22.0. The 10.9+
  installer now links with and supplies its own copy of Tcl/Tk 8.6.
* [bpo-28440](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28440): No longer add /Library/Python/3.x/site-packages to sys.path for
  macOS framework builds to avoid future conflicts.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id182 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31975](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31975): The default warning filter list now starts with a
  âdefault::DeprecationWarning:\_\_main\_\_â entry, so deprecation warnings are
  once again shown by default in single-file scripts and at the interactive
  prompt.
* [bpo-32226](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32226): `__class_getitem__` is now an automatic class method.

  non-iterable is now more specific.
* [bpo-27169](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27169): The `__debug__` constant is now optimized out at compile
  time. This fixes also [bpo-22091](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22091).
* [bpo-32329](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32329): The [`-R`](../using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-r) option now turns on hash randomization when
  the [`PYTHONHASHSEED`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED) environment variable is set to `0`.
  Previously, the option was ignored. Moreover,
  `sys.flags.hash_randomization` is now properly set to 0 when hash
  randomization is turned off by `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`.
* [bpo-30416](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30416): The optimizer is now protected from spending much time doing
  complex calculations and consuming much memory for creating large
  constants in constant folding. Increased limits for constants that can be
  produced in constant folding.

  across platforms.
* [bpo-31506](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31506): Improve the error message logic for object.\_\_new\_\_ and
  object.\_\_init\_\_. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.
* [bpo-20361](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20361): `-b` and `-bb` now inject `'default::BytesWarning'` and
  `error::BytesWarning` entries into `sys.warnoptions`, ensuring that
  they take precedence over any other warning filters configured via the
  `-W` option or the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable.
* [bpo-32230](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32230): `-X dev` now injects a `'default'` entry into
  sys.warnoptions, ensuring that it behaves identically to actually passing
  `-Wdefault` at the command line.
* [bpo-29240](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29240): Add a new UTF-8 mode: implementation of the [**PEP 540**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0540).

  interpreter.
* [bpo-31650](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31650): Implement [**PEP 552**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0552) (Deterministic pycs). Python now supports
  invalidating bytecode cache files bashed on a source content hash rather
  than source last-modified time.
* [bpo-29469](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29469): Move constant folding from bytecode layer to AST layer.
  Original patch by Eugene Toder.

### Library[Â¶](#id183 "Permalink to this headline")

  OrderedDict and just use plain dict.
* [bpo-32279](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32279): Add params to dataclasses.make\_dataclasses(): init, repr, eq,
  order, hash, and frozen. Pass them through to dataclass().
* [bpo-32278](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32278): Make type information optional on dataclasses.make\_dataclass().
  If omitted, the string âtyping.Anyâ is used.
* [bpo-32499](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32499): Add dataclasses.is\_dataclass(obj), which returns True if obj is
  a dataclass or an instance of one.

* [bpo-32422](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32422): `functools.lru_cache` uses less memory (3 words for each
  cached key) and takes about 1/3 time for cyclic GC.
* [bpo-31721](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31721): Prevent Python crash from happening when Future.\_log\_traceback
  is set to True manually. Now it can only be set to False, or a ValueError
  is raised.

  interpreter shutdown.
* [bpo-32363](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32363): Make asyncio.Task.set\_exception() and set\_result() raise
  NotImplementedError. Task.\_step() and Future.\_\_await\_\_() raise proper
  exceptions when they are in an invalid state, instead of raising an
  AssertionError.
* [bpo-32357](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32357): Optimize asyncio.iscoroutine() and loop.create\_task() for
  non-native coroutines (e.g. async/await compiled with Cython).

  âloop.create\_task(python\_coroutine)â used to be 20% faster than
  âloop.create\_task(cython\_coroutine)â. Now, the latter is as fast.
* [bpo-32356](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32356): asyncio.transport.resume\_reading() and pause\_reading() are now
  idempotent. New transport.is\_reading() method is added.
* [bpo-32355](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32355): Optimize asyncio.gather(); now up to 15% faster.
* [bpo-32351](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32351): Use fastpath in asyncio.sleep if delay<0 (2x boost)
* [bpo-32348](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32348): Optimize asyncio.Future schedule/add/remove callback. The
  optimization shows 3-6% performance improvements of async/await code.
* [bpo-32331](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32331): Fix socket.settimeout() and socket.setblocking() to keep
  socket.type as is. Fix socket.socket() constructor to reset any bit flags
  applied to socketâs type. This change only affects OSes that have
  SOCK\_NONBLOCK and/or SOCK\_CLOEXEC.
* [bpo-32248](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32248): Add [`importlib.abc.ResourceReader`](../library/importlib.html#importlib.abc.ResourceReader "importlib.abc.ResourceReader") as an ABC for loaders
  to provide a unified API for reading resources contained within packages.
  Also add [`importlib.resources`](../library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources "importlib.resources: Package resource reading, opening, and access") as the port of
  `importlib_resources`.
* [bpo-32311](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32311): Implement asyncio.create\_task(coro) shortcut
* [bpo-32327](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32327): Convert asyncio functions that were documented as coroutines to
  coroutines. Affected functions: loop.sock\_sendall, loop.sock\_recv,
  loop.sock\_accept, loop.getaddrinfo, loop.getnameinfo.
* [bpo-32323](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32323): [`urllib.parse.urlsplit()`](../library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit "urllib.parse.urlsplit") does not convert zone-id
  (scope) to lower case for scoped IPv6 addresses in hostnames now.
* [bpo-32302](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32302): Fix bdist\_wininst of distutils for CRT v142: it binary
  compatible with CRT v140.
* [bpo-29711](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29711): Fix `stop_serving` in asyncio proactor loop kill all
  listening servers
* [bpo-32308](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32308): [`re.sub()`](../library/re.html#re.sub "re.sub") now replaces empty matches adjacent to a
  previous non-empty match.
* [bpo-29970](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29970): Abort asyncio SSLProtocol connection if handshake not complete
  within 10s
* [bpo-32314](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32314): Implement asyncio.run().
* [bpo-17852](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17852): Revert incorrect fix based on misunderstanding of
  \_Py\_PyAtExit() semantics.
* [bpo-32296](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32296): Implement asyncio.\_get\_running\_loop() and get\_event\_loop() in
  C. This makes them 4x faster.
* [bpo-32250](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32250): Implement `asyncio.current_task()` and
  `asyncio.all_tasks()`. Add helpers intended to be used by alternative
  task implementations: `asyncio._register_task`, `asyncio._enter_task`,
  `asyncio._leave_task` and `asyncio._unregister_task`. Deprecate
  `asyncio.Task.current_task()` and `asyncio.Task.all_tasks()`.
* [bpo-32255](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32255): A single empty field is now always quoted when written into a
  CSV file. This allows to distinguish an empty row from a row consisting of
  a single empty field. Patch by Licht Takeuchi.
* [bpo-32277](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32277): Raise `NotImplementedError` instead of `SystemError` on
  platforms where `chmod(..., follow_symlinks=False)` is not supported.
  Patch by Anthony Sottile.
* [bpo-30050](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30050): New argument warn\_on\_full\_buffer to signal.set\_wakeup\_fd lets
  you control whether Python prints a warning on stderr when the wakeup fd
  buffer overflows.
* [bpo-29137](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29137): The `fpectl` library has been removed. It was never enabled
  by default, never worked correctly on x86-64, and it changed the Python
  ABI in ways that caused unexpected breakage of C extensions.
* [bpo-32273](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32273): Move asyncio.test\_utils to test.test\_asyncio.
* [bpo-32272](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32272): Remove asyncio.async() function.
* [bpo-32269](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32269): Add asyncio.get\_running\_loop() function.
* [bpo-32265](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32265): All class and static methods of builtin types now are correctly
  classified by inspect.classify\_class\_attrs() and grouped in pydoc ouput.
  Added types.ClassMethodDescriptorType for unbound class methods of builtin
  types.
* [bpo-32253](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32253): Deprecate `yield from lock`, `await lock`, `with (yield
  from lock)` and `with await lock` for asyncio synchronization
  primitives.
* [bpo-22589](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22589): Changed MIME type of .bmp from âimage/x-ms-bmpâ to âimage/bmpâ
* [bpo-32193](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32193): Convert asyncio to use *async/await* syntax. Old styled `yield
  from` is still supported too.
* [bpo-32206](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32206): Add support to run modules with pdb
* [bpo-32227](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32227): `functools.singledispatch` now supports registering
  implementations using type annotations.
* [bpo-15873](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15873): Added new alternate constructors
  [`datetime.datetime.fromisoformat()`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromisoformat "datetime.datetime.fromisoformat"),
  [`datetime.time.fromisoformat()`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.time.fromisoformat "datetime.time.fromisoformat") and
  [`datetime.date.fromisoformat()`](../library/datetime.html#datetime.date.fromisoformat "datetime.date.fromisoformat") as the inverse operation of each
  classesâs respective `isoformat` methods.
* [bpo-32199](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32199): The getnode() ip getter now uses âip linkâ instead of âip link
  listâ.
* [bpo-32143](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32143): os.statvfs() includes the f\_fsid field from statvfs(2)
* [bpo-26439](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26439): Fix ctypes.util.find\_library() for AIX by implementing
  ctypes.\_aix.find\_library() Patch by: Michael Felt
* [bpo-31993](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31993): The pickler now uses less memory when serializing large bytes
  and str objects into a file. Pickles created with protocol 4 will require
  less memory for unpickling large bytes and str objects.
* [bpo-27456](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27456): Ensure TCP\_NODELAY is set on Linux. Tests by Victor Stinner.
* [bpo-31778](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31778): ast.literal\_eval() is now more strict. Addition and subtraction
  of arbitrary numbers no longer allowed.
* [bpo-31802](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31802): Importing native path module (`posixpath`, `ntpath`) now
  works even if the `os` module still is not imported.
* [bpo-30241](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30241): Add contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager. Patch by Jelle
  Zijlstra.
* [bpo-31699](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31699): Fix deadlocks in
  [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor") when task arguments or
  results cause pickling or unpickling errors. This should make sure that
  calls to the `ProcessPoolExecutor` API always eventually return.
* [bpo-15216](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15216): `TextIOWrapper.reconfigure()` supports changing *encoding*,
  *errors*, and *newline*.

### Documentation[Â¶](#id184 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32418](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32418): Add get\_loop() method to Server and AbstractServer classes.

### Tests[Â¶](#id185 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32252](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32252): Fix faulthandler\_suppress\_crash\_report() used to prevent core
  dump files when testing crashes. getrlimit() returns zero on success.
* [bpo-32002](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32002): Adjust C locale coercion testing for the empty locale and POSIX
  locale cases to more readily adjust to platform dependent behaviour.

### Windows[Â¶](#id186 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-19764](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19764): Implement support for `subprocess.Popen(close_fds=True)` on
  Windows. Patch by Segev Finer.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id187 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-24960](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24960): 2to3 and lib2to3 can now read pickled grammar files using
  pkgutil.get\_data() rather than probing the filesystem. This lets 2to3 and
  lib2to3 work when run from a zipfile.

### C API[Â¶](#id188 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32030](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32030): Py\_Initialize() doesnât reset the memory allocators to default
  if the `PYTHONMALLOC` environment variable is not set.
* [bpo-29084](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29084): Undocumented C API for OrderedDict has been excluded from the
  limited C API. It was added by mistake and actually never worked in the
  limited C API.
* [bpo-32264](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32264): Moved the pygetopt.h header into internal/, since it has no
  public APIs.
* [bpo-32241](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32241): [`Py_SetProgramName()`](../c-api/init.html#c.Py_SetProgramName "Py_SetProgramName") and [`Py_SetPythonHome()`](../c-api/init.html#c.Py_SetPythonHome "Py_SetPythonHome") now
  take the `const wchar *` arguments instead of `wchar *`.

## Python 3.7.0 alpha 3[Â¶](#python-3-7-0-alpha-3 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2017-12-05*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id189 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32176](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32176): co\_flags.CO\_NOFREE is now always set correctly by the code
  object constructor based on freevars and cellvars, rather than needing to
  be set correctly by the caller. This ensures it will be cleared
  automatically when additional cell references are injected into a modified
  code object and function.
* [bpo-10544](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10544): Yield expressions are now deprecated in comprehensions and
  generator expressions. They are still permitted in the definition of the
  outermost iterable, as that is evaluated directly in the enclosing scope.
* [bpo-32137](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32137): The repr of deeply nested dict now raises a RecursionError
  instead of crashing due to a stack overflow.
* [bpo-32096](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32096): Revert memory allocator changes in the C API: move structures
  back from \_PyRuntime to Objects/obmalloc.c. The memory allocators are once
  again initialized statically, and so PyMem\_RawMalloc() and
  Py\_DecodeLocale() can be called before \_PyRuntime\_Initialize().
* [bpo-32043](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32043): Add a new âdeveloper modeâ: new â-X devâ command line option to
  enable debug checks at runtime.
* [bpo-32023](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32023): SyntaxError is now correctly raised when a generator expression
  without parenthesis is used instead of an inheritance list in a class
  definition. The duplication of the parentheses can be omitted only on
  calls.
* [bpo-32012](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32012): SyntaxError is now correctly raised when a generator expression
  without parenthesis is passed as an argument, but followed by a trailing
  comma. A generator expression always needs to be directly inside a set of
  parentheses and cannot have a comma on either side.
* [bpo-28180](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28180): A new internal `_Py_SetLocaleFromEnv(category)` helper
  function has been added in order to improve the consistency of behaviour
  across different `libc` implementations (e.g. Android doesnât support
  setting the locale from the environment by default).
* [bpo-31949](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31949): Fixed several issues in printing tracebacks
  (PyTraceBack\_Print()).

  + Setting sys.tracebacklimit to 0 or less now suppresses printing tracebacks.
  + Setting sys.tracebacklimit to None now causes using the default limit.
  + Setting sys.tracebacklimit to an integer larger than LONG\_MAX now means using
    the limit LONG\_MAX rather than the default limit.
  + Fixed integer overflows in the case of more than 2\*\*31 traceback items on
    Windows.
  + Fixed output errors handling.
* [bpo-30696](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30696): Fix the interactive interpreter looping endlessly when no
  memory.
* [bpo-20047](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20047): Bytearray methods partition() and rpartition() now accept only
  bytes-like objects as separator, as documented. In particular they now
  raise TypeError rather of returning a bogus result when an integer is
  passed as a separator.
* [bpo-21720](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21720): BytesWarning no longer emitted when the *fromlist* argument of
  `__import__()` or the `__all__` attribute of the module contain bytes
  instances.
* [bpo-31845](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31845): Environment variables are once more read correctly at
  interpreter startup.
* [bpo-28936](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28936): Ensure that lexically first syntax error involving a parameter
  and `global` or `nonlocal` is detected first at a given scope. Patch
  by Ivan Levkivskyi.
* [bpo-31825](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31825): Fixed OverflowError in the âunicode-escapeâ codec and in
  codecs.escape\_decode() when decode an escaped non-ascii byte.
* [bpo-31618](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31618): The per-frame tracing logic added in 3.7a1 has been altered so
  that `frame->f_lineno` is updated before either `"line"` or
  `"opcode"` events are emitted. Previously, opcode events were emitted
  first, and therefore would occasionally see stale line numbers on the
  frame. The behavior of this feature has changed slightly as a result: when
  both `f_trace_lines` and `f_trace_opcodes` are enabled, line events
  now occur first.
* [bpo-28603](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28603): Print the full context/cause chain of exceptions on interpreter
  exit, even if an exception in the chain is unhashable or compares equal to
  later ones. Patch by Zane Bitter.
* [bpo-31786](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31786): Fix timeout rounding in the select module to round correctly
  negative timeouts between -1.0 and 0.0. The functions now block waiting
  for events as expected. Previously, the call was incorrectly non-blocking.
  Patch by Pablo Galindo.
* [bpo-31781](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31781): Prevent crashes when calling methods of an uninitialized
  `zipimport.zipimporter` object. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-30399](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30399): Standard repr() of BaseException with a single argument no
  longer contains redundant trailing comma.
* [bpo-31626](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31626): Fixed a bug in debug memory allocator. There was a write to
  freed memory after shrinking a memory block.
* [bpo-30817](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30817): `PyErr_PrintEx()` clears now the ignored exception that may be
  raised by `_PySys_SetObjectId()`, for example when no memory.

### Library[Â¶](#id190 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-28556](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28556): Two minor fixes for `typing` module: allow shallow copying
  instances of generic classes, improve interaction of `__init_subclass__`
  with generics. Original PRs by Ivan Levkivskyi.
* [bpo-32214](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32214): PEP 557, Data Classes. Provides a decorator which adds
  boilerplate methods to classes which use type annotations so specify
  fields.
* [bpo-27240](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27240): The header folding algorithm for the new email policies has
  been rewritten, which also fixes [bpo-30788](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30788), [bpo-31831](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31831), and [bpo-32182](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32182). In
  particular, RFC2231 folding is now done correctly.
* [bpo-32186](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32186): io.FileIO.readall() and io.FileIO.read() now release the GIL
  when getting the file size. Fixed hang of all threads with inaccessible
  NFS server. Patch by Nir Soffer.
* [bpo-32101](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32101): Add `sys.flags.dev_mode` flag
* [bpo-32154](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32154): The `asyncio.windows_utils.socketpair()` function has been
  removed: use directly [`socket.socketpair()`](../library/socket.html#socket.socketpair "socket.socketpair") which is available on all
  platforms since Python 3.5 (before, it wasnât available on Windows).
  `asyncio.windows_utils.socketpair()` was just an alias to
  `socket.socketpair` on Python 3.5 and newer.
* [bpo-32089](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32089): warnings: In development (-X dev) and debug mode (pydebug
  build), use the âdefaultâ action for ResourceWarning, rather than the
  âalwaysâ action, in the default warnings filters.
* [bpo-32107](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32107): `uuid.getnode()` now preferentially returns universally
  administered MAC addresses if available, over locally administered MAC
  addresses. This makes a better guarantee for global uniqueness of UUIDs
  returned from `uuid.uuid1()`. If only locally administered MAC
  addresses are available, the first such one found is returned.
* [bpo-23033](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23033): Wildcard is now supported in hostname when it is one and only
  character in the left most segment of hostname in second argument of
  [`ssl.match_hostname()`](../library/ssl.html#ssl.match_hostname "ssl.match_hostname"). Patch by Mandeep Singh.
* [bpo-12239](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12239): Make [`msilib.SummaryInformation.GetProperty()`](../library/msilib.html#msilib.SummaryInformation.GetProperty "msilib.SummaryInformation.GetProperty") return
  `None` when the value of property is `VT_EMPTY`. Initial patch by
  Mark Mc Mahon.
* [bpo-28334](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28334): Use [`os.path.expanduser()`](../library/os.path.html#os.path.expanduser "os.path.expanduser") to find the `~/.netrc` file in
  [`netrc.netrc`](../library/netrc.html#netrc.netrc "netrc.netrc"). If it does not exist, [`FileNotFoundError`](../library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError "FileNotFoundError") is
  raised. Patch by Dimitri Merejkowsky.
* [bpo-32121](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32121): Made `tracemalloc.Traceback` behave more like the traceback
  module, sorting the frames from oldest to most recent.
  `Traceback.format()` now accepts negative *limit*, truncating the result
  to the `abs(limit)` oldest frames. To get the old behaviour, one can use
  the new *most\_recent\_first* argument to `Traceback.format()`. (Patch by
  Jesse Bakker.)
* [bpo-31325](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31325): Fix wrong usage of [`collections.namedtuple()`](../library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple "collections.namedtuple") in the
  [`RobotFileParser.parse()`](../library/urllib.robotparser.html#urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser.parse "urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser.parse")
  method.

  Initial patch by Robin Wellner.
* [bpo-12382](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12382): [`msilib.OpenDatabase()`](../library/msilib.html#msilib.OpenDatabase "msilib.OpenDatabase") now raises a better exception
  message when it couldnât open or create an MSI file. Initial patch by
  William TisÃ¤ter.
* [bpo-19610](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19610): `setup()` now warns about invalid types for some fields.

  The `distutils.dist.Distribution` class now warns when `classifiers`,
  `keywords` and `platforms` fields are not specified as a list or a
  string.
* [bpo-32071](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32071): Added the `-k` command-line option to `python -m unittest`
  to run only tests that match the given pattern(s).
* [bpo-10049](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10049): Added *nullcontext* no-op context manager to contextlib. This
  provides a simpler and faster alternative to ExitStack() when handling
  optional context managers.
* [bpo-28684](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28684): The new test.support.skip\_unless\_bind\_unix\_socket() decorator
  is used here to skip asyncio tests that fail because the platform lacks a
  functional bind() function for unix domain sockets (as it is the case for
  non root users on the recent Android versions that run now SELinux in
  enforcing mode).
* [bpo-32110](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32110): `codecs.StreamReader.read(n)` now returns not more than *n*
  characters/bytes for non-negative *n*. This makes it compatible with
  `read()` methods of other file-like objects.
* [bpo-27535](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27535): The warnings module doesnât leak memory anymore in the hidden
  warnings registry for the âignoreâ action of warnings filters.
  warn\_explicit() function doesnât add the warning key to the registry
  anymore for the âignoreâ action.
* [bpo-32088](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32088): warnings: When Python is build is debug mode (`Py_DEBUG`),
  [`DeprecationWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning "DeprecationWarning"), [`PendingDeprecationWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#PendingDeprecationWarning "PendingDeprecationWarning") and
  [`ImportWarning`](../library/exceptions.html#ImportWarning "ImportWarning") warnings are now displayed by default.
* [bpo-1647489](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1647489): Fixed searching regular expression patterns that could match
  an empty string. Non-empty string can now be correctly found after
  matching an empty string.

* [bpo-31985](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31985): Formally deprecated aifc.openfp, sunau.openfp, and wave.openfp.
  Since change 7bc817d5ba917528e8bd07ec461c635291e7b06a in 1993, openfp in
  each of the three modules had been pointing to that moduleâs open function
  as a matter of backwards compatibility, though it had been both untested
  and undocumented.

  objects to display in an error message, to protect against badly behaved
  custom reprs.
* [bpo-30768](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30768): Fix the pthread+semaphore implementation of
  PyThread\_acquire\_lock\_timed() when called with timeout > 0 and
  intr\_flag=0: recompute the timeout if sem\_timedwait() is interrupted by a
  signal (EINTR). See also the [**PEP 475**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475).

  exception when a date falls outside of the 0001-01-01 through 9999-12-31
  range. To support applications that cannot tolerate such exceptions, the
  new methods itermonthdays3() and itermonthdays4() are added. The new
  methods return tuples and are not restricted by the range supported by
  datetime.date.
* [bpo-28564](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28564): The shutil.rmtree() function has been sped up to 20â40%. This

  into the kernel 4.5.
* [bpo-32138](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32138): Skip on Android test\_faulthandler tests that raise SIGSEGV and
  remove the test.support.requires\_android\_level decorator.
* [bpo-32136](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32136): The runtime embedding tests have been split out from
  `Lib/test/test_capi.py` into a new `Lib/test/test_embed.py` file.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id196 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32207](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32207): Improve tk event exception tracebacks in IDLE. When tk event
  handling is driven by IDLEâs run loop, a confusing and distracting
  queue.EMPTY traceback context is no longer added to tk event exception
  tracebacks. The traceback is now the same as when event handling is
  driven by user code. Patch based on a suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.
* [bpo-32164](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32164): Delete unused file idlelib/tabbedpages.py. Use of TabbedPageSet
  in configdialog was replaced by ttk.Notebook.
* [bpo-32100](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32100): IDLE: Fix old and new bugs in pathbrowser; improve tests. Patch
  mostly by Cheryl Sabella.
* [bpo-31858](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31858): IDLE â Restrict shell prompt manipulation to the shell. Editor
  and output windows only see an empty last prompt line. This simplifies
  the code and fixes a minor bug when newline is inserted. Sys.ps1, if
  present, is read on Shell start-up, but is not set or changed.
* [bpo-31860](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31860): The font sample in the IDLE configuration dialog is now
  editable. Changes persist while IDLE remains open
* [bpo-31836](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31836): Test\_code\_module now passes if run after test\_idle, which sets
  ps1.

  The code module uses sys.ps1 if present or sets it to â>>> â if not.
  Test\_code\_module now properly tests both behaviors. Ditto for ps2.
* [bpo-28603](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28603): Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing a
  traceback that includes an exception that is unhashable. Patch by Zane
  Bitter.
* [bpo-13802](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13802): Use non-Latin characters in the IDLEâs Font settings sample.
  Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode
  Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a
  character. The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters a
  better idea of what they might see in IDLEâs shell and editors.

  To make room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are
  re-arranged. The Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id197 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32159](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32159): Remove CVS and Subversion tools: remove svneol.py and
  treesync.py scripts. CPython migrated from CVS to Subversion, to
  Mercurial, and then to Git. CVS and Subversion are no longer used to
  develop CPython.

### C API[Â¶](#id198 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-20891](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20891): Fix PyGILState\_Ensure(). When PyGILState\_Ensure() is called in
  a non-Python thread before PyEval\_InitThreads(), only call
  PyEval\_InitThreads() after calling PyThreadState\_New() to fix a crash.
* [bpo-32125](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32125): The `Py_UseClassExceptionsFlag` flag has been removed. It was
  deprecated and wasnât used anymore since Python 2.0.
* [bpo-25612](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25612): Move the current exception state from the frame object to the
  co-routine. This simplifies the interpreter and fixes a couple of obscure
  bugs caused by having swap exception state when entering or exiting a
  generator.
* [bpo-23699](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23699): Add Py\_RETURN\_RICHCOMPARE macro to reduce boilerplate code in
  rich comparison functions.
* [bpo-30697](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30697): The `PyExc_RecursionErrorInst` singleton is removed and
  `PyErr_NormalizeException()` does not use it anymore. This singleton is
  persistent and its members being never cleared may cause a segfault during
  finalization of the interpreter. See also [bpo-22898](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22898).

## Python 3.7.0 alpha 2[Â¶](#python-3-7-0-alpha-2 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2017-10-16*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id199 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31558](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31558): `gc.freeze()` is a new API that allows for moving all objects
  currently tracked by the garbage collector to a permanent generation,
  effectively removing them from future collection events. This can be used
  to protect those objects from having their PyGC\_Head mutated. In effect,
  this enables great copy-on-write stability at fork().
* [bpo-31642](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31642): Restored blocking âfrom package import moduleâ by setting
  sys.modules[âpackage.moduleâ] to None.

  underscores to integer with binary base.
* [bpo-31602](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31602): Fix an assertion failure in `zipimporter.get_source()` in case
  of a bad [`zlib.decompress()`](../library/zlib.html#zlib.decompress "zlib.decompress"). Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31592](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31592): Fixed an assertion failure in Python parser in case of a bad
  [`unicodedata.normalize()`](../library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize "unicodedata.normalize"). Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31588](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31588): Raise a [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError") with a helpful error message when class
  creation fails due to a metaclass with a bad `__prepare__()` method.
  Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31574](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31574): Importlib was instrumented with two dtrace probes to profile
  import timing.
* [bpo-31566](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31566): Fix an assertion failure in `_warnings.warn()` in case of a bad
  `__name__` global. Patch by Oren Milman.

  object.\_\_init\_\_.
* [bpo-31505](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31505): Fix an assertion failure in [`json`](../library/json.html#module-json "json: Encode and decode the JSON format."), in case
  `_json.make_encoder()` received a bad `encoder()` argument. Patch by Oren
  Milman.
* [bpo-31492](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31492): Fix assertion failures in case of failing to import from a
  module with a bad `__name__` attribute, and in case of failing to access
  an attribute of such a module. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31478](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31478): Fix an assertion failure in `_random.Random.seed()` in case the
  argument has a bad `__abs__()` method. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31336](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31336): Speed up class creation by 10-20% by reducing the overhead in
  the necessary special method lookups. Patch by Stefan Behnel.
* [bpo-31415](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31415): Add `-X importtime` option to show how long each import
  takes. It can be used to optimize applicationâs startup time. Support the
  [`PYTHONPROFILEIMPORTTIME`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPROFILEIMPORTTIME) as an equivalent way to enable this.
* [bpo-31410](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31410): Optimized calling wrapper and classmethod descriptors.
* [bpo-31353](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31353): [**PEP 553**](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553) - Add a new built-in called `breakpoint()` which
  calls `sys.breakpointhook()`. By default this imports `pdb` and calls
  `pdb.set_trace()`, but users may override `sys.breakpointhook()` to
  call whatever debugger they want. The original value of the hook is saved
  in `sys.__breakpointhook__`.
* [bpo-17852](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17852): Maintain a list of open buffered files, flush them before
  exiting the interpreter. Based on a patch from Armin Rigo.
* [bpo-31315](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31315): Fix an assertion failure in imp.create\_dynamic(), when
  spec.name is not a string. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31311](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31311): Fix a crash in the `__setstate__()` method of
  [`ctypes._CData`](../library/ctypes.html#ctypes._CData "ctypes._CData"), in case of a bad `__dict__`. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31293](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31293): Fix crashes in true division and multiplication of a timedelta
  object by a float with a bad as\_integer\_ratio() method. Patch by Oren
  Milman.
* [bpo-31285](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31285): Fix an assertion failure in [`warnings.warn_explicit`](../library/warnings.html#warnings.warn_explicit "warnings.warn_explicit"), when the
  return value of the received loaderâs get\_source() has a bad splitlines()
  method. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-30406](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30406): Make `async` and `await` proper keywords, as specified in
  PEP 492.

### Library[Â¶](#id200 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30058](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30058): Fixed buffer overflow in select.kqueue.control().
* [bpo-31672](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31672): `idpattern` in `string.Template` matched some non-ASCII
  characters. Now it uses `-i` regular expression local flag to avoid
  non-ASCII characters.
* [bpo-31701](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31701): On Windows, faulthandler.enable() now ignores MSC and COM
  exceptions.
* [bpo-31728](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31728): Prevent crashes in `_elementtree` due to unsafe cleanup of
  `Element.text` and `Element.tail`. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31671](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31671): Now `re.compile()` converts passed RegexFlag to normal int
  object before compiling. bm\_regex\_compile benchmark shows 14% performance
  improvements.
* [bpo-30397](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30397): The types of compiled regular objects and match objects are now
  exposed as `re.Pattern` and `re.Match`. This adds information in pydoc
  output for the re module.
* [bpo-31675](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31675): Fixed memory leaks in Tkinterâs methods splitlist() and split()
  when pass a string larger than 2 GiB.
* [bpo-31673](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31673): Fixed typo in the name of Tkinterâs method adderrorinfo().
* [bpo-31648](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31648): Improvements to path predicates in ElementTree:

  + Allow whitespace around predicate parts, i.e. â[a = âtextâ]â instead of requiring the less readable â[a=âtextâ]â.
  + Add support for text comparison of the current node, like â[.=âtextâ]â.

  Patch by Stefan Behnel.
* [bpo-30806](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30806): Fix the string representation of a netrc object.
* [bpo-31638](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31638): Add optional argument `compressed` to
  `zipapp.create_archive`, and add option `--compress` to the command
  line interface of `zipapp`.
* [bpo-25351](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25351): Avoid venv activate failures with undefined variables
* [bpo-20519](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20519): Avoid ctypes use (if possible) and improve import time for
  uuid.
* [bpo-28293](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28293): The regular expression cache is no longer completely dumped
  when it is full.
* [bpo-31596](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31596): Added pthread\_getcpuclockid() to the time module
* [bpo-27494](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27494): Make 2to3 accept a trailing comma in generator expressions. For
  example, `set(x for x in [],)` is now allowed.
* [bpo-30347](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30347): Stop crashes when concurrently iterate over itertools.groupby()
  iterators.
* [bpo-30346](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30346): An iterator produced by itertools.groupby() iterator now
  becomes exhausted after advancing the groupby iterator.
* [bpo-31556](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31556): Cancel asyncio.wait\_for future faster if timeout <= 0
* [bpo-31540](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31540): Allow passing a context object in
  [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor") constructor. Also, free
  job resources in [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](../library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor "concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor") earlier
  to improve memory usage when a worker waits for new jobs.
* [bpo-31516](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31516): `threading.current_thread()` should not return a dummy thread
  at shutdown.
* [bpo-31525](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31525): In the sqlite module, require the sqlite3\_prepare\_v2 API. Thus,
  the sqlite module now requires sqlite version at least 3.3.9.
* [bpo-26510](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26510): argparse subparsers are now required by default. This matches
  behaviour in Python 2. For optional subparsers, use the new parameter
  `add_subparsers(required=False)`. Patch by Anthony Sottile. (As of
  3.7.0rc1, the default was changed to not required as had been the case
  since Python 3.3.)
* [bpo-27541](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27541): Reprs of subclasses of some collection and iterator classes
  ([`bytearray`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray"), [`array.array`](../library/array.html#array.array "array.array"), [`collections.deque`](../library/collections.html#collections.deque "collections.deque"),
  [`collections.defaultdict`](../library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict "collections.defaultdict"), [`itertools.count`](../library/itertools.html#itertools.count "itertools.count"), [`itertools.repeat`](../library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat "itertools.repeat")) now
  contain actual type name insteads of hardcoded name of the base class.
* [bpo-31351](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31351): python -m ensurepip now exits with non-zero exit code if pip
  bootstrapping has failed.
* [bpo-31389](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31389): `pdb.set_trace()` now takes an optional keyword-only argument
  `header`. If given, this is printed to the console just before debugging
  begins.

### Documentation[Â¶](#id201 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31537](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31537): Fix incorrect usage of `get_history_length` in readline
  documentation example code. Patch by Brad Smith.
* [bpo-30085](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30085): The operator functions without double underscores are preferred
  for clarity. The one with underscores are only kept for
  back-compatibility.

### Build[Â¶](#id202 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31696](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31696): Improve compiler version information in [`sys.version`](../library/sys.html#sys.version "sys.version")
  when Python is built with Clang.
* [bpo-31625](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31625): Stop using ranlib on static libraries. Instead, we assume ar
  supports the âsâ flag.
* [bpo-31624](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31624): Remove support for BSD/OS.
* [bpo-22140](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22140): Prevent double substitution of prefix in python-config.sh.
* [bpo-31569](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31569): Correct PCBuild/ case to PCbuild/ in build scripts and
  documentation.
* [bpo-31536](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31536): Avoid wholesale rebuild after `make regen-all` if nothing
  changed.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id203 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31460](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31460): Simplify the API of IDLEâs Module Browser.

  Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the option
  of creating a browser frame that is only part of a window. Passing a full
  file name instead of pieces assumed to come from a .py file opens the
  possibility of browsing python files that do not end in .py.
* [bpo-31649](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31649): IDLE - Make \_htest, \_utest parameters keyword only.
* [bpo-31559](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31559): Remove test order dependence in idle\_test.test\_browser.
* [bpo-31459](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31459): Rename IDLEâs module browser from Class Browser to Module
  Browser. The original module-level class and method browser became a
  module browser, with the addition of module-level functions, years ago.
  Nested classes and functions were added yesterday. For
  back-compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which
  appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, is not changed. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.
* [bpo-31500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31500): Default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.
* [bpo-1612262](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1612262): IDLE module browser now shows nested classes and functions.
  Original patches for code and tests by Guilherme Polo and Cheryl Sabella,
  respectively.

### C API[Â¶](#id204 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-28280](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28280): Make `PyMapping_Keys()`, `PyMapping_Values()` and
  `PyMapping_Items()` always return a [`list`](../library/stdtypes.html#list "list") (rather than a [`list`](../library/stdtypes.html#list "list") or a
  [`tuple`](../library/stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple")). Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31532](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31532): Fix memory corruption due to allocator mix in getpath.c between
  Py\_GetPath() and Py\_SetPath()
* [bpo-25658](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25658): Implement PEP 539 for Thread Specific Storage (TSS) API: it is
  a new Thread Local Storage (TLS) API to CPython which would supersede use
  of the existing TLS API within the CPython interpreter, while deprecating
  the existing API. PEP written by Erik M. Bray, patch by Masayuki Yamamoto.

## Python 3.7.0 alpha 1[Â¶](#python-3-7-0-alpha-1 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2017-09-19*

### Security[Â¶](#id205 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29781](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29781): SSLObject.version() now correctly returns None when handshake
  over BIO has not been performed yet.
* [bpo-29505](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29505): Add fuzz tests for float(str), int(str), unicode(str); for
  oss-fuzz.
* [bpo-30947](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30947): Upgrade libexpat embedded copy from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 to
  get security fixes.
* [bpo-30730](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30730): Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on
  Windows. Prevent passing other environment variables and command
  arguments.
* [bpo-30694](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30694): Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple
  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0âs fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesnât
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using `XML_SetHashSalt()`.
* [bpo-30500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30500): Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, `splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')` now correctly returns the
  `127.0.0.1` host, instead of treating `@evil.com` as the host in an
  authentication (`login@host`).
* [bpo-29591](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29591): Update expat copy from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 to get fixes of
  CVE-2016-0718 and CVE-2016-4472. See
  <https://sourceforge.net/p/expat/bugs/537/> for more information.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id206 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31490](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31490): Fix an assertion failure in [`ctypes`](../library/ctypes.html#module-ctypes "ctypes: A foreign function library for Python.") class definition, in case
  the class has an attribute whose name is specified in `_anonymous_` but
  not in `_fields_`. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31471](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31471): Fix an assertion failure in [`subprocess.Popen()`](../library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen "subprocess.Popen") on Windows, in
  case the env argument has a bad keys() method. Patch by Oren Milman.

  warnings.defaultaction. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-28411](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28411): Change direct usage of PyInterpreterState.modules to
  PyImport\_GetModuleDict(). Also introduce more uniformity in other code
  that deals with sys.modules. This helps reduce complications when working
  on sys.modules.
* [bpo-28411](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28411): Switch to the abstract API when dealing with
  `PyInterpreterState.modules`. This allows later support for all dict
  subclasses and other Mapping implementations. Also add a
  `PyImport_GetModule()` function to reduce a bunch of duplicated code.
* [bpo-31411](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31411): Raise a TypeError instead of SystemError in case
  warnings.onceregistry is not a dictionary. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31344](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31344): For finer control of tracing behaviour when testing the
  interpreter, two new frame attributes have been added to control the
  emission of particular trace events: `f_trace_lines` (`True` by
  default) to turn off per-line trace events; and `f_trace_opcodes`
  (`False` by default) to turn on per-opcode trace events.
* [bpo-31373](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31373): Fix several possible instances of undefined behavior due to
  floating-point demotions.
* [bpo-30465](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30465): Location information (`lineno` and `col_offset`) in
  f-strings is now (mostly) correct. This fixes tools like flake8 from
  showing warnings on the wrong line (typically the first line of the file).
* [bpo-30860](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30860): Consolidate CPythonâs global runtime state under a single
  struct. This improves discoverability of the runtime state.

* [bpo-31343](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31343): Include sys/sysmacros.h for major(), minor(), and makedev().
  GNU C libray plans to remove the functions from sys/types.h.
* [bpo-31291](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31291): Fix an assertion failure in [`zipimport.zipimporter.get_data`](../library/zipimport.html#zipimport.zipimporter.get_data "zipimport.zipimporter.get_data") on
  Windows, when the return value of `pathname.replace('/','\\')` isnât a
  string. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31271](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31271): Fix an assertion failure in the write() method of
  [`io.TextIOWrapper`](../library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper "io.TextIOWrapper"), when the encoder doesnât return a bytes object. Patch
  by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31243](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31243): Fix a crash in some methods of [`io.TextIOWrapper`](../library/io.html#io.TextIOWrapper "io.TextIOWrapper"), when the
  decoderâs state is invalid. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-30721](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30721): `print` now shows correct usage hint for using Python 2
  redirection syntax. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.
* [bpo-31070](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31070): Fix a race condition in importlib \_get\_module\_lock().

  Avoid using Py\_AddPendingCall from signal handler, to avoid calling
  signal-unsafe functions. The tests Iâm adding here fail without the rest
  of the patch, on Linux and OS X. This means our signal delivery logic had
  defects (some signals could be lost).
* [bpo-30765](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30765): Avoid blocking in pthread\_mutex\_lock() when

* [bpo-30501](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30501): The compiler now produces more optimal code for complex
  condition expressions in the âifâ, âwhileâ and âassertâ statement, the
  âifâ expression, and generator expressions and comprehensions.
* [bpo-28180](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28180): Implement PEP 538 (legacy C locale coercion). This means that
  when a suitable coercion target locale is available, both the core
  interpreter and locale-aware C extensions will assume the use of UTF-8 as
  the default text encoding, rather than ASCII.

* [bpo-25324](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25324): Tokens needed for parsing in Python moved to C. `COMMENT`,
  `NL` and `ENCODING`. This way the tokens and tok\_names in the token
  module donât get changed when you import the tokenize module.
* [bpo-29104](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29104): Fixed parsing backslashes in f-strings.
* [bpo-27945](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27945): Fixed various segfaults with dict when input collections are

  rather than `format(str(self), '')`.
* [bpo-30024](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30024): Circular imports involving absolute imports with binding a
  submodule to a name are now supported.
* [bpo-12414](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12414): sys.getsizeof() on a code object now returns the sizes which
  includes the code struct and sizes of objects which it references. Patch
  by Dong-hee Na.
* [bpo-29839](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29839): len() now raises ValueError rather than OverflowError if
  \_\_len\_\_() returned a large negative integer.
* [bpo-11913](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=11913): README.rst is now included in the list of distutils standard

* [bpo-29816](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29816): Shift operation now has less opportunity to raise
  OverflowError. ValueError always is raised rather than OverflowError for
  negative counts. Shifting zero with non-negative count always returns
  zero.
* [bpo-24821](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24821): Fixed the slowing down to 25 times in the searching of some
  unlucky Unicode characters.

  identify each subinterpreter.
* [bpo-29894](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29894): The deprecation warning is emitted if \_\_complex\_\_ returns an
  instance of a strict subclass of complex. In a future versions of Python
  this can be an error.

  objects follow the buffer protocol.
* [bpo-29723](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29723): The `sys.path[0]` initialization change for [bpo-29139](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29139) caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing `__main__` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import
  locationâs parent directory to `sys.path`, and ensures no other
  `sys.path` entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import
  location named on the command line.
* [bpo-29568](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29568): Escaped percent â%%â in the format string for classic string

  anymore. It affects `co_firstlineno` and `co_lnotab` of code object
  for module and class. (Reverted in [bpo-32911](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32911).)

  with os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() which are already using UTF-8.
* [bpo-28991](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28991): functools.lru\_cache() was susceptible to an obscure reentrancy
  bug triggerable by a monkey-patched len() function.

  `__classcell__` namespace entry up to `type.__new__` now results in a
  `DeprecationWarning` and a class that supports zero-argument
  `super()`.
* [bpo-28797](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28797): Modifying the class \_\_dict\_\_ inside the \_\_set\_name\_\_ method of

  threads to wait until all these threads complete in server\_close().
* [bpo-28638](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28638): Changed the implementation strategy for
  collections.namedtuple() to substantially reduce the use of exec() in
  favor of precomputed methods. As a result, the *verbose* parameter and
  *\_source* attribute are no longer supported. The benefits include 1)
  having a smaller memory footprint for applications using multiple named
  tuples, 2) faster creation of the named tuple class (approx 4x to 6x
  depending on how it is measured), and 3) minor speed-ups for instance
  creation using \_\_new\_\_, \_make, and \_replace. (The primary patch
  contributor is Jelle Zijlstra with further improvements by INADA Naoki,
  Serhiy Storchaka, and Raymond Hettinger.)

  `braceidpattern` if they want to specify different placeholder patterns
  inside and outside the braces. If None (the default) it falls back to
  `idpattern`.
* [bpo-31326](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31326): concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.shutdown() now
  explicitly closes the call queue. Moreover, shutdown(wait=True) now also
  join the call queue thread, to prevent leaking a dangling thread.
* [bpo-27144](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27144): The `map()` and `as_completed()` iterators in

  some error types have been changed to more specific ones.
* [bpo-31109](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31109): Convert zipimport to use Argument Clinic.
* [bpo-30102](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30102): The ssl and hashlib modules now call
  OPENSSL\_add\_all\_algorithms\_noconf() on OpenSSL < 1.1.0. The function
  detects CPU features and enables optimizations on some CPU architectures
  such as POWER8. Patch is based on research from Gustavo Serra Scalet.
* [bpo-18966](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18966): Non-daemonic threads created by a multiprocessing.Process are
  now joined on child exit.
* [bpo-31183](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31183): [`dis`](../library/dis.html#module-dis "dis: Disassembler for Python bytecode.") now works with asynchronous generator and coroutine
  objects. Patch by George Collins based on diagnosis by Luciano Ramalho.
* [bpo-5001](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=5001): There are a number of uninformative asserts in the
  [`multiprocessing`](../library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing "multiprocessing: Process-based parallelism.") module, as noted in issue 5001. This change fixes two of
  the most potentially problematic ones, since they are in error-reporting
  code, in the `multiprocessing.managers.convert_to_error` function. (It
  also makes more informative a ValueError message.) The only potentially
  problematic change is that the AssertionError is now a TypeError; however,
  this should also help distinguish it from an AssertionError being
  *reported* by the function/its caller (such as in issue 31169). - Patch by
  Allen W. Smith (drallensmith on github).
* [bpo-31185](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31185): Fixed miscellaneous errors in asyncio speedup module.

* [bpo-31135](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31135): ttk: fix the destroy() method of LabeledScale and OptionMenu
  classes. Call the parent destroy() method even if the used attribute
  doesnât exist. The LabeledScale.destroy() method now also explicitly
  clears label and scale attributes to help the garbage collector to destroy
  all widgets.

  value.

  Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(),
  which is specified as taking microsecond-resolution intervals. However, on
  some platform, our conversion routine could convert 1e-6 into a zero
  interval, therefore disabling the timer instead of (re-)scheduling it.

  multiprocessing.Condition.notify().

  The doc claims multiprocessing.Condition behaves like threading.Condition,
  but its notify() method lacked the optional ânâ argument (to specify the
  number of sleepers to wake up) that threading.Condition.notify() accepts.

  have a non repr() based thread name by default when no thread\_name\_prefix
  is supplied. They will now identify themselves as
  âThreadPoolExecutor-y\_nâ.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id212 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-31493](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31493): IDLE code context â fix code update and font update timers.

  Canceling timers prevents a warning message when test\_idle completes.
* [bpo-31488](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31488): IDLE - Update non-key options in former extension classes. When
  applying configdialog changes, call .reload for each feature class. Change
  ParenMatch so updated options affect existing instances attached to
  existing editor windows.
* [bpo-31477](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31477): IDLE - Improve rstrip entry in doc. Strip trailing whitespace
  strips more than blank spaces. Multiline string literals are not skipped.

  update in the background in order to make live

  interaction and experimentation with tkinter applications much easier.
* [bpo-31414](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31414): IDLE â fix tk entry box tests by deleting first. Adding to an
  int entry is not the same as deleting and inserting because int(ââ) will
  fail.
* [bpo-31051](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31051): Rearrange IDLE configdialog GenPage into Window, Editor, and
  Help sections.

  Move some data and functions from the class to module level. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.
* [bpo-31287](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31287): IDLE - Do not modify tkinter.message in test\_configdialog.
* [bpo-27099](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27099): Convert IDLEâs built-in âextensionsâ to regular features.

  About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions.
  Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not
  good for maintenance. Hence the conversion.

  The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings for
  builtin features are now handled uniformly. Now, editing a binding in a
  keyset only affects its value in the keyset. All bindings are defined
  together in the system-specific default keysets in config-extensions.def.
  All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-extension.cfg. All take
  effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok.

  The affected events are â<<force-open-completions>>â, â<<expand-word>>â,
  â<<force-open-calltip>>â, â<<flash-paren>>â, â<<format-paragraph>>â,
  â<<run-module>>â, â<<check-module>>â, and â<<zoom-height>>â. Any (global)
  customizations made before 3.6.3 will not affect their keyset-specific
  customization after 3.6.3. and vice versa.

  Initial patch by Charles Wohlganger.

* [bpo-19903](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19903): IDLE: Calltips use [`inspect.signature`](../library/inspect.html#inspect.signature "inspect.signature") instead of
  [`inspect.getfullargspec`](../library/inspect.html#inspect.getfullargspec "inspect.getfullargspec"). This improves calltips for builtins converted to
  use Argument Clinic. Patch by Louie Lu.

* [bpo-30853](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30853): IDLE â Factor a VarTrace class out of ConfigDialog.

  Instance tracers manages pairs consisting of a tk variable and a callback
  function. When tracing is turned on, setting the variable calls the
  function. Test coverage for the new class is 100%.
* [bpo-31003](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31003): IDLE: Add more tests for General tab.

  create widgets function.

  In test\_configdialog: Fix test\_font\_set so not order dependent. Fix
  renamed test\_indent\_scale so it tests the widget. Adjust tests for
  movement of set\_samples call. Add tests for load functions. Put all font
  tests in one class and tab indent tests in another. Except for two lines,
  these tests completely cover the related functions.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id213 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30983](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30983): gdb integration commands (py-bt, etc.) work on optimized shared
  builds now, too. PEP 523 introduced \_PyEval\_EvalFrameDefault which
  inlines PyEval\_EvalFrameEx on non-debug shared builds. This broke the
  ability to use py-bt, py-up, and a few other Python-specific gdb
  integrations. The problem is fixed by only looking for
  \_PyEval\_EvalFrameDefault frames in python-gdb.py. Original patch by Bruno
  âPolacoâ Penteado.
* [bpo-29748](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29748): Added the slice index converter in Argument Clinic.
* [bpo-24037](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24037): Argument Clinic now uses the converter `bool(accept={int})`
  rather than [`int`](../library/functions.html#int "int") for semantical booleans. This avoids repeating the
  default value for Python and C and will help in converting to [`bool`](../library/functions.html#bool "bool") in
  future.
* [bpo-29367](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29367): python-gdb.py now supports also `method-wrapper`

  PROTOCOL\_TLSv1\_2 to make them pass on Debian.

### Build[Â¶](#id232 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32635](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32635): Fix segfault of the crypt module when libxcrypt is provided
  instead of libcrypt at the system.

### Windows[Â¶](#id233 "Permalink to this headline")

  launching Python.
* [bpo-32370](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32370): Use the correct encoding for ipconfig output in the uuid
  module. Patch by Segev Finer.
* [bpo-29248](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29248): Fix [`os.readlink()`](../library/os.html#os.readlink "os.readlink") on Windows, which was mistakenly
  treating the `PrintNameOffset` field of the reparse data buffer as a
  number of characters instead of bytes. Patch by Craig Holmquist and SSE4.
* [bpo-32588](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32588): Create standalone \_distutils\_findvs module.

  supports macOS 10.9+ systems in 64-bit mode only. Upgrade the supplied
  third-party libraries to OpenSSL 1.0.2n, XZ 5.2.3, and SQLite 3.22.0. The
  10.9+ installer now links with and supplies its own copy of Tcl/Tk 8.6.8.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id235 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32984](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32984): Set `__file__` while running a startup file. Like Python,
  IDLE optionally runs one startup file in the Shell window before
  presenting the first interactive input prompt. For IDLE, `-s` runs a
  file named in environmental variable `IDLESTARTUP` or
  [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP); `-r file` runs `file`. Python sets
  `__file__` to the startup file name before running the file and unsets
  it before the first prompt. IDLE now does the same when run normally,
  without the `-n` option.
* [bpo-32940](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32940): Simplify and rename StringTranslatePseudoMapping in pyparse.

* [bpo-32837](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32837): Using the system and place-dependent default encoding for
  open() is a bad idea for IDLEâs system and location-independent files.
* [bpo-32826](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32826): Add âencoding=utf-8â to open() in IDLEâs test\_help\_about. GUI
  test test\_file\_buttons() only looks at initial ascii-only lines, but
  failed on systems where open() defaults to âasciiâ because readline()
  internally reads and decodes far enough ahead to encounter a non-ascii
  character in CREDITS.txt.
* [bpo-32765](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32765): Update configdialog General tab docstring to add new widgets to
  the widget list.

  pkgutil.get\_data() rather than probing the filesystem. This lets 2to3 and
  lib2to3 work when run from a zipfile.
* [bpo-32222](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32222): Fix pygettext not extracting docstrings for functions with type
  annotated arguments. Patch by Toby Harradine.

### C API[Â¶](#id237 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29084](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29084): Undocumented C API for OrderedDict has been excluded from the
  limited C API. It was added by mistake and actually never worked in the
  limited C API.

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id238 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32176](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32176): co\_flags.CO\_NOFREE is now always set correctly by the code
  object constructor based on freevars and cellvars, rather than needing to
  be set correctly by the caller. This ensures it will be cleared
  automatically when additional cell references are injected into a modified
  code object and function.
* [bpo-31949](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31949): Fixed several issues in printing tracebacks
  (PyTraceBack\_Print()).

  bytes-like objects as separator, as documented. In particular they now
  raise TypeError rather of returning a bogus result when an integer is
  passed as a separator.

  negative timeouts between -1.0 and 0.0. The functions now block waiting
  for events as expected. Previously, the call was incorrectly non-blocking.
  Patch by Pablo Galindo.
* [bpo-31642](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31642): Restored blocking âfrom package import moduleâ by setting

  the class has an attribute whose name is specified in `_anonymous_` but
  not in `_fields_`. Patch by Oren Milman.
* [bpo-31478](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31478): Fix an assertion failure in `_random.Random.seed()` in case the
  argument has a bad `__abs__()` method. Patch by Oren Milman.

### IDLE[Â¶](#id245 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32207](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32207): Improve tk event exception tracebacks in IDLE. When tk event
  handling is driven by IDLEâs run loop, a confusing and distracting
  queue.EMPTY traceback context is no longer added to tk event exception
  tracebacks. The traceback is now the same as when event handling is
  driven by user code. Patch based on a suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.
* [bpo-32164](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32164): Delete unused file idlelib/tabbedpages.py. Use of TabbedPageSet

  mostly by Cheryl Sabella.
* [bpo-31858](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31858): IDLE â Restrict shell prompt manipulation to the shell. Editor
  and output windows only see an empty last prompt line. This simplifies
  the code and fixes a minor bug when newline is inserted. Sys.ps1, if
  present, is read on Shell start-up, but is not set or changed.
* [bpo-31860](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31860): The font sample in the IDLE configuration dialog is now
  editable. Changes persist while IDLE remains open
* [bpo-31836](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31836): Test\_code\_module now passes if run after test\_idle, which sets
  ps1.

  The code module uses sys.ps1 if present or sets it to â>>> â if not.
  Test\_code\_module now properly tests both behaviors. Ditto for ps2.
* [bpo-28603](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28603): Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing a
  traceback that includes an exception that is unhashable. Patch by Zane
  Bitter.
* [bpo-13802](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=13802): Use non-Latin characters in the IDLEâs Font settings sample.
  Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode
  Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a
  character. The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters a
  better idea of what they might see in IDLEâs shell and editors. To make
  room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are re-arranged. The
  Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.
* [bpo-31460](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31460): Simplify the API of IDLEâs Module Browser.

  Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the option
  of creating a browser frame that is only part of a window. Passing a full
  file name instead of pieces assumed to come from a .py file opens the
  possibility of browsing python files that do not end in .py.
* [bpo-31649](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31649): IDLE - Make \_htest, \_utest parameters keyword only.
* [bpo-31559](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31559): Remove test order dependence in idle\_test.test\_browser.
* [bpo-31459](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31459): Rename IDLEâs module browser from Class Browser to Module
  Browser. The original module-level class and method browser became a
  module browser, with the addition of module-level functions, years ago.
  Nested classes and functions were added yesterday. For
  back-compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which
  appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, is not changed. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.
* [bpo-31500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=31500): Default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.
* [bpo-1612262](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=1612262): IDLE module browser now shows nested classes and functions.
  Original patches for code and tests by Guilherme Polo and Cheryl Sabella,

  Py\_GetPath() and Py\_SetPath()
* [bpo-30697](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30697): The `PyExc_RecursionErrorInst` singleton is removed and
  `PyErr_NormalizeException()` does not use it anymore. This singleton is
  persistent and its members being never cleared may cause a segfault during
  finalization of the interpreter. See also [bpo-22898](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22898).

  of the patch, on Linux and OS X. This means our signal delivery logic had
  defects (some signals could be lost).

* [bpo-27099](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27099): Convert IDLEâs built-in âextensionsâ to regular features.

  About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions.
  Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not
  good for maintenance. Hence the conversion.

  The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings for
  builtin features are now handled uniformly. Now, editing a binding in a
  keyset only affects its value in the keyset. All bindings are defined
  together in the system-specific default keysets in config-extensions.def.
  All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-extension.cfg. All take
  effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok.

  The affected events are â<<force-open-completions>>â, â<<expand-word>>â,
  â<<force-open-calltip>>â, â<<flash-paren>>â, â<<format-paragraph>>â,
  â<<run-module>>â, â<<check-module>>â, and â<<zoom-height>>â. Any (global)
  customizations made before 3.6.3 will not affect their keyset-specific
  customization after 3.6.3. and vice versa. Initial patch by Charles
  Wohlganger.

  inlines PyEval\_EvalFrameEx on non-debug shared builds. This broke the
  ability to use py-bt, py-up, and a few other Python-specific gdb
  integrations. The problem is fixed by only looking for
  \_PyEval\_EvalFrameDefault frames in python-gdb.py. Original patch by Bruno
  âPolacoâ Penteado.

*Release date: 2017-07-07*

### Security[Â¶](#id259 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30730](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30730): Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on
  Windows. Prevent passing other environment variables and command
  arguments.
* [bpo-30694](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30694): Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple
  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0âs fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesnât
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using `XML_SetHashSalt()`.
* [bpo-30500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30500): Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, `splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')` now correctly returns the
  `127.0.0.1` host, instead of treating `@evil.com` as the host in an
  authentication (`login@host`).

  `assert()` checks. Defaults to off. `--with-pydebug` implies
  `--with-assertions`.
* [bpo-28787](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=28787): Fix out-of-tree builds of Python when configured with
  `--with--dtrace`.
* [bpo-29243](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29243): Prevent unnecessary rebuilding of Python during `make test`,
  `make install` and some other make targets when configured with
  `--enable-optimizations`.

### Documentation[Â¶](#id267 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30176](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30176): Add missing attribute related constants in curses
  documentation.
* [bpo-30052](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30052): the link targets for [`bytes()`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray()`](../library/stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray") are
  now their respective type definitions, rather than the corresponding
  builtin function entries. Use [bytes](../library/functions.html#func-bytes) and
  [bytearray](../library/functions.html#func-bytearray) to reference the latter.

  In order to ensure this and future cross-reference updates are applied
  automatically, the daily documentation builds now disable the default
  output caching features in Sphinx.
* [bpo-26985](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26985): Add missing info of code object in inspect documentation.

### Tools/Demos[Â¶](#id268 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29367](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29367): python-gdb.py now supports also `method-wrapper`
  (`wrapperobject`) objects.

### Tests[Â¶](#id269 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30357](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30357): test\_thread: setUp() now uses support.threading\_setup() and
  support.threading\_cleanup() to wait until threads complete to avoid random
  side effects on following tests. Initial patch written by Grzegorz
  Grzywacz.
* [bpo-30197](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30197): Enhanced functions swap\_attr() and swap\_item() in the
  test.support module. They now work when delete replaced attribute or item
  inside the with statement. The old value of the attribute or item (or
  None if it doesnât exist) now will be assigned to the target of the âasâ
  clause, if there is one.

### Windows[Â¶](#id270 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30687](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30687): Locate msbuild.exe on Windows when building rather than
  vcvarsall.bat
* [bpo-30450](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30450): The build process on Windows no longer depends on Subversion,
  instead pulling external code from GitHub via a Python script. If Python
  3.6 is not found on the system (via `py -3.6`), NuGet is used to
  download a copy of 32-bit Python.

## Python 3.6.1 final[Â¶](#python-3-6-1-final "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2017-03-21*

### Core and Builtins[Â¶](#id271 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-29723](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29723): The `sys.path[0]` initialization change for [bpo-29139](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29139) caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing `__main__` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import
  locationâs parent directory to `sys.path`, and ensures no other
  `sys.path` entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import
  location named on the command line.

### Build[Â¶](#id272 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-27593](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27593): fix format of git information used in sys.version

  should raise TypeError when kwargs is not a dict. But it might cause segv
  when args=NULL and kwargs is not a dict.

  partial writes.
* [bpo-22115](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22115): Added methods trace\_add, trace\_remove and trace\_info in the
  tkinter.Variable class. They replace old methods trace\_variable, trace,
  trace\_vdelete and trace\_vinfo that use obsolete Tcl commands and might not
  work in future versions of Tcl. Fixed old tracing methods:
  trace\_vdelete() with wrong mode no longer break tracing, trace\_vinfo() now

* [bpo-27122](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27122): When an exception is raised within the context being managed by
  a contextlib.ExitStack() and one of the exit stack generators catches and
  raises it in a chain, do not re-raise the original exception when exiting,
  let the new chained one through. This avoids the PEP 479 bug described in

  holding the GIL.
* [bpo-26564](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26564): On error, the debug hooks on Python memory allocators now use
  the [`tracemalloc`](../library/tracemalloc.html#module-tracemalloc "tracemalloc: Trace memory allocations.") module to get the traceback where a memory block
  was allocated.
* [bpo-26558](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26558): The debug hooks on Python memory allocator
  [`PyObject_Malloc()`](../c-api/memory.html#c.PyObject_Malloc "PyObject_Malloc") now detect when functions are called without
  holding the GIL.
* [bpo-26516](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26516): Add [`PYTHONMALLOC`](../using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONMALLOC) environment variable to set the

  memory allocators when Python is configured without pymalloc.
* [bpo-26464](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26464): Fix str.translate() when string is ASCII and first replacements
  removes character, but next replacement uses a non-ASCII character or a
  string longer than 1 character. Regression introduced in Python 3.5.0.
* [bpo-22836](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22836): Ensure exception reports from PyErr\_Display() and
  PyErr\_WriteUnraisable() are sensible even when formatting them produces
  secondary errors. This affects the reports produced by
  sys.\_\_excepthook\_\_() and when \_\_del\_\_() raises an exception.

  PendingDeprecationWarning to DeprecationWarning. Patch by Anish Shah.
* [bpo-26204](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26204): The compiler now ignores all constant statements: bytes, str,
  int, float, complex, name constants (None, False, True), Ellipsis and
  ast.Constant; not only str and int. For example, `1.0` is now ignored in
  `def f(): 1.0`.

  (`*`) unpacking in function calls. Based on patch by Hagen FÃ¼rstenau
  and Daniel Urban.
* [bpo-26146](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26146): Add a new kind of AST node: `ast.Constant`. It can be used by
  external AST optimizers, but the compiler does not emit directly such
  node.
* [bpo-23601](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23601): Sped-up allocation of dict key objects by using Pythonâs small
  object allocator. (Contributed by Julian Taylor.)
* [bpo-18018](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18018): Import raises ImportError instead of SystemError if a relative
  import is attempted without a known parent package.
* [bpo-25843](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25843): When compiling code, donât merge constants if they are equal
  but have a different types. For example, `f1, f2 = lambda: 1, lambda:
  1.0` is now correctly compiled to two different functions: `f1()`
  returns `1` (`int`) and `f2()` returns `1.0` (`float`), even if
  `1` and `1.0` are equal.
* [bpo-26107](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26107): The format of the `co_lnotab` attribute of code objects

* [bpo-26154](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26154): Add a new private \_PyThreadState\_UncheckedGet() function to get
  the current Python thread state, but donât issue a fatal error if it is
  NULL. This new function must be used instead of accessing directly the
  \_PyThreadState\_Current variable. The variable is no more exposed since
  Python 3.5.1 to hide the exact implementation of atomic C types, to avoid
  compiler issues.
* [bpo-25791](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25791): If \_\_package\_\_ != \_\_spec\_\_.parent or if neither \_\_package\_\_ or
  \_\_spec\_\_ are defined then ImportWarning is raised.
* [bpo-22995](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22995): [UPDATE] Comment out the one of the pickleability tests in

  subclasses of list or dict and havenât implemented any pickle-related
  methods (\_\_reduce\_\_, \_\_reduce\_ex\_\_, \_\_getnewargs\_\_, \_\_getnewargs\_ex\_\_, or
  \_\_getstate\_\_), can no longer be pickled. Including memoryview.

  \_\_bytes\_\_, \_\_trunc\_\_, and \_\_float\_\_ returning instances of subclasses of
  bytes, int, and float to subclasses of bytes, int, and float
  correspondingly.
* [bpo-25630](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25630): Fix a possible segfault during argument parsing in functions
  that accept filesystem paths.
* [bpo-23564](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23564): Fixed a partially broken sanity check in the \_posixsubprocess
  internals regarding how fds\_to\_pass were passed to the child. The bug had
  no actual impact as subprocess.py already avoided it.

* [bpo-24802](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24802): Avoid buffer overreads when int(), float(), compile(), exec()
  and eval() are passed bytes-like objects. These objects are not
  necessarily terminated by a null byte, but the functions assumed they
  were.
* [bpo-25555](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25555): Fix parser and AST: fill lineno and col\_offset of âargâ node
  when compiling AST from Python objects.

  recursion limit is too low depending at the current recursion depth.
  Modify also the âlower-water markâ formula to make it monotonic. This mark
  is used to decide when the overflowed flag of the thread state is reset.

  function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy() function
  is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom() doesnât
  need such high-quality entropy.
* [bpo-9232](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=9232): Modify Pythonâs grammar to allow trailing commas in the argument
  list of a function declaration. For example, âdef f(\*, a = 3,): passâ is

* [bpo-25447](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25447): Copying the lru\_cache() wrapper object now always works,
  independently from the type of the wrapped object (by returning the
  original object unchanged).
* [bpo-25768](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25768): Have the functions in compileall return booleans instead of
  ints and add proper documentation and tests for the return values.
* [bpo-24103](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24103): Fixed possible use after free in ElementTree.XMLPullParser.
* [bpo-25860](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25860): os.fwalk() no longer skips remaining directories when error

* [bpo-25717](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25717): Restore the previous behaviour of tolerating most fstat()
  errors when opening files. This was a regression in 3.5a1, and stopped
  anonymous temporary files from working in special cases.
* [bpo-24903](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24903): Fix regression in number of arguments compileall accepts when
  â-dâ is specified. The check on the number of arguments has been dropped
  completely as it never worked correctly anyway.

  with time.tzset().
* [bpo-14285](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=14285): When executing a package with the âpython -m packageâ option,
  and package initialization fails, a proper traceback is now reported. The
  ârunpyâ module now lets exceptions from package initialization pass back
  to the caller, rather than raising ImportError.
* [bpo-19771](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19771): Also in runpy and the â-mâ option, omit the irrelevant message
  ââ¦ is a package and cannot be directly executedâ if the package could
  not even be initialized (e.g. due to a bad `*.pyc` file).
* [bpo-25177](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25177): Fixed problem with the mean of very small and very large
  numbers. As a side effect, statistics.mean and statistics.variance should

  Py\_ssize\_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT\_MAX. This resolves a
  regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than
  2 or 4 GiB. The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress()
  max\_length parameter, the zlib.decompress() bufsize parameter, and the
  zlib.Decompress.flush() length parameter.
* [bpo-25583](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25583): Avoid incorrect errors raised by os.makedirs(exist\_ok=True)

  the following modules: calendar, csv, enum, fileinput, ftplib, logging,
  optparse, tarfile, threading and wave. Also added a
  test.support.check\_\_all\_\_() helper. Patches by Jacek KoÅodziej, Mauro S.
  M. Rodrigues and Joel Taddei.
* [bpo-25590](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25590): In the Readline completer, only call getattr() once per

* [bpo-20640](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20640): Add tests for idlelib.configHelpSourceEdit. Patch by Saimadhav
  Heblikar.
* In the âIDLE-console differencesâ section of the IDLE doc, clarify how
  running with IDLE affects sys.modules and the standard streams.
* [bpo-25507](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25507): fix incorrect change in IOBinding that prevented printing.
  Augment IOBinding htest to include all major IOBinding functions.

  MARK in README.txt and open this and NEWS.txt with âasciiâ. Re-encode
  CREDITS.txt to utf-8 and open it with âutf-8â.
* [bpo-15348](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15348): Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.
* [bpo-24455](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24455): Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.
* Change âThe programâ to âYour programâ in an IDLE âkill program?â message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

* [bpo-24782](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24782): Extension configuration is now a tab in the IDLE Preferences
  dialog rather than a separate dialog. The former tabs are now a sorted
  list. Patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-22726](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22726): Re-activate the config dialog help button with some content
  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24820): IDLE now has an âIDLE Darkâ built-in text color theme. It is
  more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, â¦ are still green, red, orange, â¦ . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the âSave as New
  Custom Themeâ button and enter a new name, such as âCustom Darkâ. The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.
* [bpo-25224](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25224): README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  âIDLEâ now means âIntegrated Development and Learning Environmentâ.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24820): Users can now set breakpoint colors in Settings -> Custom
  Highlighting. Original patch by Mark Roseman.

  by a tk regression. Initial patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-24988](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24988): Idle ScrolledList context menus (used in debugger) now work on
  Mac Aqua. Patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-24801](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24801): Make right-click for context menu work on Mac Aqua. Patch by
  Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-25173](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25173): Associate tkinter messageboxes with a specific widget. For Mac
  OSX, make them a âsheetâ. Patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-25198](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25198): Enhance the initial html viewer now used for Idle Help.
  Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman). Give code
  snippet a very Sphinx-like light blueish-gray background. Re-use initial
  width and height set by users for shell and editor. When the Table of

## Python 3.5.5 release candidate 1[Â¶](#python-3-5-5-release-candidate-1 "Permalink to this headline")

*Release date: 2018-01-23*

### Security[Â¶](#id361 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32551](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32551): The `sys.path[0]` initialization change for [bpo-29139](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29139) caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing `__main__` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. This is considered a potential security issue, as it may lead to
  privileged processes unexpectedly loading code from user controlled
  directories in situations where that was not previously the case.

  The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import locationâs
  parent directory to `sys.path`, and ensures no other `sys.path`
  entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import location
  named on the command line. (Originally reported as [bpo-29723](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29723) against
  Python 3.6rc1, but it was missed at the time that the then upcoming Python
  3.5.4 release would also be affected)
* [bpo-30657](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30657): Fixed possible integer overflow in PyBytes\_DecodeEscape,
  CVE-2017-1000158. Original patch by Jay Bosamiya; rebased to Python 3 by

  doesnât call `PyObject_GC_UnTrack()`.

### Library[Â¶](#id363 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-32072](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=32072): Fixed issues with binary plists:

  + Fixed saving bytearrays.
  + Identical objects will be saved only once.

*Release date: 2017-07-23*

### Security[Â¶](#id365 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-30730](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30730): Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on
  Windows. Prevent passing other environment variables and command
  arguments.
* [bpo-30694](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30694): Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple
  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0âs fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesnât
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using `XML_SetHashSalt()`.
* [bpo-30500](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=30500): Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, `splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')` now correctly returns the
  `127.0.0.1` host, instead of treating `@evil.com` as the host in an
  authentication (`login@host`).
* [bpo-29591](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=29591): Update expat copy from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 to get fixes of

  value.

  Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(),
  which is specified as taking microsecond-resolution intervals. However, on
  some platform, our conversion routine could convert 1e-6 into a zero
  interval, therefore disabling the timer instead of (re-)scheduling it.

  Python 3.5.1 to hide the exact implementation of atomic C types, to avoid
  compiler issues.
* [bpo-26194](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=26194): Deque.insert() gave odd results for bounded deques that had
  reached their maximum size. Now an IndexError will be raised when

  \_\_getstate\_\_), can no longer be pickled. Including memoryview.
* [bpo-20440](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20440): Massive replacing unsafe attribute setting code with special
  macro Py\_SETREF.
* [bpo-25766](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25766): Special method \_\_bytes\_\_() now works in str subclasses.

  awaitable that resolves to an asynchronous iterator, the asynchronous
  iterator should be returned directly. Doing the former will trigger a
  PendingDeprecationWarning.

  de Gaye.
* [bpo-22359](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22359): Disable the rules for running \_freeze\_importlib and pgen when
  cross-compiling. The output of these programs is normally saved with the
  source code anyway, and is still regenerated when doing a native build.
  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.
* [bpo-27229](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=27229): Fix the cross-compiling pgen rule for in-tree builds. Patch by

  link time optimizations at build time during a make profile-opt. Some
  compilers and toolchains are known to not produce stable code when using
  LTO, be sure to test things thoroughly before relying on it. It can
  provide a few % speed up over profile-opt alone.

  that accept filesystem paths.
* [bpo-23564](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23564): Fixed a partially broken sanity check in the \_posixsubprocess
  internals regarding how fds\_to\_pass were passed to the child. The bug had
  no actual impact as subprocess.py already avoided it.
* [bpo-25388](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25388): Fixed tokenizer crash when processing undecodable source code
  with a null byte.
* [bpo-25462](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25462): The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most
  operations in C implementation of OrderedDict.
* [bpo-22995](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22995): Default implementation of \_\_reduce\_\_ and \_\_reduce\_ex\_\_ now
  rejects builtin types with not defined \_\_new\_\_.
* [bpo-25555](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25555): Fix parser and AST: fill lineno and col\_offset of âargâ node
  when compiling AST from Python objects.
* [bpo-24802](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24802): Avoid buffer overreads when int(), float(), compile(), exec()
  and eval() are passed bytes-like objects. These objects are not
  necessarily terminated by a null byte, but the functions assumed they
  were.
* [bpo-24726](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24726): Fixed a crash and leaking NULL in repr() of OrderedDict that
  was mutated by direct calls of dict methods.

  garbage collected.
* [bpo-25274](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25274): sys.setrecursionlimit() now raises a RecursionError if the new
  recursion limit is too low depending at the current recursion depth.
  Modify also the âlower-water markâ formula to make it monotonic. This mark
  is used to decide when the overflowed flag of the thread state is reset.

  function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy() function
  is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom() doesnât
  need such high-quality entropy.
* [bpo-25182](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25182): The stdprinter (used as sys.stderr before the io module is
  imported at startup) now uses the backslashreplace error handler.

  Py\_ssize\_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT\_MAX. This resolves a
  regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than
  2 or 4 GiB. The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress()
  max\_length parameter, the zlib.decompress() bufsize parameter, and the

  reuseaddr socket options to be set prior to binding the socket. Mirroring
  the existing asyncio create\_server method the reuseaddr option for
  datagram sockets defaults to True if the O/S is âposixâ (except if the
  platform is Cygwin). Patch by Chris Laws.
* [bpo-25304](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25304): Add asyncio.run\_coroutine\_threadsafe(). This lets you submit a

  of datetime.datetime: microseconds are now rounded to nearest with ties
  going to nearest even integer (ROUND\_HALF\_EVEN), instead of being rounding
  towards minus infinity (ROUND\_FLOOR). Itâs important that these methods
  use the same rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) ==
  datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t). It also the rounding mode used by
  round(float) for example.

* [bpo-24684](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24684): socket.socket.getaddrinfo() now calls
  PyUnicode\_AsEncodedString() instead of calling the encode() method of the
  host, to handle correctly custom string with an encode() method which
  doesnât return a byte string. The encoder of the IDNA codec is now called
  directly instead of calling the encode() method of the string.
* [bpo-25060](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25060): Correctly compute stack usage of the BUILD\_MAP opcode.
* [bpo-24857](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24857): Comparing call\_args to a long sequence now correctly returns a

  of stdin (0), stdout (1) or stderr (2) is closed while Python is creating
  sys.stdin, sys.stdout and sys.stderr objects. These attributes are now set
  to None if the creation of the object failed, instead of raising an
  OSError exception. Initial patch written by Marco Paolini.
* [bpo-24992](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24992): Fix error handling and a race condition (related to garbage

### IDLE[Â¶](#id411 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-15348](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=15348): Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.
* [bpo-24455](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24455): Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.
* Change âThe programâ to âYour programâ in an IDLE âkill program?â message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.
* [bpo-24750](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24750): Improve the appearance of the IDLE editor window status bar.

* [bpo-24782](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24782): Extension configuration is now a tab in the IDLE Preferences

  list. Patch by Mark Roseman.

  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24820): IDLE now has an âIDLE Darkâ built-in text color theme. It is
  more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, â¦ are still green, red, orange, â¦ . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the âSave as New
  Custom Themeâ button and enter a new name, such as âCustom Darkâ. The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.
* [bpo-25224](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25224): README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  âIDLEâ now means âIntegrated Development and Learning Environmentâ.
* [bpo-24820](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24820): Users can now set breakpoint colors in Settings -> Custom
  Highlighting. Original patch by Mark Roseman.

  background, as configured by users, on all systems. Found items are now
  always highlighted on Windows. Initial patch by Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-24570](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24570): Idle: make calltip and completion boxes appear on Macs affected

* [bpo-24988](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24988): Idle ScrolledList context menus (used in debugger) now work on
  Mac Aqua. Patch by Mark Roseman.

  Mark Roseman.
* [bpo-25173](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25173): Associate tkinter messageboxes with a specific widget. For Mac

* [bpo-25219](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=25219): Update doc for Idle command line options. Some were missing and
  notes were not correct.
* [bpo-24861](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24861): Most of idlelib is private and subject to change. Use
  idleib.idle.\* to start Idle. See idlelib.\_\_init\_\_.\_\_doc\_\_.

* [bpo-16893](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16893): Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new
  idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks
  better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The
  tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Mark Roseman.
  The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are
  deprecated.
* [bpo-24199](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=24199): Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.

  than the Expressions chapter. Added details of comparing range() objects,

  result of sendto() instead of the C int type.
* [bpo-23618](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23618): [`socket.socket.connect()`](../library/socket.html#socket.socket.connect "socket.socket.connect") now waits until the connection
  completes instead of raising [`InterruptedError`](../library/exceptions.html#InterruptedError "InterruptedError") if the connection is
  interrupted by signals, signal handlers donât raise an exception and the
  socket is blocking or has a timeout. [`socket.socket.connect()`](../library/socket.html#socket.socket.connect "socket.socket.connect") still

  (empty) definition of the methoddef macro: itâs only generated once, even
  if Argument Clinic processes the same symbol multiple times, and itâs
  emitted at the end of all processing rather than immediately after the
  first use.

  now is non-modifiable mapping.
* [bpo-23792](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23792): Ignore KeyboardInterrupt when the pydoc pager is active. This
  mimics the behavior of the standard unix pagers, and prevents pipepager

  now retried when interrupted by a signal not in the *sigset* parameter, if
  the signal handler does not raise an exception. signal.sigtimedwait()
  recomputes the timeout with a monotonic clock when it is retried.
* [bpo-23001](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23001): Few functions in modules mmap, ossaudiodev, socket, ssl, and

  importing a test module is now picklable.
* [bpo-22181](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22181): On Linux, os.urandom() now uses the new getrandom() syscall if
  available, syscall introduced in the Linux kernel 3.17. It is more
  reliable and more secure, because it avoids the need of a file descriptor
  and waits until the kernel has enough entropy.
* [bpo-2211](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=2211): Updated the implementation of the http.cookies.Morsel class.
  Setting attributes key, value and coded\_value directly now is deprecated.
  update() and setdefault() now transform and check keys. Comparing for
  equality now takes into account attributes key, value and coded\_value.
  copy() now returns a Morsel, not a dict. repr() now contains all

  positional-or-keyword arguments passed as keyword arguments become
  keyword-only.
* [bpo-20334](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20334): inspect.Signature and inspect.Parameter are now hashable.
  Thanks to Antony Lee for bug reports and suggestions.

  editor window with a filename. When Class Browser is requested otherwise,
  from a shell, output window, or âUntitledâ editor, Idle no longer displays
  an error box. It now pops up an Open Module box (Alt+M). If a valid name
  is entered and a module is opened, a corresponding browser is also opened.
* [bpo-4832](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=4832): Save As to type Python files automatically adds .py to the name
  you enter (even if your system does not display it). Some systems
  automatically add .txt when type is Text files.

  instead relying on OpenSSL source being configured and ready to build.
  The `PCbuild\build_ssl.py` script has been re-written and re-named to
  `PCbuild\prepare_ssl.py`, and takes care of configuring OpenSSL source
  for both 32 and 64 bit platforms. OpenSSL sources obtained from
  svn.python.org will always be pre-configured and ready to build.
* [bpo-21037](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21037): Add a build option to enable AddressSanitizer support.
* [bpo-19962](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=19962): The Windows build process now creates âpython.batâ in the root

  tests, compatible with NumPyâs NPY\_RELAXED\_STRIDES\_CHECKING compilation
  flag. Previously the function reported false negatives for corner cases.
* [bpo-22079](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22079): PyType\_Ready() now checks that statically allocated type has no
  dynamically allocated bases.

  PyObject\_Calloc(), \_PyObject\_GC\_Calloc(). bytes(int) is now using
  `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` for large objects which is faster and
  use less memory.
* [bpo-20942](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20942): PyImport\_ImportFrozenModuleObject() no longer sets \_\_file\_\_ to
  match what importlib does; this affects \_frozen\_importlib as well as any
  module loaded using imp.init\_frozen().

* [bpo-20079](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20079): The makelocalealias.py script now can parse the SUPPORTED file
  from glibc sources and supports command line options for source paths.
* [bpo-22201](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22201): Command-line interface of the zipfile module now correctly
  extracts ZIP files with directory entries. Patch by Ryan Wilson.
* [bpo-22120](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22120): For functions using an unsigned integer return converter,
  Argument Clinic now generates a cast to that type for the comparison to -1
  in the generated code. (This suppresses a compilation warning.)
* [bpo-18974](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=18974): Tools/scripts/diff.py now uses argparse instead of optparse.
* [bpo-21906](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21906): Make Tools/scripts/md5sum.py work in Python 3. Patch by Zachary
  Ware.
* [bpo-21629](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21629): Fix Argument Clinicâs ââconvertersâ feature.
* Add support for `yield from` to 2to3.
* Add support for the PEP 465 matrix multiplication operator to 2to3.
* [bpo-16047](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=16047): Fix module exception list and \_\_file\_\_ handling in freeze.
  Patch by Meador Inge.
* [bpo-11824](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=11824): Consider ABI tags in freeze. Patch by Meador Inge.
* [bpo-20535](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=20535): PYTHONWARNING no longer affects the run\_tests.py script. Patch
  by Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis.

### Windows[Â¶](#id469 "Permalink to this headline")

* [bpo-23260](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=23260): Update Windows installer
* The bundled version of Tcl/Tk has been updated to 8.6.3. The most visible
  result of this change is the addition of new native file dialogs when
  running on Windows Vista or newer. See Tcl/Tkâs TIP 432 for more
  information. Also, this version of Tcl/Tk includes support for Windows
  10.
* [bpo-17896](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17896): The Windows build scripts now expect external library sources
  to be in `PCbuild\..\externals` rather than `PCbuild\..\..`.
* [bpo-17717](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=17717): The Windows build scripts now use a copy of NASM pulled from
  svn.python.org to build OpenSSL.
* [bpo-21907](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=21907): Improved the batch scripts provided for building Python.
* [bpo-22644](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22644): The bundled version of OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.1j.
* [bpo-10747](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=10747): Use versioned labels in the Windows start menu. Patch by Olive
  Kilburn.
* [bpo-22980](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=22980): .pyd files with a version and platform tag (for example,
  â.cp35-win32.pydâ) will now be loaded in preference to those without tags.

[slackware-security]  python (SSA:2019-293-01)

New python packages are available for Slackware 14.0, 14.1, 14.2, and -current
to fix security issues.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/python-2.7.17-i586-1_slack14.2.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes bugs and security issues:
  Update vendorized expat library version to 2.2.8.
  Disallow URL paths with embedded whitespace or control characters into the
  underlying http client request. Such potentially malicious header injection
  URLs now cause an httplib.InvalidURL exception to be raised.
  Avoid file reading by disallowing ``local-file://`` and ``local_file://``
  URL schemes in :func:`urllib.urlopen`, :meth:`urllib.URLopener.open` and
  :meth:`urllib.URLopener.retrieve`.
  For more information, see:
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15903>
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9740>
    <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9948>
  (* Security fix *)

Please simplify the fix. There is no need to check for `_urlopener` here. Just block all access to `local_file://` schema. We don't need special cases for subclasses or special instances.

If it does not check the instance type of self, all of overridden `open_local_file` method will be blocked.

will be okay?

like this

```
 self.assertRaises(IOError, DummyURLopener().open
            'local_file://example')
 self.assertRaises(IOError, DummyURLopener().open
            'local-file://example')

```

I think that it needs to check open\_local\_file is overridden.

What do you think?

I think it has to expect this test result.

```
def test_local_file_open(self):
        class DummyURLopener(urllib.URLopener):
            def open_local_file(self, url):
                return url

        class DummyURLopener2(urllib.URLopener):
            def open_test(self, url):
                return url

        opener = DummyURLopener()
        opener2 = DummyURLopener2()

        for url in ('local-file://example', 'local_file://example'):
            self.assertEqual(opener.open(url), '//example')
            self.assertRaises(IOError, urllib.urlopen, url)
            self.assertRaises(IOError, opener2.open, url)
        self.assertEqual(opener2.open('test://example'), '//example')

```

but Considering the overriding method and instance type check was complex.

If you have a better idea. let me know.

I think it has to expect this test result.

```
def test_local_file_open(self):
        class DummyURLopener(urllib.URLopener):
            def open_local_file(self, url):
                return url

        class DummyURLopener2(urllib.URLopener):
            def open_test(self, url):
                return url

        opener = DummyURLopener()
        opener2 = DummyURLopener2()

        for url in ('local-file://example', 'local_file://example'):
            self.assertEqual(opener.open(url), '//example')
            self.assertRaises(IOError, urllib.urlopen, url)
            self.assertRaises(IOError, opener2.open, url)
        self.assertEqual(opener2.open('test://example'), '//example')

```

but Considering the overriding method and instance type check was complex.

If you have a better idea. let me know.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Another fix is to rename the open\_local\_file() as \_open\_local\_file(). But... In Python 2.7, there is a risk that the method is called directly in 3rd party code for whatever reason :-(

Why do you compare function objects instead of simply `name == "open_local_file"`?

If someone rename `open_local_file()` method and also forgets to modify `name == "open_local_file"`, it may be bypassed.

So I made the mitigation compare the object to raise syntax error.

Should I do change back?

I agree with you. I also considered renaming the `open_local_file()`. I think that this fix can guarantees availability to the developers who want to override this method. But I chose another fix to minimize side effects for third party codes.

Yes. I will do it. I want suggest you other fix.

```
        if not hasattr(self, name):
            if proxy:
                return self.open_unknown_proxy(proxy, fullurl, data)
            else:
                return self.open_unknown(fullurl, data)
        if name == 'open_local_file':
                raise IOError, ('url error', 'invalid url type', urltype)
        try:

```

I think that it is better to raise exception with explicit error message for developers to overriding `open_local_file()`.

they can easily recognize `local_file` is invalid type.

What do you think about it?

or should I use `open_unknown()`?

```
if not hasattr(self, name) or \
    name == 'open_local_file':

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129346#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-03-15 06:13:28 UTC  ``` rh#1688543  A vulnerability was found in Python 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2. An improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization could lead to an Information Disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname) in the urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse components. A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-04-03 11:41:01 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.2. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to [CVE-2019-9740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9740) query string issue.  Reference: <https://bugs.python.org/issue35906>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-04-03 12:06:22 UTC  ``` Created python-urllib3 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1695599](show_bug.cgi?id=1695599 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2019-9947 CVE-2019-9948 python-urllib3: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c2)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-04-03 12:06:55 UTC  ``` Created python3-urllib3 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1695600](show_bug.cgi?id=1695600 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2019-9947 CVE-2019-9948 python3-urllib3: various flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c3)  Victor Stinner    2019-04-10 12:40:28 UTC  ``` The main Python issue became <https://bugs.python.org/issue30458> which is a superseder of multiple issues.

The fix for [CVE-2019-9740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9740) (<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12755/files>) does not correctly cover the case when the CRLF sequences are in the hostname part of the URL. However, when that is the case, glibc getaddrinfo() function should return an error when trying to resolve the invalid hostname, assuming glibc is not vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-10739). When glibc is still vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-10739), a proper fix in python is required to properly validate the hostname part of the URL and to prevent CRLF sequences injection.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c19)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-07-10 08:31:37 UTC  ``` This flaws has been fixed with the same patch used for [CVE-2019-9740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9740), which is: <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c4e671eec20dfcb29b18596a89ef075f826c9f96> [master] <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b7378d77289c911ca6a0c0afaf513879002df7d5> [master] <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bb8071a4cae5ab3fe321481dd3d73662ffb26052> [python-2.7]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c20)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-07-10 08:41:47 UTC  ``` Reference: <https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/http-header-injection2.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:04:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2030 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2030](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2030)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 20:38:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3335 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3335](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3335)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 21:06:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3520 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3520](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3520)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-06 09:45:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2019:3725 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3725)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-01 08:34:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:1268 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1268](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1268)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-07 09:33:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2020:1346 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1346](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1346)   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-14 17:39:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:1462 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1462](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1462)   ``` |  |

Please simplify the fix. There is no need to check for `_urlopener` here. Just block all access to `local_file://` schema. We don't need special cases for subclasses or special instances.

Sorry, something went wrong.

If it does not check the instance type of self, all of overridden `open_local_file` method will be blocked.

will be okay?

like this

```
 self.assertRaises(IOError, DummyURLopener().open
            'local_file://example')
 self.assertRaises(IOError, DummyURLopener().open
            'local-file://example')

```

I think that it needs to check open\_local\_file is overridden.

What do you think?

I think it has to expect this test result.

```
def test_local_file_open(self):
        class DummyURLopener(urllib.URLopener):
            def open_local_file(self, url):
                return url

        class DummyURLopener2(urllib.URLopener):
            def open_test(self, url):
                return url

        opener = DummyURLopener()
        opener2 = DummyURLopener2()

        for url in ('local-file://example', 'local_file://example'):
            self.assertEqual(opener.open(url), '//example')
            self.assertRaises(IOError, urllib.urlopen, url)
            self.assertRaises(IOError, opener2.open, url)
        self.assertEqual(opener2.open('test://example'), '//example')

```

but Considering the overriding method and instance type check was complex.

If you have a better idea. let me know.

Another fix is to rename the open\_local\_file() as \_open\_local\_file(). But... In Python 2.7, there is a risk that the method is called directly in 3rd party code for whatever reason :-(

Why do you compare function objects instead of simply `name == "open_local_file"`?

[@tiran](https://github.com/tiran)

If someone rename `open_local_file()` method and also forgets to modify `name == "open_local_file"`, it may be bypassed.

So I made the mitigation compare the object to raise syntax error.

Should I do change back?

I agree with you. I also considered renaming the `open_local_file()`. I think that this fix can guarantees availability to the developers who want to override this method. But I chose another fix to minimize side effects for third party codes.

Yes. I will do it. I want suggest you other fix.

```
        if not hasattr(self, name):
            if proxy:
                return self.open_unknown_proxy(proxy, fullurl, data)
            else:
                return self.open_unknown(fullurl, data)
        if name == 'open_local_file':
                raise IOError, ('url error', 'invalid url type', urltype)
        try:

```

I think that it is better to raise exception with explicit error message for developers to overriding `open_local_file()`.

they can easily recognize `local_file` is invalid type.

What do you think about it?

or should I use `open_unknown()`?

```
if not hasattr(self, name) or \
    name == 'open_local_file':

```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1718388#c0)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-06-07 15:43:57 UTC  ``` A security regression for [CVE-2019-9636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9636) was discovered in python's functions urllib.parse.urlsplit and urllib.parse.urlparse, introduced with commit d537ab0ff9767ef024f26246899728f0116b1ec3. No upstream python version is affected by this regression but the vulnerable commit may already have been included downstream as part of the original fix for [CVE-2019-9636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9636).  Affected python versions ignore the user/password part before `@` in the netloc component of a URL, thus it still allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability as in [CVE-2019-9636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9636). Those functions do not properly handle URLs encoded with Punycode/Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA), which may result in a wrong domain name (specifically the netloc component of URL - user@domain:port) being returned by those functions. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Package        : python3.4
Version        : 3.4.2-1+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-9948

The urllib library in Python ships support for a second, not well known
URL scheme for accessing local files ("local_file://"). This scheme can
be used to circumvent protections that try to block local file access
and only block the well-known "file://" schema. This update addresses
the vulnerability by disallowing the "local_file://" URL scheme.

This update also fixes another regresssion introduced in the update
issued as DLA-1835-1 that broke installation of libpython3.4-testsuite.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
3.4.2-1+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.4 packages.

For the detailed security status of python3.4 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python3.4>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

                 CVE-2020-14422
Debian Bug     : 924072 921064 940901

Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language.

CVE-2018-20406

    Modules/_pickle.c has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT
    value that is mishandled during a "resize to twice the size"
    attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only
    relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or
    hundreds of gigabytes of data.

CVE-2018-20852

    http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in
    Lib/http/cookiejar.py does not correctly validate the domain: it
    can be tricked into sending existing cookies to the wrong
    server. An attacker may abuse this flaw by using a server with a
    hostname that has another valid hostname as a suffix (e.g.,
    pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com). When a
    program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an HTTP
    connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can
    be leaked to the attacker.

CVE-2019-5010

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the X509
    certificate parser. A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause
    a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An
    attacker can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted
    certificates to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit,
    urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted
    URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or
    authentication data and send that information to a different host
    than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP
    header or a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed
    by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the
    CVE-2019-9740 query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

    urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
    file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
    urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

    A security regression was discovered in python, which still allows
    an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
    password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
    URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind
    of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide
    specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related
    information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a
    different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been
    correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the
    application.

CVE-2019-16056

    The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain
    multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module
    and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a
    message could be tricked into accepting an email address that
    should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340;
    however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

CVE-2019-16935

    The documentation XML-RPC server has XSS via the server_title
    field. This occurs in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py. If set_server_title is
    called with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered
    to clients that visit the http URL for this server.

CVE-2019-18348

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This
    is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the
    CVE-2019-9947 path string issue

CVE-2020-8492

    Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
    urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

CVE-2020-14422

    Lib/ipaddress.py improperly computes hash values in the
    IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a
    remote attacker to cause a denial of service if an application is
    affected by the performance of a dictionary containing
    IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface objects, and this attacker can
    cause many dictionary entries to be created.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.3-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.5 packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| Gregory commented my master PR:  "This text doesn't make sense as written. "as disallowing the unnecessary URL scheme" says nothing. WHAT url scheme did we just break our users applications by refusing to support? Those need to be listed in the NEWS entry." <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/13474/files#r286726212>  I wrote this PR to clarify which scheme is rejected.  [@gpshead](https://github.com/gpshead) [@tirkarthi](https://github.com/tirkarthi) [@push0ebp](https://github.com/push0ebp): Would it sound better said like that?  Once this PR will be merged, I will also update the NEWS entry in 2.7 and 3.7, and then update my 3.5 and 3.6 backports. |
