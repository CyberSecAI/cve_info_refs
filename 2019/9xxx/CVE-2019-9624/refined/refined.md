Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-9624

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the "Upload and Download" module of Webmin versions 1.900 and earlier.  This allows an authenticated user with the necessary permissions to upload a malicious file and then execute arbitrary commands by exploiting the `show.cgi` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Authenticated users with "Upload and Download" privileges can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The vulnerability allows the uploading of arbitrary files to the server, specifically the overwriting of application files, which can lead to remote code execution.
- **Insufficient Privilege Checks:** The vulnerability arises because the upload functionality does not properly validate the type or content of the file being uploaded and doesn't prevent overriding existing files.
- **Insecure Use of PATH_INFO:** The `show.cgi` script uses `PATH_INFO` unsafely, allowing for command injection via specially crafted URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with root privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:**  An attacker could potentially gain complete control over the affected server.
- **Data Breach/Theft:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data stored on the compromised server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Webmin web interface.
- **File Upload:** A malicious CGI script is uploaded via the upload functionality.
- **Command Injection:** Command execution is achieved by crafting a malicious URL that utilizes `PATH_INFO` to inject commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid Webmin credentials with "Upload and Download" permissions and optionally "Running Processes" (proc) privilege to determine the upload directory.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Webmin web interface.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Webmin Version:** The attacker needs to target a Webmin instance running a vulnerable version (1.900 or lower).

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit involves uploading a specially crafted `show.cgi` file, which contains the vulnerable code and then triggering the execution of the malicious file through a crafted URL with a command injected in the `PATH_INFO`.
- The attacker can use the "Running Processes" privilege to identify the correct directory to upload the malicious file to, but the exploit can also rely on a default installation path to trigger the exploit, through the `GUESSUPLOAD` option in the metasploit module.
- The provided exploit targets Webmin versions 1.900 and lower on Unix systems and has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.
- The Metasploit module automates the process of exploiting this vulnerability.
