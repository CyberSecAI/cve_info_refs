{
  "CVE-2019-9147": {

    "root_cause": "The function `parseViewName` incorrectly parses view names containing more than one dash character.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Clickjacking vulnerability due to improper parsing of view names."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick a victim into modifying settings, importing keys, exporting private keys, or adding web pages to the whitelist.",
    "attack_vectors": "Embedding the settings page in an iframe, then tricking the user into interacting with it.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a victim into visiting a web page and interact with it."
