  "vulnerability": "Blind SSRF in Prometheus Integration",
  "root_cause": "Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue in the Prometheus integration.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "The Prometheus integration checks if the provided domain points to an external IP address during configuration.",
    "The integration doesn't re-validate the domain's IP address before using it later."
  ],
  "impact": "Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). An attacker can cause the GitLab server to make requests to internal IP addresses after the initial check by changing the DNS record of the configured domain.",
    "attack_vectors": [
    "The attacker configures a Prometheus service integration with a domain name pointing to an external IP.",
    "After the initial external IP check, the attacker changes the domain's DNS record to point to an internal IP.",
     "The GitLab server will then make a request to that internal IP address, leading to the SSRF vulnerability."
   ],
  "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to configure a Prometheus service integration and control the DNS records of the domain used in the integration."
