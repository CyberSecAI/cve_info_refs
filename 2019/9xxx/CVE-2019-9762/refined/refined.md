The provided content describes two distinct vulnerabilities found in the phpshe project: a blind XXE vulnerability and an SQL Injection vulnerability.

**1. Blind XXE Vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `pe_getxml` function within `include/function/global.func.php`. This function uses `simplexml_load_string()` to parse XML data received from `php://input`. If the libxml library version is older than 2.9.0, external entities will be parsed by default, leading to XXE.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The use of `simplexml_load_string()` without proper sanitization or disabling of external entity loading when parsing untrusted XML data.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server's file system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted XML payload to `/include/plugin/payment/wechat/notify_url.php` via HTTP POST request with `Content-Type: application/xml`. The payload includes an external entity definition that uses `php://filter` to read the contents of a file which is then sent to a controlled DNS server via the `http://dnslog.com` domain
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.

**2. SQL Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is located in `include/plugin/payment/alipay/pay.php`. The `$order_id` parameter is directly incorporated into SQL queries as a table name, without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The direct concatenation of user-controlled input ($order_id) into a SQL query allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*    **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database. The provided example demonstrates how to extract database information like the current user.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious request to `/include/plugin/payment/alipay/pay.php` with a crafted `id` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate query parameters.

Both vulnerabilities are present in `phpshe1.7`, and both can be exploited without authentication.
