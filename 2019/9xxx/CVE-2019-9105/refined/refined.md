Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of authentication and authorization checks for certain API endpoints in the SAET TEBE Small Supervisor web application. This allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive data and functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated API Calls:** The `REST_API.php` endpoint allows access to sensitive data like real-time events and the entire event database without any authentication. Specifically, the API endpoints `history/maxlastupdate` and `history/filter` are vulnerable. Also, the `alladminusers` API endpoint can be accessed without authentication and allows an attacker to retrieve the MD5 hashes of admin passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can monitor real-time access events, download the entire history of events, and obtain admin user information, including password hashes.
*   **System Compromise:** By obtaining the admin password hash and cracking it, the attacker can gain full administrative access to the system. This allows them to manipulate user permissions, control access terminals, tamper with access logs, and even upload malicious code (although exploitation of the upload functionality is hindered by path restrictions).
*   **Data Manipulation:** Once logged in, an attacker can alter the system's configuration and database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Requests:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by directly sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable `REST_API.php` endpoint, without needing to authenticate or log in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the SAET TEBE Small Supervisor's web application.
*   No prior authentication or privileges are needed to exploit the unauthenticated API calls.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text mentions a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability (CVE-2019-9106) in addition to the Unauthenticated API calls, but the focus here is on CVE-2019-9105.
*   The vendor was notified on February 6th, 2019.
*   The specific versions affected are: Product version: v05.01 build 1137, Webapp version: v04.68.
*   The provided content offers a detailed description of the attack vectors and the process to exploit the unauthenticated APIs. This is more detailed than what is typically available in a standard CVE description.
