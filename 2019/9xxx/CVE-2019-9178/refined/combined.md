# Private Merge Request in Public Project is Disclosed in Milestones

**[HackerOne report #453534](https://hackerone.com/reports/453534)** by ngalog on 2018-12-01:

**Summary:**
Consider the following settings, a public project limits its MR to members only, none of the MR should be accessible by the public, however a lack of access control leaks MR title in milestones detail tab.

## Steps To Reproduce (Fast):

* Visit [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/new-jjj-groupaaa/-/milestones/yo-promote-me?title=Yo+promote+me#tab-merge-requests)
* You should see a MR title in below, it is shown inside the tab [![Screen_Shot_2018-12-02_at_12.17.01_AM.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/932de06a32e7de08c150dddab9813d22e782a52c/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3435333533342f3338343036312f53637265656e5f53686f745f323031382d31322d30325f61745f31322e31372e30315f414d2e706e67)
* Click the link, it will show 404, meaning it is private, however the title of MR is still leaked in previous step

## Steps To Reproduce (Slow):

* Create a public project with ultimate access with following config [![Screen_Shot_2018-12-02_at_12.18.49_AM.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/b889d480ba92ccebcdb3b403b8ad66353ebafe17/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3435333533342f3338343036302f53637265656e5f53686f745f323031382d31322d30325f61745f31322e31382e34395f414d2e706e67)
* create a milestone
* create a MR and associate that with the milestone you created in last step
* As an unauthenticated user visit [https://gitlab.com/:project\_namespace/milestones](https://gitlab.com/%3Aproject_namespace/milestones)
* Click the milestone
* Click Merge Request in Tab
* Title of MR is disclosed in Tab

## Impact
