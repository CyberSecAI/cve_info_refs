Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control when displaying merge requests (MRs) within the milestones detail tab of a public project. Even if the MR is private and not accessible to the public, its title is still leaked within the milestone view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of private merge request titles to unauthenticated users through the milestones tab.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application fails to enforce access control policies when displaying MR information within the milestone context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can learn the titles of private merge requests. This could reveal sensitive information about ongoing development, code changes, or business strategies, even when the MR content itself is protected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed by navigating to a public project's milestone page and viewing the "Merge Requests" tab.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user visiting the public project's milestone page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to access the public project's page. No special privileges or authentication are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided report includes detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, both quickly and methodically.
- It also provides screenshots to demonstrate the issue, showing the leaked MR title within the milestone tab.
- The report highlights that the MR itself is inaccessible, leading to a 404 error if an attempt is made to view it. However, the title remains visible in the milestone tab.
