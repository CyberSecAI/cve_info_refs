{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `com/ofsoft/cms/admin/controller/cms/TemplateController.java` file, where the `save` function takes user-controlled parameters (`res_path`, `dirs`, `file_name`, `file_content`) and uses them to construct a file path and write arbitrary content into it. The `fileContent` is only sanitized for `<` and `>` which isn't sufficient to prevent file writes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary File Write",
      "Insufficient sanitization of user input"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can write arbitrary files to the server's file system, which can lead to various consequences, such as remote code execution (by writing a JSP file, for example), data exfiltration, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to `/admin/cms/template/getTemplates.html` with specific parameters `res_path`, `dirs`, `file_name` and `file_content`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the admin panel. The attacker needs to craft a malicious request with specific parameters for writing arbitrary content to a specified location"
