Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-9450

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the touch driver (specifically the fts driver) where a callback was not handling edge cases properly during string parsing. Specifically, when the input length exceeds the command buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds (OOB) read:** The vulnerability stems from the `fts` sysfs interface where input length is not validated against buffer size, leading to an out-of-bounds read when parsing commands.
- **Race condition:** The diagnostic core file operations were not thread-safe, allowing multiple user space processes/threads to potentially operate on the exposed diagnostic procfs/sysfs entries concurrently. This creates race conditions while allocating, freeing, or accessing global command buffers during diagnostic command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** An attacker could potentially elevate their privileges by exploiting the out-of-bounds read and race condition issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Sysfs Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `fts` sysfs interface. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted input to the touch driver through this interface.
- **Multiple User Space Processes:** The lack of thread safety in the touch driver's diagnostic core file operations means an attacker can exploit the race conditions by executing operations through multiple user space processes or threads simultaneously.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to interact with the touch driver through the sysfs interface.
- For the race condition, the attacker would require the ability to execute commands concurrently from multiple processes or threads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix addresses the corner case OOB array issues in the string parsing logic by validating input length, it also improves/simplifies the string parsing logic. Also, the fix makes the file operations thread-safe, mitigating the race condition.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a Moderate severity issue in the Pixel Update Bulletin.
- The fix for this vulnerability is associated with Android bug ID A-120141034.
