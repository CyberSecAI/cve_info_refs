{
  "CVE-2019-9169": {
    "description": "A read buffer overrun vulnerability exists in glibc's regexec.c. This vulnerability can be triggered with a specially crafted regular expression using the `grep -i` command. This can cause a heap-buffer-overflow.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the `proceed_next_node` function within `posix/regexec.c`. When processing a regular expression, the code can read past the end of the input buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Read buffer overrun"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a denial of service due to a crash. It may be possible to achieve arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided documents.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted regular expression",
       "Command line input"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted regular expression string as input to a vulnerable application utilizing the glibc regex functions."
