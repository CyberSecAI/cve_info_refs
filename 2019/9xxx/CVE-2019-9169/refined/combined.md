## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [glibc](/security/cves?package=glibc) - GNU C Library

## Details

Florian Weimer discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled

certain memory operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2017-12133](/security/CVE-2017-12133))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

SSE2-optimized memmove operations. A remote attacker could use this issue

to cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

([CVE-2017-18269](/security/CVE-2017-18269))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

pathname operations. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the

GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

([CVE-2018-11236](/security/CVE-2018-11236))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

AVX-512-optimized mempcpy operations. A remote attacker could use this

issue to cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-11237](/security/CVE-2018-11237))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

hostname loookups. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU

C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-19591](/security/CVE-2018-19591))

Jakub Wilk discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

memalign functions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU

C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2018-6485](/security/CVE-2018-6485))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly ignored the

LD\_PREFER\_MAP\_32BIT\_EXEC environment variable after security transitions. A

local attacker could use this issue to bypass ASLR restrictions.

([CVE-2019-19126](/security/CVE-2019-19126))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

regular expressions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ([CVE-2019-9169](/security/CVE-2019-9169))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

bit patterns. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C

Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. ([CVE-2020-10029](/security/CVE-2020-10029))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled certain

signal trampolines on PowerPC. A remote attacker could use this issue to

cause the GNU C Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-1751](/security/CVE-2020-1751))

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled tilde

expansion. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the GNU C

Library to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-1752](/security/CVE-2020-1752))

  -
  [2.30-0ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc/2.30-0ubuntu2.2)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc)
  -
  [2.27-3ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc/2.27-3ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc)
  -
  [2.23-0ubuntu11.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc/2.23-0ubuntu11.2)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

Hi,

    Latest `grep` (git commit 1019e6e) compiled with asan may cause a
heap-buffer-overflow when `-i` is specified.

Thanks for the bug report. I tracked it down to a read buffer overrun in glibc's
regexec.c and filed a bug report with a fix here:

<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24114>

glibc is frozen right now (it's just before the glibc 2.29 release), so most
likely the bug fix will appear in glibc 2.30. I plan to propagate the fix into
Gnulib (and therefore into grep) shortly after glibc 2.29 is released.

Thanks, Paul.
For the record, here's a small reproducer:

If I may beg to differ, I see no reason that GNULIB can't be
ahead of GLIBC. In particular for the benefit of programs that use
it, like grep/sed/gawk.

If necessary, I can copy/paste the change from the bug report, but
it'd be nicer if you'd just push it to GNULIB.

Thanks,

Arnold

The only reason is avoiding hassle: I'd have to decouple this gnulib
file from glibc now (which requires changing some other administrative
file), and then recouple it later. If this bug were important I'd be
inclined to do the extra work - but is it that important?

If the time period between the bug fix and GNULIB getting updated is
short (for some definition of "short") then it's not that important.
If it drags out, it becomes a hassle.

Do you have an ETA on when the fix will get pushed to GNULIB?

Thanks,

Arnold

Glibc is scheduled for release on February 1, and I plan to update glibc
and Gnulib soon after it's released (which may be a bit later than Feb. 1).

This is done now and the fix is propagated into Gnulib and grep, so I'm
marking the grep bug as done. If you're using a glibc version before
glibc 2.30 (which will not be out for months) you may need to
'./configure --with-included-regex' to get the fix.

Will there be a new grep release soon?

I don't have any plans. This bug doesn't seem to be that urgent to fix.

Hi,

    When latest sed (4.7.4-f8503-dirty) is compiled with ASan, it report a
heap-buffer-overflow when executing the following command.

      echo '0000000000000000000000000000' | ./sed -f c02.sed

c02.sed is attached (it seems ok when executing with the c02.sed content
directly, `echo '0000000000000000000000000000' | ./sed -f
"s000;s0\(..*\)*\1\(\)\S00"`).

This seems an issue in lib/regexec.c since we found GNU debbugs #34140 has
a similar case.

Hongxu

Hello,

Hongxu Chen reported a heap-buffer-overflow in gnulib's regexec code.

It can be reproduced with current sed using:

     git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/sed.git
     cd sed
     ./bootstrap && ./configure
     make build-asan

     echo 00000000000000000000000000 | ./sed/sed -E -e 's/(.*)*\1//'

The above 'sed' invocation is a simplified variation of Hongxu's report.

Details below:
