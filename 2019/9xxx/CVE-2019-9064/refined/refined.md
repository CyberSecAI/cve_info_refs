Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Path Traversal (or Directory Traversal) issue in the Cab Booking Script by PHP-Script-Mall. The software improperly handles user-supplied input when constructing file paths. Specifically, it fails to sanitize or neutralize special elements within the pathname which allows it to resolve to locations outside of the intended restricted directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal: The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Directory Listing: An attacker can bypass intended restrictions and view the contents of directories outside the intended upload folder. This can expose sensitive information about the application, its configuration, and potentially user data.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Direct URL manipulation: By manipulating the URL by removing the last part of the path (filename), the attacker can trigger directory listing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- Basic knowledge of web requests: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate URLs and observe server responses.
- Use of an intercepting proxy (optional): While not strictly required, a proxy tool such as Burp Suite can make it easier to identify and modify requests.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes a step-by-step guide on how to exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the URL and observing the directory listing response.
