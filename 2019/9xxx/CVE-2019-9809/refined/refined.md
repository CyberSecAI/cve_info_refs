Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is how Firefox handles error messages from FTP servers, specifically when those errors occur in the context of loading resources (like images) within a webpage. When an FTP server sends an error message, Firefox displays it in a modal alert box. This mechanism, while intended for providing feedback, was vulnerable to abuse.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Domain Modal Dialog Spoof:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can trigger these FTP error dialogs from a different domain, even when the FTP requests are made within the context of an HTML document on a separate domain (e.g., through an <img> tag). This allows the attacker to display misleading error messages.
*   **Lack of Error Message Sanitization:**  The FTP server's error message is displayed verbatim in the alert, without sanitization. This means the attacker has control over the displayed message's content, making it possible to craft messages that appear legitimate or are alarming to the user.
*   **Modal Dialog Blocking Behavior**: The modal dialogs are blocking, which means the user is unable to interact with the browser while they are open. This can be exploited to create denial of service attacks
*  **Multiple Popups**: The vulnerability could be triggered multiple times with multiple FTP resources on the page, leading to a flood of modal popups, effectively making the browser unusable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could render a user's browser unusable by flooding them with a large number of blocking modal dialogs.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker can craft misleading alert messages that appear as legitimate warnings from Firefox, potentially leading the user to take an action harmful to themselves (e.g., downloading and running malware).
*   **Spoofing**: Attackers can spoof security messages, making users believe their system is infected.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Forums/Blogs:** Embedding malicious FTP requests (e.g., in image tags) into web forums, blog comments, or any content where user-provided HTML is rendered.
*   **HTML Email:** Creating HTML emails that trigger FTP requests when viewed.
*  **Any Website**: Any website can be exploited to host a malicious page with FTP resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve FTP Responses:** The attacker needs to have control over an FTP server to send responses to the browser.
*   **Ability to Inject HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML into a context where the user's browser will render it (e.g. via web forum, blog, email).
*   **No user interaction**: The attack triggers when the page is loaded.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 66 and 67.
*   The bug report explicitly mentions that FTP is allowed to create window modal popups, which is a shared underlying problem with similar FTP issues.
* The fix was achieved by preventing the display of FTP server error messages in modal popups.
