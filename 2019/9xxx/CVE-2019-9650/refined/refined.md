Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-9650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The MyBB Upcoming Events Plugin version 1.32 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin displays upcoming calendar events on the forum index and portal page, but it does not properly sanitize the event names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (event names).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the event names, which will be executed in the browsers of users viewing the forum index or portal page.
- This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker adds a new calendar event through `calendar.php` page.
- The event name includes a malicious JavaScript payload, e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
- When other users visit pages where the calendar events are displayed (e.g., `index.php`), the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to add a new event to the calendar (likely requires an account).
- No special privileges beyond being able to interact with the calendar feature are needed to inject the malicious script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects version 1.32 of the "MyBB Upcoming Events" plugin.
- The fix is to update to version 1.33.
