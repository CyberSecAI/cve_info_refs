- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WebHMI utility in PHOENIX CONTACT RAD-80211-XD and RAD-80211-XD/HP-BUS devices allows execution of arbitrary OS commands due to improper neutralization of special elements in a command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-77) in the WebHMI component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary system-level commands with administrative privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A logged-in user can exploit the WebHMI utility to inject and execute OS commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the WebHMI utility.
