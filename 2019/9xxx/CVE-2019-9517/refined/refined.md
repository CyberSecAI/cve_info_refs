Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided documents:

**CVE-2019-9517**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Unconstrained internal data buffering in HTTP/2 implementations. The attacker exploits the difference between HTTP/2 flow control and TCP windowing. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window, allowing the server to send data, but keeps the TCP window closed. The server queues large responses and consumes resources.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    *   Unconstrained internal data buffering in HTTP/2 implementations.
    *   Lack of proper checks on the rate at which data is being buffered.
    *   Inefficient server-side queuing of large responses when the peer is not consuming them.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   Denial of service (DoS) due to excessive consumption of memory and CPU on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   A remote attacker sends a stream of HTTP/2 requests for a large response object
    *   The attacker manipulates HTTP/2 and TCP windows to cause the server to buffer data without sending it.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs the ability to establish HTTP/2 connections with the target server.
    *   The attacker must be able to manipulate HTTP/2 and TCP window sizes, which is a standard feature for HTTP/2 communication.

**Additional Details from Documents:**

*   The vulnerability is present in some HTTP/2 implementations, affecting various products like: `apache2`, `nodejs`, and  `netty`.
*   Fixes were implemented by updating the `http2` module to version 1.15.4 and updating `nghttp2` library to version 1.39.2.
*   Some vendors, like NetApp, stated that their products were not affected because they did not implement the vulnerable code or have the specific configuration required for exploitation.
*   Several vendors released patches for their affected products, including Red Hat, SUSE and openSUSE.
*   Some of the updates also fixed other HTTP/2 vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-9511, CVE-2019-9512, CVE-2019-9513, CVE-2019-9514, CVE-2019-9515, CVE-2019-9516 and CVE-2019-9518, which also relate to DoS attacks by exploiting HTTP/2 implementations.
*   Red Hat has rated this vulnerability as Important, using a CVSS base score of 7.5
