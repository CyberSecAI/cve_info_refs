Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `CanvasPattern` objects are handled within the `CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillText` method. Specifically, when a `CanvasPattern` is created using an image from a different domain (cross-origin), the same-origin policy is not enforced when that pattern is used as a fill style for text. This lack of security check in the `fillText` method makes it possible to use a cross-origin image via a CanvasPattern, and then draw the text using that pattern, without restrictions from CORS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the same-origin policy and read image data from different domains, violating expected web security protocols.
*   **Missing Security Check:** The code lacks a security check within the `fillText` method for `CanvasPattern` objects created from cross-origin sources before performing drawing operations, which allows the image data to leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Image Data Theft:** Attackers can steal image data from any domain and use it on their own sites, violating user privacy and potentially affecting intellectual property.
*   **Same-Origin Policy Violation**:  The core security measure for isolating web content is bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Cross-Origin Image Load:** The attacker loads an image from a target domain.
2.  **Create Canvas Pattern:** The attacker uses this image to create a `CanvasPattern` object.
3.  **Draw Text With Pattern:** The attacker uses the `fillText` method to draw text, setting the pattern as the fill style, where no security checks are done.
4.  **Extract Image Data:** Finally, the attacker can extract image data by using `toDataURL()` or similar methods on the modified canvas.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Script:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web page that can access the target's canvas.
*   **Target Website:** The attacker needs to know or have some way of loading images from a target domain they want to steal.
*   **No User Interaction Required**:  The attack is performed entirely through javascript and does not require any user interaction aside from navigating to the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**
The vulnerability is specifically found within the `fillText` method and how it processes CanvasPatterns. The vulnerability was also present when using the `CanvasPattern` for a text stroke.
This vulnerability was addressed by implementing `CanvasUtils::DoDrawImageSecurityCheck` when setting a fill style with a canvas pattern and was fixed in Firefox 67 and ESR 60.7.
