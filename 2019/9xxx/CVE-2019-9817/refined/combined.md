critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Bogdan Tara, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jan Varga, Gary Kwong, Tim Guan-tin Chien, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, and Ted Campbell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 66, Firefox ESR 60.6, and Thunderbird 60.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

While fuzzing Spidermonkey, I encountered the following (commented and modified) JavaScript program which crashes debug builds of the latest release version of Spidermonkey (from commit [3ecf89da497cf1abe2a89d1b3c282b48e5dfac8c](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/3ecf89da497cf1abe2a89d1b3c282b48e5dfac8c)):

```
function O1() {
    this.s = 'foobar';
    this.a = 42;

    // Avoid unboxed layout for O1 instances as this will cause the JIT
    // compiler to behave differently and not emit the ObjectGroupDispatch
    // operation (see below).
    delete this.a;
}

// This function will be inlined below in v4, together with the default
// Object.prototype.toString implementation.
// This just demonstrates that a custom function can be inlined which
// will make assumptions about the input ObjectGroup.
O1.prototype.toString = function() {
    return this.s;
};

function v4(v5) {
    // Once v22 is allocated as unboxed object, this will convert it to a
    // native object, which will cause its ObjectGroup to change.
    delete v5.nonExistent;

    // The call to .toString here will be implemented as a switch
    // (ObjectGroupDispatch operation) on the ObjectGroup with two cases
    // (ObjectGroup of v22 and v17). Depending on the input, the dispatch will
    // jump to one of the two inlined implementations of toString. However,
    // after v22 is allocated as UnboxedObject (still with the same
    // ObjectGroup as before), the delete operation above will convert it back
    // to a NativeObject, now changing the ObjectGroup. Afterwards, this
    // ObjectGroupDispatch operation will see an unexpected ObjectGroup and,
    // in debug builds, crash with an assertion failure. In release builds
    // it will just fallthrough to whichever branch was emitted right after
    // the dispatch operation.
    return v5.toString();
}

function v11() {
    const v22 = {p: 1337};
    v4(v22);

    let v26 = 0;
    do {
        const v17 = new O1;
        v4(v17);
        v26++;
    } while (v26 < 100);
}
for (let v33 = 0; v33 < 100; v33++) {
    const v37 = v11();
}

```

The program will crash with an assertion similar to:

```
> ../build_DBG.OBJ/dist/bin/js crash.js
Assertion failure: Unexpected ObjectGroup, at js/src/jit/MacroAssembler.cpp:2014
[1]    54116 trace trap  ../build_DBG.OBJ/dist/bin/js crash.js

```

It appears that roughly the following is happening here:

* Initially, the objects v22 and v17 will be allocated as native objects with two different ObjectGroups (an ObjectGroup [1] stores type information such as the prototype object and property/method types for an object): OG1 and OG2.
* Function v4 will be called repeatedly with objects of both ObjectGroups and will eventually be JIT compiled by IonMonkey. At that point, it will be compiled to expect an object with ObjectGroup OG1 or OG2 based on type feedback from the interpreter/baseline JIT and will be deoptimized if it is ever called with an object of a different group.
* The call to .toString in v4 will be optimized by inlining [2] the two possible implementations (O1.prototype.toString and Object.prototype.toString) and then performing a switch on the ObjectGroup of the input to determine which implementation to jump to. The switch is implemented by the ObjectGroupDispatch operation. Since both input ObjectGroups are covered, the instruction does not have a default (fallback) path [3].
* At a later point, the allocation site of v22 is modified to create an object with unboxed layout [4] which will store its properties inline in an unboxed form but still use ObjectGroup OG1.
* Afterwards, in the JIT code for v4, the delete operation converts the UnboxedObject back to a NativeObject [5], this time changing the ObjectGroup to a new group OG3 [6].
* Finally, when executing the machine code for the ObjectGroupDispatch operation, the new ObjectGroup matches none of the expected ones. At this point the program will crash with an assertion in debug builds. In release builds, it would now simply fall through to whichever one of the inlined implementations was directly following the ObjectGroupDispatch operation.

At least this way of triggering the bug is related to UnboxedObjects, which [have recently been disabled by default](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commit/26965039e60a00b3600ce2e6a559106e4a3a30ca). However, I am not sure if the conversion from unboxed to native objects due to the property deletion is the only reason that an object's ObjectGroup can change unexpectedly (in this situation).

As for exploitation, it might be possible to cause a type confusion by causing a fallthrough to the inlined code for the other ObjectGroup. In that case, the inlined code would expect to receive an object of a specific ObjectGroup and might omit further security checks based on that. For this specific sample it seems that the fallthrough path always happens to be the correct one (i.e. the one for Object.prototype.toString), but I assume it could also be the other way around in a different context. Furthermore, it might be possible to cause other code constructs (apart form the ObjectGroupDispatch) that rely on ObjectGroup information to misbehave in this situation.

Please note: this bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapse or a patch has been made broadly available (whichever is earlier), the bug report will become visible to the public.

With any fix, please give credit for identifying the vulnerability to Samuel GroÃŸ of Google Project Zero.

Thanks for the report. We have to check if there's a way to trigger this without unboxed objects. Maybe `__proto__` mutation.

Regardless, ObjectGroupDispatch is complicated enough that we should probably have it crash in release builds too when it sees an unexpected group.

Matthew, you might have the fresh-est knowledge about this part of the code. Mind to have a look and forwarding to the right person or taking it?

Ok, I'll spend today looking at this. At the bare minimum I'll produce a patch to crash on an unexpected group in `ObjectGroupDispatch`.

## Investigation into other group change mechanisms

*tldr;* I can't prove this is unexploitable outside of UnboxedObjects, due to my unfamiliarity with edge cases of group changes. It seems generally to be an excellent idea to assert in ObjectGroupDispatch. However, I was unable to generate an exploitable test case from attempting to trigger group changes through other mechanisms.

In order for this to be exploitable outside UnboxedObjects we would need to find a way to change the group of an object in such a way that we don't trigger bailout or invalidation, as was the case of the UnboxedLayout bug described in this bug.

First, let's look at [the callers of `setGroup()`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=symbol:_ZN8JSObject8setGroupEPN2js11ObjectGroupE&redirect=false). These callers can be divided into roughly three categories:

1. *Allocation*: These calls to setGroup apply only to newly created objects; *e.g.* `js::MapIteratorObject::createResultPair`, `js::NewArrayOperationWithTemplate`.
2. *Partially Initialized -> Fully initialized*: This would be the transition that occurs in [`UpdateShapeTypeAndValue`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/ddd1679c0534f7ddf36cafddd17b710c4fefe3c4/js/src/vm/NativeObject.cpp#1202). This happens when an objects transitions into its final 'initialized' shape, and the group is changed from a partially-initalized group to a final group.

   I was unable to determine how the boundaries of the "new script" range are determined, so I was unable to experiment with these group transitions.
3. *Singleton-ification*: `JSObject::setSingleton` and `JSObject::changeToSingleton` modify the group. This seems relatively controlled.
4. *Prototype Modification*: or `SetProto`.

The most promising in terms of exploitability seems to be prototype mutation. However, in my experiments, I was unable to trigger a situation where prototype mutation did not in turn invalidate or bailout from Ion.

### Caveats:

There are aspects I haven't investigated that might be cause for concern: While I think that this is *most likely* to be exploitable by trying to change the group of an object in an Ion frame without triggering bailout, it is possible that there are other ways that type barriers can be missed leading to an `ObjectGroupDispatch`. I didn't really investigate them.

### Final Comment

This was not a comprehensive audit: I don't feel like I am qualified to give an overarching recommendation about potential exploitability of this bug, as it sits at the corner of a number of things I have a weak knowledge of: Type Barriers, group mutation, and Ion's guard invariants.

Jan requested I also check the completeness of FunctionDispatch; see above patch.

This change has the potential to cause crashes where we formerly wouldn't have: I'm not sure if we want to subject this patch to some fuzzing before we land it?

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Bogdan Tara, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jan Varga, Gary Kwong, Tim Guan-tin Chien, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, and Ted Campbell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 66 and Firefox ESR 60.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.121 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Navigate to <https://cyberjutsu.io/files/cross_origin_fillText.html>
2. You can see the Google logo has been stolen, then print it out as the textarea value

Tested on latest Stable && Nightly (Windows 10)

Actual results:

At <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/canvas/CanvasRenderingContext2D.cpp?redirect_type=single#3527>

```

      if (state->gradientStyles[style]) {  // Gradient
        pattern = GetGradientFor(style);
      } else if (state->patternStyles[style]) {  // Pattern
        pattern = GetPatternFor(style);
      } else {
        MOZ_ASSERT(false, "Should never reach here.");
        return;
      }
      MOZ_ASSERT(pattern, "No valid pattern.");

      if (style == Style::FILL) {
        params.context->SetPattern(pattern);
      } else {
        params.textStrokePattern = pattern;
      }

```

it's possible to draw a canvaspattern (which can be loaded with an image) as background of a text.

Due to lacking of checking mWriteonly/Principal/CORs later on, we can extract the whole canvas by calling .toDataURL() for example.

```
    ctx.font = "10000px Arial"; // <-- make the dot "." to big, to leak the whole image. we can fix it dynamically depends on image's size.
    ctx.fillStyle = pattern;
    ctx.fillText(".", 0, 200);

```

Expected results:

canvas.toDataURL() should not be invoked successfully due to invalid CORs.

The patch should be trivial.

We can call |CanvasUtils::DoDrawImageSecurityCheck| once the fillstyle is a canvaspattern.

For example:

This is a 'known' issue. We have web-platform tests, (disabled of course) here:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/testing/web-platform/meta/html/semantics/embedded-content/the-canvas-element>

I have a patch to fix them all. Would be really great if somebody can help me checking if we have covered all the possible scenarios. We don't have enough tests and the few we have, if WPT, are disabled.

Hi folks,

I don't think those tests are covering my case.

Since the bug is placed in |Canvas2D::fillText| method

which invoking the actual vulnerable function |DrawText|

( <https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3ebf6f2a81387d7087ef235c3ce60452baf550f3/dom/canvas/CanvasRenderingContext2D.cpp#3527,3580,3588,3590,3616> )

The bug exists in this function only. Other places (which the test-cases already reach) are not vulnerable to this.

To confirm,

<https://github.com/servo/servo/search?q=path%3Atests%2Fwpt%2Fweb-platform-tests%2Fhtml%2Fsemantics%2Fembedded-content%2Fthe-canvas-element%2F+fillText&unscoped_q=path%3Atests%2Fwpt%2Fweb-platform-tests%2Fhtml%2Fsemantics%2Fembedded-content%2Fthe-canvas-element%2F+filltext>

No match found.

It means the test-cases won't recognize this vulnerability.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Impossible. Here we are exposing images which should be protected by cross-origin.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**:
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Easy. I hope.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: There are good tests. I think this patch should not introduce regressions.

Looks like this was successfully landed on the 16th but never got resolved :

<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3fd42eb67a3f>

Andrea, please request Beta/ESR60 approval on this when you get a chance. It grafts cleanly to Beta as-landed but needs a rebased patch for ESR60.

No. There are several problems with requiring/expecting that:

* I (and others on my team) who are responsible for maintining the sync with upstream don't have the correct expertise or appropriate resources to identify which wpt failures may represent security issues. Even in "obvious" cases (like if the test is evidently intended to check SOP correctness) there are many reasons for failure other than a security issue.
* Most tests aren't disabled if they fail. Typically disabling is only used in cases where the test is too unstable to run in CI. In the case that the test is marked as expected:FAIL there is generally no review whatsoever, and these are just as likely to represent security issues as other tests.

The way that we need to deal with this is for platform teams to actively monitor the wpt tests that fail (or otherwise aren't passing) in their components. <https://jgraham.github.io/wptdash> is intended to help with this, and the intent is that we will be able to add annotations to the test results linking them with bugs, so teams are able to triage the Firefox failures (or at least the Firefox-only failures) and so keep the number of untriaged issues to zero, just like we do for incoming bug reports. As a side effect that should allow us to identify potential security issues faster.

So I fully agree that we should be more actively looking at the results of these tests, not only for security bugs, and there are efforts ongoing to make that more workable for platform teams.

Hi, I tried reproducing this issue but the Steps were a bit confusing, and the Results even more so.

In an older version of Firefox I can see 2 images plus the Text for the Leaked image.

In newer versions of Firefox, where the fix is supposed to be I only see 1 Google logo and no text in the Leaked section.

However on Chrome I do not see any images or text in the leak section.

What are the correct Expected Results ? can someone help us out with that ?

Chrome implementation seems to be broken. The spec says that we should not expose the content, but it can still be shown.

So the expected results should be to display 1 Google image but no code in the leak section right ??

4.12.5.6 Security with canvas elements

<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#security-with-canvas-elements>

"Information leakage can occur if scripts from one origin can access information (e.g. read pixels) from images from another origin (one that isn't the same).

To mitigate this, bitmaps used with canvas elements and ImageBitmap objects are defined to have a flag indicating whether they are origin-clean. All bitmaps start with their origin-clean set to true. The flag is set to false when cross-origin images are used.

The toDataURL(), toBlob(), and getImageData() methods check the flag and will throw a "SecurityError" DOMException rather than leak cross-origin data."

This has nothing to do with the displaying of the canvas content.

This test is covered by several tests and it has not introduced any regressions in nightly.

The code is relatively easy, so yes, I think it's OK to uplift it.

The changes fail to apply on ESR60, conflicts with at least [bug 1500768](/show_bug.cgi?id=1500768 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement SVG image support for createImageBitmap"). Please provide patches for ESR.

I don't think we need to uplift to esr60 because there, we don't have clean-origin at all. Fixing this would require the uplift [bug 1502799](/show_bug.cgi?id=1502799 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement origin-clean algorithm for ImageBitmap") too.

Dan, do you have an opinion here? We've fixed this for 67 but the work seems a bit complex for esr uplift. Do you think it is OK here to wait for esr68 or should we go for an uplift here and in the 3 bugs mentioned in [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=1540221#c29 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: Cross-origin theft of images in fillText and CanvasPattern")?

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

The two regressions in [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=1540221#c29 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: Cross-origin theft of images in fillText and CanvasPattern") are small/safe-looking patches, and this patch isn't too bad, so the question is how risky is the patch in [bug 1502799](/show_bug.cgi?id=1502799 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement origin-clean algorithm for ImageBitmap") to back-port? It's longish but looks pretty straightforward (a lot of passing a new argument around).

Given how easy this attack is to pull off once the bug is known I don't see how we could skip fixing a sec-high bug on ESR-60.

baku, given [comment 32](/show_bug.cgi?id=1540221#c32 "VERIFIED FIXED - Security: Cross-origin theft of images in fillText and CanvasPattern"), could you put together patches and request uplift for esr60 on whatever would be needed?

Liz, do you want 1 single big patch or you are OK with them to be separate? I can rebase them in case they don't apply to esr60.

#### [#CVE-2019-9815: Disable hyperthreading on content JavaScript threads on macOS](#CVE-2019-9815)

Reporter
[Multiple independent researchers](https://mdsattacks.com/#People)
Impact
high
##### Description

If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads.
*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*
