*  **Impact:** Program crash due to a segmentation fault when trying to access invalid memory.
*   **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious MAT file with specific structures and fields.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MAT file.

**7. Out-of-bounds write in `Mat_VarFree` (src/mat.c:1473)**

*   **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds write within `Mat_VarFree` during the freeing of variable data due to an invalid pointer.
*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write.
*   **Impact:** Program crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious MAT file with specific structures and fields.
*    **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MAT file.

**8. Stack-buffer-overflow in `ReadNextCell` (src/mat5.c:1293)**

*   **Root cause:**  A stack buffer overflow in the `ReadNextCell` function. The `memcpy` operation overflows the `uncomp_buf` buffer.
*   **Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:**  Program crash due to memory corruption in the stack.
*   **Attack vector:** By crafting a malicious MAT file triggering the vulnerable code in `ReadNextCell`.
