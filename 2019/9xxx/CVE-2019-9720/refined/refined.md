{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `srt_to_ass` function in `srtdec.c` does not properly handle nested tags in SRT subtitles, leading to a stack overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of nested tags",
      "Lack of sufficient stack space for complex tag structures"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted SRT subtitle file could cause a stack overflow during decoding, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious SRT subtitle files",
       "Use of a media player or software library that uses the vulnerable srtdec.c to decode SRT subtitles"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted SRT subtitle to the victim's software."
    ],
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability arises in the `srt_to_ass` function, which parses SRT tags and converts them to ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha) format. The function uses a stack-based structure to keep track of open tags. If an SRT file contains a deeply nested sequence of tags, the stack can overflow, causing a crash or potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite stack data. The fix involves more robust parsing and stack management to prevent stack overflow."
