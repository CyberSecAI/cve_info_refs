Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9845:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `SaveFilesToDisk` method in the `BlogController.cs` file, which processes image data embedded in blog posts. This method extracts base64-encoded data from `img` tags, saves the decoded data as a file on the server, and updates the `img` tag to point to the newly saved file.  The method lacks proper validation of the file extension, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary file types.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of File Extension Validation:** The code extracts the file extension from the MIME type (or from the data-filename attribute in the core version) of the base64-encoded data. It does not validate that this extension is a safe file type, such as an image. This allows an attacker to specify a malicious extension like `.aspx`.
*  **Direct File Saving:** The decoded base64 data is directly written to disk without sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to upload executable code or other malicious files.
*   **No Content-Type Validation**: The code doesn't check if the file content matches the declared MIME type. This allows for arbitrary file content to be saved as an ASPX file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server by creating an ASPX file (or other executable files) through a crafted data URL in an `img` tag. This allows the attacker to take complete control of the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full compromise of the server, enabling attackers to steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Data URLs:** The attacker injects a crafted `img` tag with a data URL containing a base64-encoded payload. The MIME type (or data-filename attribute) of the data URL is set to indicate an executable file type such as ASPX.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the MiniBlog application, specifically through the blog post creation or editing functionality that allows users to include images.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User with Post Creation/Editing Privileges:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient permissions to create or edit blog posts. The `[Authorize]` attribute on the `UpdatePost` action requires the user to be logged in.
*   **Access to the Blog Interface:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the MiniBlog application.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know how to craft the malicious data URL to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit for the original MiniBlog version (CVE-2019-9842), which used MIME type to derive the file extension. The vulnerability also exists in the MiniBlog.Core project (CVE-2019-9845), but with the additional possibility to specify filename via the `data-filename` attribute.
*   The blog post details how the `SaveFilesToDisk` function parses the HTML of the post and extracts base64 encoded data from img tags
*   The blog post and the POC exploit specifically use an ASPX payload, but other filetypes could be used depending on the server configuration.
*   The `AutoValidateAntiforgeryToken` attribute on `UpdatePost` prevents CSRF, it does not affect the RCE vulnerability itself.
*   The `SaveFilesToDisk` method in the provided `BlogController.cs` code snippet does not fully match the code in the blog post, it has been modified slightly to use data-filename attribute instead of relying on the MIME type.
