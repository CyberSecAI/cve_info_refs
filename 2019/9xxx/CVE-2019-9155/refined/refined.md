Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-9155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange implementation in OpenPGP.js did not validate that the public key of the communication partner was valid, meaning it didn't verify that the point lied on the expected elliptic curve.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Invalid Curve Attack:** The lack of validation allowed an attacker to manipulate the public key, effectively causing the application to calculate the shared secret based on a different, attacker-controlled curve, rather than the intended one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Private Key Extraction:** By carefully crafting multiple manipulated messages with altered curves and observing whether decryption fails, an attacker could extract the victim's private key. The attacker can use different altered curves and public keys to derive remainders of the private key.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated Messages:** The attacker needs to provide manipulated messages to the victim.
- **Observation of Decryption Failures:** The attacker needs to observe if decryption fails or not to extract information about the private key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send messages:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted, manipulated messages to the victim.
- **Ability to observe decryption:** The attacker needs a way to know if decryption fails in response to the crafted messages.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in OpenPGP.js versions <= 4.2.0 and was fixed in version 4.3.0.
- The attack exploits the fact that OpenPGP uses only the x-coordinate of the secret point.
- The provided information includes a Proof of Concept script (`invalid_curve_attack.js`) that demonstrates the vulnerability and shows that the remainders of the private key matches the corresponding gathered remainders.
