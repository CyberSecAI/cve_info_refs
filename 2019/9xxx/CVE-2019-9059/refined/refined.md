Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9059:

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that CMS Made Simple version 2.2.10 addresses multiple security vulnerabilities. The most critical vulnerability is an SQL injection vulnerability in the default action.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the "default action."
    *   There is also a minor object insertion vulnerability within the ModuleManager and some minor authenticated vulnerabilities in the core and FilePicker module.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   SQL Injection
    *   Object Insertion vulnerability
    *   Authenticated security vulnerabilities
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The SQL injection vulnerability is described as "critical" implying a high potential impact such as data theft, data manipulation or full compromise of the system.
    *  Other vulnerabilities may allow for unauthorized access to sensitive information, unauthorized modification of data, and potentially lead to further compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The SQL injection is present in the default action of an unknown component, suggesting that it could be triggered by a variety of attack vectors.
    *   The object insertion vulnerability is in the ModuleManager, which implies an attack vector through module management functionality.
    *   The authenticated vulnerabilities in core and FilePicker module would require an authenticated user to be exploited.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The SQL injection could potentially be exploited remotely if the default action is accessible without authentication.
    *   The ModuleManager object insertion would likely require some level of administrative access or control over the upload mechanism.
    *   The authenticated vulnerabilities would require a valid user account.
