{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `malloc` function in the S5L8920 bootrom does not return `NULL` when it fails to allocate memory. Instead, it returns a pointer to memory address `0x8` which leads to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect implementation of the `malloc` function",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to the returned pointer `0x8` being used as a valid pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to corruption of the exception vector table and execution of attacker-controlled shellcode.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Heap exhaustion through multiple IMG3 image parsing.",
      "Overwriting exception vector table by overflowing heap and writing controlled data at address `0x8`.",
      "Triggering data abort exception via use-after-free by calling free on address `0x8` to execute the attacker controlled shellcode."
    ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to flash modified NOR image containing multiple IMG3 images to cause heap exhaustion and inject shellcode and then, triggering the bug"
