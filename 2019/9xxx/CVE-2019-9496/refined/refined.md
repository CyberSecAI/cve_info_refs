Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-9496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in missing state validation within the hostapd implementation when processing SAE confirm messages. Specifically, during the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) handshake, the hostapd process does not properly check the state of the handshake before processing a confirm message, leading to a potential NULL pointer dereference and process termination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing State Validation:** Hostapd lacks sufficient validation of the handshake state during SAE confirm message processing. This means that it can try to access memory before it should.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The lack of state validation can lead to a NULL pointer dereference within hostapd. This dereference leads to a crash of the process, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack will force the hostapd process to terminate unexpectedly.  This would disrupt the Wi-Fi access point functionality, thus denying service to connected clients.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Network:**  The attack is executed over a wireless network, by sending malicious SAE confirm messages to a vulnerable hostapd access point. This requires the attacker to be in radio range of the target access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Radio Proximity:** The attacker must be within radio range of the targeted access point to transmit malicious packets.
*   **Wireless Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft valid (yet malicious) SAE confirm messages. The attack requires specific understanding of the SAE handshake.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the network.

**Additional Notes from Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of hostapd with SAE support up to and including version 2.7.
*   This issue is related to other SAE vulnerabilities (e.g. cache-based attacks CVE-2019-9494)
*   The fixes address issues both in the server and peer/client components of SAE.
*   The issue does not affect wpa_supplicant in station mode, only when used as a wireless access point
*   Some sources rate this vulnerability as moderate, while other list it as low severity.
*   The attack can be performed by an attacker in radio range of a vulnerable access point, and will cause the hostapd process to terminate (Denial-of-Service)
