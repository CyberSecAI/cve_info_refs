Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9855:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content from `bugzilla.suse.com` clearly indicates that CVE-2019-9855 is relevant. The bug report specifically mentions "CVE-2019-9855: libreoffice: Windows 8.3 path equivalence handling flaw allows LibreLogo script execution".

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in LibreOffice's handling of Windows 8.3 path equivalencies (short file names).
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   LibreOffice's script execution mechanism allows documents to trigger pre-installed scripts (like LibreLogo) using script event handlers (e.g., mouse-over).
    *   While there was an attempt to block calling LibreLogo from script event handlers, the Windows 8.3 path equivalence flaw allowed bypassing this protection. This means that a specially crafted document could use a Windows short file name (8.3 filename pseudonym) to trigger the execution of LibreLogo.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows arbitrary Python code execution from a malicious LibreOffice document.
    *   This could lead to a wide range of attacks, such as data theft, malware installation, and system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   A specially crafted LibreOffice document (e.g., .odt, .odp, etc) is the attack vector.
    *   The attack is specific to Windows platforms due to the 8.3 path handling flaw.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a malicious LibreOffice document.
    *   The attacker must get the user to open the crafted document.

**3. Additional Information from the Content**

*   The vulnerability affects LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.7 and 6.3.1.
*   The bug report from SUSE indicates that this vulnerability has a **Critical severity** as per the NVD CVSS v3 score and has a **Moderate severity** as per SUSE.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Windows, because of Windows 8.3 path equivalence handling.
*   SUSE has released security advisories to address this issue: SUSE-SU-2019:2401-1, SUSE-SU-2019:2402-1, SUSE-SU-2019:2686-1, openSUSE-SU-2019:2183-1, openSUSE-SU-2019:2361-1
*   The LibreOffice advisory confirms a fix in 6.2.7 and 6.3.1.

**4. Resolution**

The vulnerability was addressed by rejecting such paths in the affected software. Specifically, the fix prevents LibreOffice from being able to use Windows 8.3 aliases of file paths in order to trigger the execution of LibreLogo from a document.
