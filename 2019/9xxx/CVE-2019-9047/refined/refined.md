```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it allows user-controlled input in the `order_by` and `group_by` parameters of SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection. The `order_by` and `group_by` clauses in SQL queries are constructed using user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious SQL code into the `order_by` or `group_by` parameters, for instance via a GET request. The provided example in the document shows how to use `extractvalue` and `group_concat` within the injection to exfiltrate database information.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests with malicious SQL code in the `order_by` or `group_by` parameters to the affected application, often via HTTP parameters."
