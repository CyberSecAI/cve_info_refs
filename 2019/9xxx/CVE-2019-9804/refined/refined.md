Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9804:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2019-9804**. The description within the Mozilla Security Advisory 2019-07 document, coupled with the associated bug report from Bugzilla (bug 1518026), confirms this.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:

*   **Firefox Developer Tools "Copy as cURL" Feature:** The "Copy as cURL" functionality within Firefox's Developer Tools generates a cURL command from a network request.
*   **Inadequate escaping of special characters:** When generating the cURL command, the code did not properly escape characters that have special meaning in a POSIX shell (like bash), specifically `!`.
*   **Bash history expansion issue on macOS:** Older versions of bash on macOS have a vulnerability related to history expansion. When a string containing `!` is processed through the `$''` construct, a crafted input may lead to unintended command execution.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection in the shell where crafted URL or data via copy as curl, if pasted to a terminal, will lead to unintended code execution
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The "Copy as cURL" feature failed to sanitize special characters in the URL and POST data before including them in the generated cURL command.
*   **Reliance on potentially vulnerable bash:** The vulnerability is exposed by the interaction with a specific bash vulnerability.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker could craft a malicious URL or POST data that, when copied as cURL and pasted into a terminal, would execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This was due to bash history expansion vulnerability
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability can lead to the attacker gaining the privileges of the user pasting the command into their shell.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could host a malicious web page that sends a request with a crafted URL or post body. A developer using Firefox DevTools to inspect network traffic could copy the cURL command to be exploited.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker performing a MitM attack could modify HTTP responses to include malicious URLs or POST data, which when "copied as cURL", may lead to a local code execution.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Malicious content creation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious requests (URLs, POST data) with special characters.
*   **Social engineering (to some degree):** The attacker would need a user (developer) to copy the generated cURL command from Firefox's DevTools and paste it into a terminal to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **macOS Environment:** Exploitation is limited to systems where the user is running macOS using a vulnerable version of bash.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by `potatoe`
*   The fix involved escaping the `!` character using `\041`.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 66 and was not uplifted to ESR 60, because the issue was limited to developer tools on macOS.
*   A similar issue was found and fixed in Chrome devtools.

In summary, CVE-2019-9804 allowed a remote attacker to execute code on a developer's system by exploiting a flaw in how Firefox generates cURL commands and how macOS bash handles history expansion.
