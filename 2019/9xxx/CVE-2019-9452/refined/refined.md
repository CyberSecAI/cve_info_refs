```
{
  "CVE-2019-9452": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `sec_ts` touch driver's sysfs store callback was not properly validating the length of user-supplied data being copied into kernel buffers, leading to potential out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially overwrite kernel memory by providing a command with a length exceeding the buffer allocated for it, leading to a system crash or potentially arbitrary code execution in the kernel.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with access to the device's sysfs interface (typically through a compromised application or ADB) could write a crafted string to the `sec_cmd` sysfs node, triggering the vulnerable code path.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires a position to write to the device's sysfs interface."
  }
