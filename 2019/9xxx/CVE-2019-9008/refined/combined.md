CVE: CVE-2019-9008 [6]

ICS-CERT: ICSA-19-255-03 [8]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-65847, CDS-58163

2.4  Severity Rating

3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH has rated this vulnerability as high.

The CVSS v3.0 base score of 8.8 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is
(CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). [7]

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Runtime System enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable industrial
controller. For the communication with the CODESYS Development System or other clients, the implemented
CODESYS protocol provides also access to directories, files, applications, symbols and so on. The online user
management of the runtime system CODESYS Control controls access to all these objects. Sub objects such as
a subdirectory inherit the access rights from the superordinate objects, if they have not been assigned their own
access rights. The online user management may incorrectly grant access to such sub objects, even if the
logged-in user does not have inherited permission to access them.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
