Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an **incorrect permission assignment** within the online user management of the CODESYS runtime system. Specifically, sub-objects (like subdirectories) do not correctly inherit access rights from their parent objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Inheritance of Permissions:** The system fails to properly enforce inherited access rights for sub-objects.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:** Logged-in users can gain access to sub-objects even if they lack the necessary inherited permissions.
*   **CWE-732:** This vulnerability is categorized as "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource" (CWE-732).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to functionalities and information they should not have.
*   **Potential for Data Breach:** Sensitive data stored within sub-objects may be exposed.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation could lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system
*  The CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 reflects the high potential impact of this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, indicating network-based attack vectors.
*   **Network Access Required:** Attackers would need network access to the CODESYS runtime system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with low skill level, suggesting ease of exploitation.
*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account to login to the CODESYS Runtime System.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** All CODESYS Control V3 runtime systems prior to version V3.5.13.0 that include the CmpUserMgr component are vulnerable.
*  **Mitigation:** Update to CODESYS version 3.5.13.0 or later.
*   **No Known Public Exploits:** While no public exploits are known, this doesn't negate the risk.
*   **Vendor Recommendation:** The vendor recommends using firewalls, VPNs, and other defensive measures to protect control systems.
