- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NetBackup Appliance Web Console displays the SMTP password in plaintext to administrators if an SMTP password has been previously configured, even if SMTP is not currently active.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (SMTP password)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An administrator can retrieve the SMTP password, which can then be used to access the SMTP server for other purposes, potentially disrupting email services by changing the password.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the NetBackup Appliance Web Console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a privileged administrator with access to the NetBackup Appliance Web Console.
