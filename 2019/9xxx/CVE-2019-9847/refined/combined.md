**LibreOffice is a privacy-oriented office suite that runs on your own computer and doesn’t include AI features out-of-the-box. But we know that many users are interested in combining AI tools with the suite, so we talked to John Balis who is working on a (fully optional!) LibreOffice extension called [localwriter](https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter). Here’s what he had to say…**

**Dione Maddern** and The Documentation Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of the **LibreOffice Calc Guide 24.8**, an update of the existing Calc Guide 24.2 with enhancements taken from the current LibreOffice 24.8 Calc module.

[![Calc Guide 24.8](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CoverCalc248-724x1024.png)](http://books.libreoffice.org)

The book was reviewed for clarity, readability and content additions, notably the **Calc database table referencing in formulas**, removal of deprecated JavaScript debugger and refactoring of the Calc’s chart topic – in which the chapter on charts was split in two, one for the chart basics and the second for the chart types.…

**Marcial Machado recently [posted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libreoffice/comments/1hf4sqo/i_made_an_impress_template_in_native_opt_to_play/) about his “fully-featured LibreOffice Impress template for creating Jeopardy-style games. Just add your questions and categories, and you’re good to go!” So let’s find out more…**

### What does the template do?

At its core, the template is meant to emulate what a game of Jeopardy is like. You can click on any of the squares on the game board and it will send you to the slide with the associated question, where you can either return to the board in the case of a misclick, or reveal the answer to the question.…

### CVE-2019-9847

**Title:** CVE-2019-9847 Executable hyperlink targets executed unconditionally on activation

**Announced:** May 8, 2019

**Fixed in:** 6.1.6/6.2.3

**Description**:

Before 6.1.6/6.2.3 under Windows and macOS when processing a hyperlink target explicitly activated by the user there was no judgment made on whether the target was an executable file, so such executable targets were launched unconditionally.

In the fixed versions, such executables are not executed on hyperlink activation.

**Credits**:

Thanks to Zhongcheng Li(CK01) of Pox Security Team for reporting this issue

**References**:

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinnÃ¼tzige rechtsfÃ¤hige Stiftung des bÃ¼rgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world’s leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.
