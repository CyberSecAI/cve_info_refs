Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of checks on hyperlink targets in LibreOffice before versions 6.1.6 and 6.2.3. Specifically, when a user clicked on a hyperlink, the software would unconditionally execute the target file if it was an executable, without any security verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unconditional execution of hyperlink targets: The primary weakness was that LibreOffice did not differentiate between safe and potentially malicious targets.
- Lack of validation on file types: There was no check to determine whether the hyperlink target was an executable file before executing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By crafting a document with a hyperlink pointing to a malicious executable file, an attacker could trick a user into executing arbitrary code on their machine.
- Complete system compromise: If the executed file was malware, it could potentially take complete control of the user's system, leading to data theft, system damage, or further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted documents: The attack vector involves creating documents that contain specially crafted hyperlinks.
- Social engineering: Attackers would rely on social engineering tactics to convince users to open the document and click on the malicious hyperlink.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify documents: The attacker would need to create a document with a malicious hyperlink.
- Social engineering skills: Attackers need to trick users into opening malicious documents and clicking on the hyperlinks.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affected Windows and macOS platforms.
- The fix involved preventing the execution of executable files when a user clicked on a hyperlink.
- The vulnerability was reported by Zhongcheng Li(CK01) of Pox Security Team.
- The affected versions of LibreOffice were prior to 6.1.6 and 6.2.3.
