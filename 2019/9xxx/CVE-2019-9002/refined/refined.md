{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `install/config-setup.php` file where user-supplied input from the `database_host` POST parameter is directly injected into the `$config_file` variable using `str_replace`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized user input",
      "Direct code injection"
    ],
    "impact": "The attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to a full compromise of the system (getshel). In the provided PoC, `phpinfo()` is executed, but any malicious code could be injected.",
     "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to `/install/config-setup.php` with a malicious payload in the `database_host` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."
  }
