Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the J2Store component for Joomla!.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `product_option[j]` array parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL queries: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to:
    - Data breaches: Access to sensitive information stored in the database.
    - Data modification: Alteration or deletion of data.
    - Privilege escalation: In some cases, gaining administrative access to the database or system.
    - Denial of service: Through malicious queries, overloading the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP request: The vulnerability can be exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to a Joomla! website using the vulnerable J2Store component.
- Vulnerable parameter: The `product_option[j]` array parameter is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No specific user interaction is needed for the exploitation to happen.

**Additional details:**
- Affected versions: J2Store versions prior to 3.3.7 are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to "run arbitrary queries on the website."
- The provided exploit example uses SQL injection payloads within the `product_option[j]` parameter to demonstrate the vulnerability and exfiltrate data.
