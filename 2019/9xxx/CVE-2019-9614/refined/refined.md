Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of the Freemarker templating engine within the OFCMS backend. Freemarker allows the instantiation of arbitrary Java objects through its `TemplateModel` interface. Specifically, the `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` class can be used to execute arbitrary system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insecure Templating:** The core issue is the use of a templating engine (Freemarker) in a way that allows for the instantiation of dangerous classes, specifically `freemarker.template.utility.Execute`.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application doesn't properly sanitize or restrict the content that can be placed in template files, allowing an attacker to inject Freemarker code that executes system commands.
- **Unrestricted Object Instantiation**: The Freemarker template engine, by design, allows for object creation which can be a security risk if the application doesn't control or restrict which objects can be created, especially when user-controlled data is used in the template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the OFCMS application. This can lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access and theft of sensitive data.
    - **System Compromise:** Full control over the server.
    - **Malware Installation:**  Installation of malicious software.
    - **Denial of Service:** Disrupting the server's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Template Modification:** The attacker exploits the ability to modify template files via the OFCMS backend.
- **Freemarker Injection:** The attacker injects malicious Freemarker code within the template file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to OFCMS Backend:** The attacker needs to have legitimate access to the OFCMS backend where template files can be modified. This implies that the attacker needs to have valid credentials or has found a way to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content shows a proof-of-concept exploit using the following code injected into a template file:

```
<#assign ex="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()> ${ ex("whoami") }
```

This code snippet:
1.  Uses the Freemarker template syntax to create a new variable `ex`
2.  Assigns to `ex` an instance of the `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` class.
3.  Executes the system command `whoami` using the `ex` variable.

The vulnerability is present in OFCMS versions prior to 1.1.3.
