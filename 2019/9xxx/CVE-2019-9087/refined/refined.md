Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the HotelDruid application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `numtariffa1` parameter in the `/tab_tariffe.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could lead to:
    - **Data Breach:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data like customer information, booking details, pricing, etc.
    - **Data Manipulation:** Altering data to cause application malfunctions or financial losses.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Possibly gaining administrative access if the database user has sufficient privileges.
    - **Denial of Service:** Causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/tab_tariffe.php` endpoint.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `numtariffa1` parameter is the entry point for the malicious SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the HotelDruid application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:**  The attacker must know or be able to identify the vulnerable URL `/tab_tariffe.php` and the `numtariffa1` parameter.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided PoC suggests the injection is possible without prior authentication, but this is not explicitly stated.
