- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to sanitize user input provided via the `admin/system_manage/user_config_edit.html` `value` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML that will execute in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker by injecting a malicious payload into the vulnerable parameter. This payload will be stored by the application and executed when a user views the relevant page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative access to the application to be able to modify user configurations via the vulnerable parameter.
