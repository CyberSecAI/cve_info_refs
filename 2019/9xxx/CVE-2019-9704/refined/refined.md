Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9704:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing check on the return value of the `calloc()` function within the cron daemon. `calloc()` is used to allocate memory, and if it fails, it returns a NULL pointer. The cron daemon fails to check for this condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unchecked return value:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check to ensure `calloc()` succeeded in allocating the requested memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** When `calloc()` fails and returns NULL, the program tries to use the NULL pointer, leading to a crash of the cron daemon.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause the cron daemon to crash, disrupting scheduled tasks and potentially impacting system functionality that relies on those tasks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Large crontab file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user creating a very large crontab file. This forces the daemon to try allocating a lot of memory which might fail and cause a crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local user:** A local user who can create or modify crontab files can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory allocation issue that is common in applications that are not correctly handling memory operations.
*   The fix involves adding a check for a NULL return from `calloc()`, ensuring the daemon doesn't try to use unallocated memory and crash.
*   The issue has been addressed in cron versions `3.0pl1-133` and `cronie 1.5.3`, as well as in Debian package `3.0pl1-127+deb8u2` and `3.0pl1-128+deb9u2`.
