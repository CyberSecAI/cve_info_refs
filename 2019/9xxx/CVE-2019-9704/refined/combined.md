Package        : cron
Version        : 3.0pl1-127+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-9525 CVE-2019-9704 CVE-2019-9705 CVE-2019-9706
Debian Bug     : 809167

Various security problems have been discovered in Debian's CRON scheduler.

CVE-2017-9525

    Fix group crontab to root escalation via the Debian package's
    postinst script as described by Alexander Peslyak (Solar Designer) in
    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/08/3>

CVE-2019-9704

    DoS: Fix unchecked return of calloc(). Florian Weimer discovered that
    a missing check for the return value of calloc() could crash the
    daemon, which could be triggered by a very large crontab created by a
    user.

CVE-2019-9705

    Enforce maximum crontab line count of 1000 to prevent a malicious
    user from creating an excessivly large crontab. The daemon will log a
    warning for existing files, and crontab(1) will refuse to create new
    ones.

CVE-2019-9706

    A user reported a use-after-free condition in the cron daemon,
    leading to a possible Denial-of-Service scenario by crashing the
    daemon.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.0pl1-127+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your cron packages.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 30 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC 2.29](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC229 "Changes/GLIBC229")
* [Fully remove deprecated and unsafe functions from libcrypt](/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt "Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt")
* [Boost 1.69](/wiki/Changes/F30Boost169 "Changes/F30Boost169")
* [golang 1.12](/wiki/Changes/golang1.12 "Changes/golang1.12")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Thursday, January 31st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f30
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f30. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f30 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f30
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a gcc build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-01-31 10:10:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f30-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f30 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

Debian Bug     : 809167

Brief introduction

CVE-2017-9525

    Fix group crontab to root escalation via postinst.

CVE-2019-9704

    A very large crontab created by a user could crash the daemon.

CVE-2019-9705

    Enforce maximum crontab line count of 10000 to prevent a malicious
    user from creating an excessivly large crontab.

CVE-2019-9706

    Fix for possible DoS by use-after-free.

Additionally, a bypass of /etc/cron.{allow,deny} on failure to open has
been fixed. If these files exist, then they must be readable by the user
executing crontab(1). Users will now be denied by default if they aren't.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.0pl1-128+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your cron packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

```

Florian Weimer discovered that a missing check for the return value of calloc()
could crash the daemon, which could be triggered by a very large crontab
created by a user.
