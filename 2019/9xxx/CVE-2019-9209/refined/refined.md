  "CVE-2019-9209": {
    "description": "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.12 and 2.6.0 to 2.6.6, the ASN.1 BER and related dissectors could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c by preventing a buffer overflow associated with excessive digits in time values.",
    "affected_versions": "2.4.0 to 2.4.12, 2.6.0 to 2.6.6",
    "fixed_versions": "2.4.13, 2.6.7",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ASN.1 BER and related dissectors due to excessive digits in time values.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based off-by-one buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending specially crafted network traffic or by convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file which will cause a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network injection of malformed packets",
       "Opening of malformed packet trace files"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a malformed packet over the network to the target. An attacker can also convince a user to open a malformed file."
