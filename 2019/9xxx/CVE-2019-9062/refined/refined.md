Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-9062:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the PHP Scripts Mall Online Food Ordering Script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application does not implement proper checks to ensure that requests to modify user profiles are initiated by the user themselves and not by a malicious third party.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions on the web application, such as modifying their profile details (e.g., renaming account). This can be used to deface user accounts, potentially leading to phishing attacks, or cause other unintended consequences within the application depending on how extensive the impact of editing the profile is.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack is initiated by a malicious webpage containing crafted HTML (CSRF PoC) that, when opened by a logged-in user of the vulnerable application, will trigger a state-changing request to the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML file containing the crafted CSRF attack.
*   The attacker must find a way to trick a logged in user into opening the malicious HTML (e.g. via social engineering, a malicious link, compromised site).
*   The user must be logged into the vulnerable web application at the time the malicious HTML is opened in the browser.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content gives detailed steps on how to exploit the CSRF vulnerability, including:
*   Registering on the vulnerable site
*   Capturing a profile update request with an intercepting proxy (Burp Suite)
*   Generating a CSRF Proof of Concept (PoC) HTML file using captured request data
*   Executing the CSRF PoC by getting a logged-in user to visit the generated HTML file to trigger a change of their user profile.
