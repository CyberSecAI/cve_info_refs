Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9628:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents directly reference **CVE-2019-9628** and describe a vulnerability related to the XMLTooling library. The NetApp advisory specifically mentions this CVE and states that "XMLTooling Library versions prior to V3.0.4 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS)." Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   *   **Root Cause:** The root cause is an improper handling of exceptions within the XML parsing class of the XMLTooling library. Specifically, when the parser encounters invalid data within an XML declaration, it throws an exception of a type that is not properly handled, leading to a crash.
   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the XML parsing logic, where unexpected exception types are not caught, leading to a crash/Denial of Service.
   *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition in applications that utilize the vulnerable XMLTooling library. The NetApp advisory specifically notes that "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS)."
   *   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves providing specially crafted XML content containing malformed date/time information in the XML declaration which triggers the unhandled exception.
   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply the malformed XML to an application that uses the vulnerable XMLTooling library. This can be achieved remotely as the vulnerability exists prior to any authenticity checks.

**3. Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

   *   **NetApp's Response:** NetApp identifies the vulnerability as present in XMLTooling Library versions prior to V3.0.4 and provides a list of NetApp products that are *not* affected. They recommend upgrading to V3.0.4 or later of the library. They also state that the updated library was included in the SP V3.0.4 patch release for Windows products.
   *   **NetApp Impacted Products:** The NetApp advisory explicitly states that "None" of their products are affected, but also provides an extensive list of products not affected by this vulnerability.
    *   **Shibboleth SP:** The advisory from shibboleth.net states that the vulnerability is present in Shibboleth Service Provider software versions between 3.0.0 and 3.0.2
   *   **OpenSUSE and Ubuntu:** Both OpenSUSE and Ubuntu have issued security advisories and patches that address this vulnerability in their respective distributions.
   *   **Upstream Fix:** The upstream fix, as identified in the shibboleth.net advisory, is commit af27c422f551e16989ff6f1722d83614c8550eb5 in the cpp-xmltooling git repository.
   *  **CVSS Score Discrepancy**: Note that while the NVD provides a CVSS v3 score of 7.5, NetApp rated the vulnerability with a base score of 5.3.
