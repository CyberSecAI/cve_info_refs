  "CVE-2019-9193": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Content": "Trustwave initially reported this as a vulnerability, but later retracted it, stating it is a misconfiguration issue, not a vulnerability in PostgreSQL software.  NetApp also confirms it's not a vulnerability, marking their advisory as 'None - no longer considered a vulnerability'.",
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
      "More Details": true
    },
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `COPY TO/FROM PROGRAM` feature, introduced in PostgreSQL 9.3, allows a database superuser or a user with the `pg_execute_server_program` role to execute arbitrary operating system commands in the context of the user running the PostgreSQL instance. This is due to the design of the `COPY FROM/TO PROGRAM` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of privilege separation between a database superuser and the operating system user running the database, potentially leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with superuser or `pg_execute_server_program` privileges can gain arbitrary code execution on the underlying operating system, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation is achieved through the `COPY FROM PROGRAM` SQL command.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs:\n\n*   Valid database credentials with superuser or `pg_execute_server_program` permissions, OR\n*  To exploit an SQL injection vulnerability in an application that has PostgreSQL on the backend."
