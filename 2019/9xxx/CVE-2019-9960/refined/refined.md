The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, and it directly relates to CVE-2019-9960. The commit message indicates a fix for a security issue where a relative path was allowed, which is the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-9960.

Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided diff:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `downloadZip` function within `application/controllers/admin/export.php`.  Prior to the fix, the `$sZip` variable, which was intended to be the name of a zip file, was directly used in the path construction ` $aZIPFileName = $sTempDir.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$sZip;`. If the `$sZip` variable contained a relative path, it could be used to access files outside of the intended temporary directory, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue where a malicious user could provide a relative path in the `$sZip` variable and force the system to access files outside the intended temporary directory. This is achieved by including "../" sequences in the `$sZip` path.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code lacked proper sanitization or validation of the `$sZip` variable before using it to construct a file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the server by crafting a malicious relative path in the `$sZip` parameter.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, including configuration files, application code, or data files, could be exposed.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Depending on the files accessible, it could potentially lead to further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious user could submit a crafted `$sZip` parameter containing relative path sequences ("../") to the `exportMultipleSurveys` function, which eventually calls the vulnerable `downloadZip` function.
- The exact method of sending the `$sZip` parameter was not explicitly included in the provided diff. It would likely be via POST or GET, which needs analysis of the surrounding code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to trigger the `exportMultipleSurveys` function with a controlled `$sZip` value. This would likely require an authenticated user, with at least the privileges to initiate an export.
- The attacker does not require any prior access to the system and would likely be an authenticated user of the LimeSurvey application
- The attacker needs to know how to provide the malicious input to the vulnerable function, possibly through a form parameter, or other input method
**Mitigation:**
- The fix implements a `get_absolute_path()` function call to sanitize the `$sZip` variable which prevents access to directories outside of the temporary directory.
-   This enforces that the provided path is within the defined directory structure
