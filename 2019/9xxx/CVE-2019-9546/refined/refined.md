- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper settings of the `erl.exe` service, specifically, the process current directory is set to `C:\ProgramData\SolarWinds\Orion\RabbitMQ\`, which is writable by standard users. The service executes `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c handle.exe /accepteula -s -p 1180 2> nul` as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` every five seconds.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The service attempts to execute `handle.exe` from the current directory before the system path. Since the current directory is user-writable, a malicious `handle.exe` could be placed there.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- **Attack vectors**: Placing a malicious `handle.exe` in the service's current working directory (`C:\ProgramData\SolarWinds\Orion\RabbitMQ\`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access to the system with the ability to write files to the directory `C:\ProgramData\SolarWinds\Orion\RabbitMQ\`.
