## ACTIVE-2019-005: SolarWinds Local Privilege Escalation

### Vulnerability Type:

Privilege Escalation

### Vendors:

SolarWinds Worldwide, LLC

### CVE ID:

CVE-2019-9546

### Affected Products:

* SolarWinds IP Address Manager v4.7.0
* SolarWinds Log Manager for Orion v1.1.0
* SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager v7.8
* SolarWinds Orion Network Performance Monitor v12.3
* SolarWinds Orion Network Traffic Analyzer v4.4
* SolarWinds Server & Application Monitor v6.7
* SolarWinds Server Configuration Monitor v1.0
* SolarWinds Storage Resource Monitor v6.7
* SolarWinds User Device Tracker v3.3.1
* SolarWinds Virtualization Manager v8.3
* SolarWinds VoIP and Network Quality Manager v4.5
* SolarWinds Web Performance Monitor v2.2.2
* SolarWinds Patch Manager v2.1
* Access Rights Manager 8MAN v9.1.181.0

### Summary:

Multiple SolarWinds products suffer from local privilege escalation due to improper settings of `erl.exe` service, meaning the process current directory is set to `C:\ProgramData\SolarWinds\Orion\RabbitMQ\`. Moreover, the service execute the command `C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c handle.exe /accepteula -s -p 1180 2> nul` as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` every five seconds, naturally the process will first try to run the non-existing `handle.exe` binary from the current directory which happens to be writable by standard users.

### Mitigation:

Apply Orion Platform 2018.4 Hotfix 2 or higher.

### Credit:

This vulnerability was found by Hashim Jawad of ACTIVELabs.
