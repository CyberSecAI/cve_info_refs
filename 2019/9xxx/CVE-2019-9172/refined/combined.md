# Private MR Disclosed Through Related MR Commit API endpoint

**[HackerOne report #453400](https://hackerone.com/reports/453400)** by ngalog on 2018-12-01:

**Summary:**
A public project could set MRs to be accessible only by project members. (Project Settings -> Permissions)
After setting that permission, non-members will see a 403 when they visit `https://{gitlab}/api/v4/projects/{id}/merge_requests`
However when they visit `/projects/:id/repository/commits/:sha/merge_requests`, the details of the MR is disclosed nonetheless.

Reference: (API)[<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/commits.html#list-merge-requests-associated-with-a-commit>]

## Quick PoC in gitlab.com

* Visit <https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/9696224/merge_requests> without any session, you should expect to see 403. it proves MR of this project is confidential, not open to public.
* Visit <https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/9696224/repository/commits/f4ec51c29fdbf71c85e14809c21328135ba75c9f/merge_requests> without any session, you should see below response
