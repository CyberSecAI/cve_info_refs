The provided content describes a vulnerability related to private Merge Request (MR) disclosure in GitLab. This vulnerability is described in HackerOne report #453400 and has been assigned CVE-2019-9172.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent access control between two different API endpoints related to Merge Requests. While the `/api/v4/projects/{id}/merge_requests` endpoint correctly enforces permissions by returning a 403 error to non-members of a private project, the `/projects/:id/repository/commits/:sha/merge_requests` endpoint incorrectly discloses MR details to non-members.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inconsistent Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the inconsistent application of access control rules across different API endpoints.
- **Information Disclosure:** The `/projects/:id/repository/commits/:sha/merge_requests` endpoint leaks sensitive MR information that should only be visible to project members.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Private Information:** Non-members of a private GitLab project can access details of merge requests, including title, description, author, associated commits, and more. This information is intended to be confidential and accessible only to project members.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosed information can potentially be used to gain further insights into a project, identify potential targets, or enable other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Request:** The attack vector is through a specific API request to `/projects/:id/repository/commits/:sha/merge_requests`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Project ID and Commit SHA:** The attacker needs to know the ID of a project with private MRs, and the SHA of a commit associated with a merge request.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.

**Additional Information:**

- The content provides a quick proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability on gitlab.com by accessing specific API URLs with and without an active session.
- The PoC shows how visiting `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/9696224/merge_requests` results in a 403 error (expected behavior), while visiting `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/9696224/repository/commits/f4ec51c29fdbf71c85e14809c21328135ba75c9f/merge_requests` discloses the MR details (vulnerable behavior).
