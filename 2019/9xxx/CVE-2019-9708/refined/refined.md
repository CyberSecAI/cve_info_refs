Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions within the Mahara application. Specifically, the system's 'root' user, which should be protected, is accessible and modifiable via the user administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insecure Object Reference:** The application does not properly restrict access to the 'root' user. By manipulating the URL parameter `id` in `admin/users/edit.php`, a site administrator can access and modify the 'root' user's information.
2.  **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** The application does not validate the user ID input when editing users, allowing an administrator to access the 'root' user by changing the `id` parameter in the URL.
3.  **Insufficient Access Controls:** Site administrators, while having elevated privileges, should not have the ability to suspend or modify the 'root' user. The application lacks the necessary restrictions to prevent this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A site administrator can suspend the 'root' user. Since the system relies on this user for core functionality, suspending it results in all other users being locked out of the system, effectively rendering the Mahara site unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct URL Manipulation:**  An attacker, with site administrator access, navigates to the user search page, clicks on a user's profile, and then manipulates the URL parameter `id` to point to the root user's ID (which is 0). Then they can proceed to modify/suspend the root user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Site Administrator Access:** The attacker must have site administrator privileges within the Mahara application to access the user administration panel.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects Mahara versions 17.10 before 17.10.8, 18.04 before 18.04.4, and 18.10 before 18.10.1.
* The bug report indicates that a fix has been released in versions 17.10.8, 18.04.4, 18.10.1 and 19.04.0.
* The fix involved preventing anyone from viewing or modifying the root user and preventing the root user from being suspended.
