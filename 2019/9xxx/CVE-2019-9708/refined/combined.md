### Bug Description

A site admin can break the site by suspending the 'root' user

To replicate:

1) Login in as a site admin

2) Go to Administration -> Users -> User search (admin/users/search.php)

3) Click on the 'username' link of any user

4) Change the url and make the id= part equal to 0 (eg admin/users/edit.php?id=0)

You now can see information for the hidden 'root' user

5) Suspend the user

6) Logout

7) Login again and you get something like

Mahara: Site unavailable

Something in the way you're interacting with Mahara is causing an error.

Details if any, follow:

Your account has been suspended as of 2019-02-22 10:56:34.<br />The reason for your suspension is: Bad mojo

Things to fix:

1) Not allow anyone see the the mahara 'root' user via the admin/users/edit.php page

2) Make sure systems that suspend a user, eg rejecting consent to privacy statement can't suspend 'root' user

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.
