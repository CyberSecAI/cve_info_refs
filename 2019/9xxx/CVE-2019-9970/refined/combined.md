﻿- - --= Blaze Information Security / Security Advisory --=
1. Advisory information- - - -------------------
Title: Signal IDN homograph attacksAdvisory reference: BLAZE-01-2019Product: SignalDisclosure mode: Coordinated disclosure
2. Product description- - - ------------------
Signal is an encrypted communications app for Android and iOS. A desktop version is also available for Linux, Windows, and macOS.It uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos,and make one-to-one voice and video calls.
Signal uses standard cellular mobile numbers as identifiers, and uses end-to-end encryption to secure all communications toother Signal users. The applications include mechanisms by which users can independently verify the identity of theirmessaging correspondents and the integrity of the data channel. (from Signal's Wikipedia page)
3. Vulnerability details- - - --------------------
Signal Desktop and Android are vulnerable to an IDN homograph attack when displaying messages containing URLs.
Homograph attack is a security vulnerability that can deceive users into thinking they are visiting a certainwebsite when in fact they are directed to a different, but homograph, domain name. This type of vulnerability can beused to weaponize social engineering, significantly increasing the chances for a successful attack.
Upon receiving a message with a link, Signal renders it in a clickable format and the font used to display the messagemakes it impossible to distinguish between the legitimate URL and the malicious URL, for example:
Legitimate URL: http://blazeinfosec.comMalicious URL: http://blаzeinfosec.com - with the 'a' as a Cyrillic character, not Latin
Upon clicking on the malicious link, a user will be taken to http://xn--blzeinfosec-zij.com/ instead of the realhttp://blazeinfosec.com, despite the fact the link is displayed exactly as the expected web site.
A sample attack scenario against a Signal mobile user:
- - An activist or person of interest uses Signal for Android- - The person receives a URL in a Signal message disguised as a legitimate one and clicks on the link- - The malicious URL serves a one-click browser exploit- - Target gets infected with mobile malware
Additionally, the mobile version of Tor Browser (Orfox, in Android) is vulnerable to the same classof attack. Therefore, users of Signal with Tor Browser (which does not seem to be a rare combination)are vulnerable to full-blown phishing attacks.
4. Fix and recommendations- - - ----------------------
Blaze Information Security recommends Signal to "defang" URLs just like it is done in its iOS version.URLs with mixed scripts (e.g., Latin and Cyrillic in the same domain name) or URLs using scripts notinstalled or enabled in the device should be displayed in the message as un-clickable.
Alternatively, Signal could implement the same strategy used by WhatsApp to mark the link as insecure, with aclear warning message to the user when an IDN homograph domain name is encountered in the message.
The vulnerability has been addressed by Signal at least in version 4.35.3 for Android.As of now, Windows-based Signal for Desktop is still vulnerable. Users should upgrade Signal to its latest version.
5. Credits- - - ------

6. Disclosure timeline- - - ----------------------
31/01/2019: Initial contact asking for the vendor's PGP key31/01/2019: Vendor responded asking for details of the vulnerability to be sent, surprisingly, via unencrypted e-mail31/01/2019: Vulnerability details sent via unencrypted mail01/02/2019: Signal responds "it seems like standard behavior here is to rely on the browser to disambiguatethese names (and the registrar to prevent issuance of ambiguous names)."01/02/2019: Blaze responds citing one-click exploits and the case of Ahmed Mansoor and Pegasus malware as a credible attack scenario03/02/2019: Blaze sends a report to Signal informing Tor Browser for Android is vulnerable, turning it into a full phishing chain12/02/2019: Signal responds "We don't consider this a 'vulnerability' or 'bug'", despite evidence showing otherwise.Unknown 2019: A fix was released - the vendor never informed Blaze about the fix.23/03/2019: Advisory released
