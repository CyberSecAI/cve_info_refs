- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Signal Desktop and Android applications are vulnerable to IDN homograph attacks when displaying URLs in messages. The applications render the URLs in a clickable format, and the font used makes it impossible to distinguish between legitimate and malicious URLs that use visually similar characters from different scripts (e.g., Latin and Cyrillic).

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - IDN homograph vulnerability: The applications do not properly sanitize or validate URLs containing mixed scripts or scripts not enabled on the device. This allows attackers to create malicious URLs that look identical to legitimate ones.
    - Lack of URL defanging: Unlike the iOS version of Signal, the vulnerable versions do not "defang" URLs with mixed scripts or unsupported scripts. This means that visually similar but technically different URLs are rendered as clickable links.
    - Absence of warning mechanisms: The vulnerable versions do not implement a warning mechanism similar to WhatsApp to alert users about potentially insecure IDN homograph domain names.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Phishing attacks: Attackers can use the vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites by embedding malicious URLs disguised as legitimate ones within Signal messages.
    - Malware infection: By redirecting users to malicious websites, attackers can leverage browser exploits or other malicious techniques to install malware on the target device.
    - Social engineering attacks: The vulnerability can be weaponized for social engineering attacks, deceiving users into trusting malicious URLs.
    - Full-blown phishing attacks can occur when the attack is combined with Tor browser on Android (Orfox).

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a malicious URL in a Signal message.
    - The malicious URL uses visually similar characters from different scripts to impersonate a legitimate URL.
    - User clicks on the malicious link in the message.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to send Signal messages to the target user
    - Knowledge of IDN homograph attacks and ability to craft such URLs.
