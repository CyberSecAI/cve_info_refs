Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9535:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how iTerm2 integrates with tmux's control mode. Specifically, iTerm2 doesn't properly sanitize or handle malicious output sent to the terminal through tmux integration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of tmux control sequences allows the injection of arbitrary commands via terminal output.
- Lack of proper sanitization of terminal output in the tmux integration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution on the user's computer. An attacker can execute any command as the user running iTerm2, with full privileges of that user.
- Complete compromise of the target machine is possible if an attacker executes malicious commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- Connecting to a malicious SSH server that sends malicious tmux control sequences as part of its output.
- Using `curl` to fetch a malicious website that outputs exploit payloads to the terminal.
- Using `tail -f` to follow a log file containing malicious output designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- Any command that results in output to the terminal can be a potential vector if attacker controls output.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to generate output that is displayed in the user's iTerm2 terminal when the tmux integration is enabled.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the user's machine but does need to have a way to generate terminal output which the user is viewing via iTerm2. This can be achieved by hosting a malicious server, or controlling a log file that the user is following, or other similar attack vectors.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in iTerm2 for at least 7 years.
- The vulnerability is considered critical due to the ease with which commands generally considered safe can be exploited and the potential impact it allows.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Radically Open Security during a security audit funded by the Mozilla Open Source Support Program.
- The fix is available in iTerm2 version 3.3.6.
- The tmux integration cannot be disabled through configuration, however, best practices are provided by iTerm2.
-  CVSS score: Base 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
