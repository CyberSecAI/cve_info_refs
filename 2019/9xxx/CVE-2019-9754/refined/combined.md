Dear all,

While fuzzing tcc, an out of bounds write was found in the end_macro
function.

Attached are a file producing a crash when compiled and the output of
valgrind.

To reproduce, compile the attached input file with tcc

    tcc end_macro.c

The latest git version of tcc (commit
4b46e0ec630531fa85d742706272525bebea49d2) was tested.
