Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9670:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw within the Autodiscover Servlet of Zimbra Collaboration Suite.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The Autodiscover Servlet improperly parses XML input, allowing an attacker to inject external entities. This can lead to the server processing attacker-controlled external content.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  The Proxy Servlet in Zimbra is vulnerable to SSRF. By manipulating the target parameter of the proxy request, an attacker can make the server send requests to internal resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The XXE vulnerability allows reading of arbitrary files on the server, including the Zimbra configuration file (`/opt/zimbra/conf/localconfig.xml`) which contains the LDAP password for the `zimbra` account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining the `zimbra` user's LDAP credentials, an attacker can then authenticate to the Zimbra system as that user. Then using a SSRF vulnerability they can escalate privileges to administrator level.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  After obtaining admin access, the attacker can upload a JSP webshell via the Client Upload servlet and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **XXE via Autodiscover Servlet:** The attacker sends a crafted XML request to the `/autodiscover` endpoint, injecting an external entity to read the `localconfig.xml` file, which reveals the LDAP password for the `zimbra` user.
2.  **Authentication:** Using the leaked `zimbra` user credentials, the attacker sends a SOAP `AuthRequest` to the `/service/soap/` endpoint and obtains a user authentication cookie.
3.  **SSRF via Proxy Servlet:** With the user authentication cookie, the attacker makes a request to the `/service/proxy/` endpoint, using the SSRF vulnerability to proxy an `AuthRequest` to the admin port (7071) and obtains an admin cookie
4.  **Webshell Upload:** Using the obtained admin cookie, the attacker uploads a malicious JSP webshell to the server via the `/service/extension/clientUploader/upload` endpoint.
5.  **Command Execution:** The attacker accesses the uploaded webshell via `/downloads/<webshell>.jsp` to execute commands on the host.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Zimbra server (port 8443, or configured port).
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication to the Zimbra application.
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests (POST) with XML payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Zimbra Collaboration Suite versions 8.5 to 8.7.11.
*   The exploit chain uses two vulnerabilities (XXE and SSRF) to achieve remote code execution.
*   The provided Metasploit module automates this entire exploit chain.
*   Patches are available to address this vulnerability in version 8.7.11 patch 10.
