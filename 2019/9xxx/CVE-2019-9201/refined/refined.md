Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication for the PCWorx protocol used in Phoenix Contact's ILC and AXC series industrial controllers. Specifically, the communication protocols used for device management and configuration do not require authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authentication mechanisms when interacting with the controllers via TCP port 1962. This allows unauthenticated access to the device's configuration and management functions.
*   **Unauthenticated FTP Access:** The "Create Backup" feature exposes a vulnerability by using FTP on port 21 without any authentication. This allows an attacker to download the entire configuration, including project files, in clear text.
*   **Directory Traversal:** It's also noted that the attacker could potentially traverse directories, gaining access to the root folder of the controller.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could:
*   Change the IP address of the controller
*   Modify the clock settings
*   Start/Stop the PLC
*   Backup the entire configuration of the PLC and project files
*   Update/Modify the firmware
*   Enable/disable firmware services
*   Download device code/configuration
*   Start or stop services
*   Modify firmware
*   Shutdown the device

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The controllers are vulnerable when exposed on open networks without firewall protection.
*   **Port 1962:**  Attackers establish TCP sessions to port 1962 to interact with the PCWorx protocol.
*   **Port 21:** Attackers can use FTP to download project files and configuration settings.
*   **Public Internet:** Vulnerable controllers were found exposed directly to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to reach the vulnerable controllers. This can be through an unprotected industrial network or even the public internet if the devices are exposed.
*   **Basic Protocol Knowledge:** Knowledge of the PCWorx protocol is useful for manipulating the device. An attacker could use free tools provided by Phoenix Contact, or common tools like NMAP.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker doesn't need any valid credentials.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Sergiu Sechel and re-discovered by Forescout.
*   More than 1,200 ILC controllers and 66 AXC 1050 controllers with this vulnerability have been identified, primarily located in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey.
*   The affected devices were the following:
    *   ILC 131 ETH
    *   ILC 131 ETH/XC
    *   ILC 151 ETH
    *  ILC 151 ETH/XC
    *   ILC 171 ETH 2TX
    *   ILC 191 ETH 2TX
    *   ILC 191 ME/AN
    *   AXC 1050
