Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-9741:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `net/http` package in Go does not properly sanitize or encode carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`) in URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CRLF Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject CRLF sequences into the URL parameters. This occurs because the `http.NewRequest` function, when constructing a new HTTP request, does not encode these characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **HTTP Header Injection:** By injecting `\r\n` followed by custom header fields, an attacker can manipulate HTTP headers. This can potentially allow them to:
    -  Bypass security checks or access controls if the server relies on specific headers
    -  Fool web services by injecting unexpected headers
- **Command Injection in Simple Services:** The injected CRLF sequences can be used to send commands to simple services that utilize a line-based protocol (e.g. Redis, Memcached).

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is via a crafted URL, where an attacker controls (or can influence) a parameter value that is used by the `http.NewRequest` function or other similar HTTP client function.
-  This can happen when processing requests received from external or untrusted sources

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control of URL Parameter:** The attacker needs the ability to control or manipulate a URL parameter that will be processed by the vulnerable application.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious request to the vulnerable system.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker injects the `\r\n` character sequence into the second argument of the `http.NewRequest` function.
- This injection allows the attacker to effectively inject arbitrary HTTP headers, which can be abused as described in the impact section.
- Demonstrated attacks include injecting a `X-injected: header` header, as well as issuing `SET` commands to Redis, showing how the injected content is processed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content shows that this vulnerability was addressed in Go version 1.12.1, and is present in golang versions 1.11.5, 1.11.6.
- Red Hat and Debian issued security advisories to address this vulnerability in their respective packages.
