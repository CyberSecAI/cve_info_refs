   - **Root cause:** The `ReadNextCell` function contains a heap-buffer-overflow, causing memory corruption.
   - **Weaknesses:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of cell data.
    - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**3. Stack-based buffer overflow in `InflateDimensions` (inflate.c:409)**
   - **Root cause:** The `InflateDimensions` function has a stack-based buffer overflow when processing dimensions of an inflated object.

    - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**4. Stack-based buffer overflow in `Mat_VarReadNextInfo5` (mat5.c:5757)**
   - **Root cause:** The `Mat_VarReadNextInfo5` function has a stack-based buffer overflow while handling variable names. The code attempts to allocate memory based on a length read from the file, which can be maliciously large.
   - **Weaknesses:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient size checks when copying data into a buffer on the stack.
   - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**5. Stack-based buffer overflow in `Mat_VarReadNextInfo5` (mat5.c:5767)**
  - **Root cause**: Similar to the previous vulnerability, this stack-based buffer overflow in `Mat_VarReadNextInfo5` occurs when reading a name packed within a tag. The length is derived from the buffer, and a large, attacker-controlled value causes an overflow in memcpy.
   - **Weaknesses:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient size checks when handling packed names.
    - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**6. Out-of-bounds read in `Mat_VarFree` (mat.c:1473)**
    - **Root cause:** `Mat_VarFree` attempts to access memory out of bounds when freeing a variable.
    - **Weaknesses:** Out-of-bounds read while freeing variable metadata, causing a crash.
     - **Impact:** Crash due to memory access violation.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file triggering the freeing of a specific malformed variable
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**7. Out-of-bounds write in `Mat_VarFree` (mat.c:1473)**
    - **Root cause:** Similar to the out-of-bounds read, `Mat_VarFree` also has an out-of-bounds write issue during variable cleanup.
    - **Weaknesses:** Out-of-bounds write due to improper handling of structure fields during freeing.
     - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file triggering the freeing of a specific malformed variable
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**8. Stack-based buffer overflow in `ReadNextCell` (mat5.c:1293)**
    - **Root cause:** Another stack buffer overflow in `ReadNextCell` during processing cell data.
    - **Weaknesses:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of cell data.
     - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**9. Stack-based buffer overflow in `ReadNextCell` (mat5.c:1323)**
    - **Root cause:** Another stack buffer overflow in `ReadNextCell` during processing cell data when decompressing.
    - **Weaknesses:** Stack-based buffer overflow when handling cell data with compressed contents.
     - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**10. Heap-based buffer overflow in `ReadNextFunctionHandle` (mat5.c:1837)**
    - **Root cause:** Heap-based buffer overflow when handling function handles.
    - **Weaknesses:** Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of function handle data.
    - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
   - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

**11. Stack-based buffer overflow in `ReadNextStructField` (mat5.c:1629)**
     - **Root cause:** Stack buffer overflow during processing of structure fields.
    - **Weaknesses:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to improper handling of struct field data.
     - **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.

**12. Global buffer overflow in `Mat_VarPrint` (mat.c:1835)**
    - **Root cause:** The `Mat_VarPrint` function attempts to access a global array out of bounds when printing the data type of a variable. The data\_type field is used to index into a lookup array without proper bounds checking.
    - **Weaknesses:** Out-of-bounds read on the `data_type_desc` global array, causing a crash.
    -  **Impact:** Crash due to memory access violation.
    - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file causing an out-of-bounds access while printing
    - **Attacker capability:** Ability to provide a specially crafted MAT file to be parsed by the library.

    - **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds read in `ReadNextCell` during processing of compressed character data.
    - **Weaknesses:** Out-of-bounds read due to improper handling of compressed character data.
     - **Impact:** Crash due to memory access violation.
   - **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT file.
