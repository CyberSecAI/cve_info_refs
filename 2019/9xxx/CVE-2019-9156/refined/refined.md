Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the "TestTelnetConnection.jsp" administration tool of the Gemalto (Thales Group) DS3 Authentication Server / Ezio Server. Specifically, the "HOST_NAME" and "PORT_NUMBER" parameters are not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands into the "HOST_NAME" and "PORT_NUMBER" parameters.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The web application fails to sanitize user inputs, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the "asadmin" user on the server.
- **Potential System Compromise:** The ability to run commands as the "asadmin" user can lead to complete server compromise by an attacker. This can include data theft, malware installation or further attacks on the internal network

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the DS3 Authentication Server.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be authenticated as a user on the web interface, even with low-privileged "READ_ONLY" permissions.
- **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to "TestTelnetConnection.jsp" with injected OS commands in the "HOST_NAME" and "PORT_NUMBER" parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the DS3/Ezio Server.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid credentials to log into the web administration interface. The exploit does not require administrative privileges; "READ_ONLY" permissions are sufficient.
- **Web Application Knowledge:** The attacker must have some knowledge of web application exploitation techniques to craft the malicious HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable even with low-privileged "READ_ONLY" user accounts.
- There are restrictions: injected bash commands cannot contain spaces and the output of the bash commands has the same limitation. The report however shows how these limitations can be bypassed using bash tricks.
- The vulnerability exists in DS3 Authentication Server / Ezio Server versions prior to v3.1.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
- The vendor has released patches for this issue.
