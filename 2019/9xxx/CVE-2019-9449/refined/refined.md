Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9449:

**CVE Description:**

The provided text includes the following information related to CVE-2019-9449:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2019-9449
*   **References:** A-120141031, Upstream kernel (https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/%2B/db248780101f2ca2bc3c02598917e88dfdce3207)
*   **Type:** Information Disclosure (ID)
*   **Severity:** Moderate
*   **Component:** Touch driver

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue in the touch driver related to handling input lengths that exceed the command buffer size, specifically in the fts (FocalTech Systems) touch driver. The driver's callback mechanism wasn't correctly managing edge cases where input lengths were greater than the command buffer size, resulting in array out-of-bounds (OOB) read when parsing strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An array out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the touch driver's handling of input data. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The driver fails to properly validate input lengths against the buffer size, leading to the OOB read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read sensitive kernel memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is likely exploitable via interactions with the touch driver. This typically requires a malicious application to communicate with the driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have the ability to execute code on the device. This typically involves a malicious application installed on the device.
*   **Touch driver Interaction**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the touch driver.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is related to the fts touch driver and its string parsing logic.
*   The fix involves handling the OOB corner cases when parsing a string and includes simplifications of the string parsing logic.
*   The commit message also mentions "Fix array OOB issues in sysfs diag test interface.", suggesting the vulnerability is exploitable through the sysfs interface for diagnostic tests.

**Summary of Vulnerability Details**

The vulnerability in CVE-2019-9449 is a moderate severity information disclosure issue in the touch driver. By providing input with lengths greater than the command buffer, an attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially exposing sensitive information. The fix involves improved input handling to prevent the out-of-bounds access.
