Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a null pointer dereference in the `PoDoFo::Impose::PdfTranslator::setSource()` function, specifically when attempting to access the media box of a page that might not exist in the PDF document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The code attempts to dereference a pointer (`sourceDoc->GetPage(0)`) without checking if it's valid (i.e., not null), leading to a crash when the page is not found in the PDF. This occurs in `tools/podofoimpose/pdftranslator.cpp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crafted PDF file, lacking a page 0, can trigger the null pointer dereference, causing a segmentation fault and crashing the `podofoimpose` binary.
- **Unspecified other impact:** The vulnerability could lead to other unspecified impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A crafted PDF file can be sent to the `podofoimpose` binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious PDF file as input to the `podofoimpose` tool.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is within the `PoDoFo::Impose::PdfTranslator::setSource` function in `pdftranslator.cpp`.
- The vulnerability occurs when `sourceDoc->GetPage(0)` returns a null pointer, and the code subsequently attempts to call `GetMediaBox()` on this null pointer.

**Mitigation:**
- The fix involves adding a null check on the return value of `sourceDoc->GetPage(0)` before attempting to access the media box. If the page pointer is NULL, an exception is raised instead of proceeding with the null pointer dereference.

**Code Snippet of the Fix:**
```c++
PoDoFo::PdfPage* pFirstPage = sourceDoc->GetPage ( 0 );
if ( NULL == pFirstPage ) // Fixes CVE-2019-9199 (issue #40)
{
    PODOFO_RAISE_ERROR_INFO( ePdfError_PageNotFound, "First page (0) of source document not found" );
}
PoDoFo::PdfRect rect ( pFirstPage->GetMediaBox() );
```

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was discovered by the ACE Team at Loginsoft.
- The fix was backported to Fedora 29 and 30.
- The vulnerable code is located in `tools/podofoimpose/pdftranslator.cpp` in the PoDoFo library, version 0.9.6 and earlier.
- The fix has been implemented in the upstream repository, and can be seen in the provided github links.
