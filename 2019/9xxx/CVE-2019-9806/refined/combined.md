[screencast issue.gif](attachment.cgi?id=9041441)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9041441&action=edit)

[Affected versions]:

* 67.0a1 (2019-02-04)
* 66.0b5 (20190204181317)
* 65.0 (20190124174741)

[Affected platforms]:

* Windows 10 x64

[Steps to reproduce]:

1. Setup a simple FTP server
2. Use the following [test case](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PMivz7O8s91_-K7EKY4dScFx7qbglyB9)
3. Access the above test case via FTP server

[Expected result]:

* The auth prompt should not be displayed once more.

[Actual result]:

* Auth prompt is successively displayed, without any means to be dismissed.

[Regression range]:

* Not a regression, I can see this issue way back to Fx 31.0a1.

[Additional Notes]:

* Firefox can’t be escaped, only by ending its process.
* This behavior is not reproducible on Chrome.
* In order to create the FTP server, I used FileZilla.

FWIW, I don't understand, off-hand, why the auth prompts from FTP aren't being subjected to the same limits we added for http auth prompts. I'm assuming it's the same dialog. Hopefully Johann knows?

Pretty sure this is because we base it on the hostname. I can reproduce and will fix it later.

ftp urls have hostnames and origins.

Yeah, I think it's more because of the localhost part. We might still want to fix it.

Ok, Dan is right this is not related to hostname issues, but because we seem to take a different code path for prompting with ftp: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/ftp/nsFtpConnectionThread.cpp#758>

Gah.

Could we move FTP over to use the same stuff as HTTP? Presumably the mChannel reference here could be used to find the loadgroup and document / tabchild etc.

Maybe a dumb question, but why is html being parsed when retrieved over ftp to begin with?

Seems to me the root issue here is that the html is trying to use the ftp protocol as-if it was http, which it isn't, causing a flurry of ftp connections that the server eventually refuses (rate limiting, concurrent connection limits, etc.)

If this parsing isn't necessary, then this whole problem could be avoided by simply either displaying the source or (probably better) simply offering a download of the file. It's FTP after all.

I expect you could reproduce this issue if you hosted the html page on http:, but sourced images over ftp:.

Well, we display HTML content for file: protocol use as well (and data:, and blob:, and chrome:, and resource:, and about:, and moz-extension:, and ...). I don't know why you seem to believe it's only reasonable to do so over the http: protocol.

While there is some movement towards removing support for browsing HTML documents served over FTP in all browsers, we're not in a place where we can just pull such support unilaterally.

I don't believe it's only reasonable to use http: -- I never said that. But I do believe it's unreasonable to treat a remote transfer protocol like ftp: the same way as http: when it's clearly not suited or designed for the protocol behavior typical to http: (which the other mentioned protocols are).

You're absolutely right. So the issue is linked resources, not the html itself.

This also changes the name of 'canceledAuthenticationPromptCounter' to account for the

fact that we no longer count up when the prompt was cancelled, but when it was shown.

Considering that this is really just an extension of [bug 377496](/show_bug.cgi?id=377496 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Authentication Required' dialogue being application modal produces a vector for attack") and they were both fixed in the same release, we can probably unhide this. Do you agree, Dan?

[bug 1523249](/show_bug.cgi?id=1523249 "VERIFIED FIXED - FTP can open endless number of blocking popups, making Firefox unusable") is still hidden though, and this fix is related. It's probably too late to upload all the auth fixes to 66, but I'd be more comfortable holding off on opening this up for a bit...

Ok, fair enough, I think you're right. Let's keep it hidden for now.

Comment on [attachment 9047668](/attachment.cgi?id=9047668 "Bug 1525267 - Move auth prompt rate limiting to nsIAuthPrompt2.promptAuth. r=MattN") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9047668&action=edit "Bug 1525267 - Move auth prompt rate limiting to nsIAuthPrompt2.promptAuth. r=MattN")

[Bug 1525267](/show_bug.cgi?id=1525267 "VERIFIED FIXED - FTP triggers undismissable auth prompts") - Move auth prompt rate limiting to nsIAuthPrompt2.promptAuth. r=MattN

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **Feature/Bug causing the regression**: None
* **User impact if declined**: Protections introduced in [bug 377496](/show_bug.cgi?id=377496 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Authentication Required' dialogue being application modal produces a vector for attack") can be worked around by using FTP
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: Yes
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: No
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: Yes
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: See [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1525267#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - FTP triggers undismissable auth prompts"), also, we should check that HTML basic auth sites are still working as expected.
* **List of other uplifts needed**: [Bug 377496](/show_bug.cgi?id=377496 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Authentication Required' dialogue being application modal produces a vector for attack")
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Medium
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: This is basically just moving some code that has well baked in [bug 377496](/show_bug.cgi?id=377496 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Authentication Required' dialogue being application modal produces a vector for attack") and we have tests for the http variant, but it still hasn't baked a lot on Nightly
* **String changes made/needed**: None

|  | |

The same potential issue exists in both serial\_read\_mp\_array and read\_packet\_client:

SECStatus rv = SECSuccess;

P\_CHECKCB(upk != NULL); // NOTE: potential problem

... possibly more P\_CHECKCB conditions

msgpack\_unpacked res;

The P\_CHECKCB macro goes to cleanup, which does this:

cleanup:

msgpack\_unpacked\_destroy(&res);

The msgpack\_unpacked\_destroy function does this with the uninitialized memory:

static inline void msgpack\_unpacked\_destroy(msgpack\_unpacked\* result)

{

if(result->zone != NULL) {

msgpack\_zone\_free(result->zone);

result->zone = NULL;

memset(&result->data, 0, sizeof(msgpack\_object));

}

}

Yup, looks like a bug to me! I used the same faulty design pattern in a bunch of places in serial.c, so we should fix them all in one go.

An attacker would only be able to trigger this behavior if one of these buggy assertions (e.g., `P_CHECKCB(upk != NULL);`) fails, which shouldn't happen unless there is also a bug in the code that calls these functions.

In any event, we should fix this. Rob, do you want me to open a PR for this against the mozilla/libprio repo?

We should take this opportunity to figure out a good workflow for handling security bugs in libprio. Even though Prio is not enabled by default, we may start enabling it for some users so we should treat these like we would any security issue in Firefox.

I'm thinking we should have a private fork of libprio that we uplift from, then we can land patches in the public libprio repo when Mozilla is ready to announce security bugs. This would be a little more work since we'd need to keep both repos in sync but I don't think it'd be too bad.

I am waiting for input from our security folks to find out if we already have best practices around this, do you mind holding off opening a PR on the public repo for now?

OK so state-of-the art is to land a patch first, ship, then land in github when we've shipped. An example where this was done is libvorbis in [bug 1446062](/show_bug.cgi?id=1446062 "VERIFIED FIXED - ZDI-CAN-5822 - Mozilla Firefox Audio Driver Out of Bounds").

So I think there's no real point in bothering with a private github repo, the amount of work for the patch author is roughly the same, except for having to use two review systems :)

Henry, would you mind reviewing a patch? I think you just need to log in to phabricator with your bugzilla account to be able to do so:

Rob, after reviewing your patch, I grep'd through the libprio source to look for other places where I may have misused the msgpack API.

The only other place we use it is in `client.c` and it looks like there are indeed two similar bugs there. In particular, in `PrioClient_encode` and `PrioPacketClient_decrypt`, a failure early on in the function could cause the program to invoke `msgpack_*_destroy` on an uninitialized object.

* In `PrioClient_encode`, pulling the `msgpack_*_init` function calls up above the assertions should fix the bug.
* In `PrioPacketClient_decrypt`, line 346, we should do something like this to make sure that we don't call `msgpack_unpacker_destroy` after initialization has failed:
  ```
  if (!msgpack_unpacker_init(&upk, data_len)) {
    return SECFailure;
  }
  ...

  ```

Since we don't use the msgpack API anywhere else in libprio, I am cautiously optimistic that we will not find more instances of this particular type of bug elsewhere in the library.

Thanks for catching those! I'll amend the current patch.

[Bug 1521360](/show_bug.cgi?id=1521360 "RESOLVED FIXED - Two potential loads from uninitialized memory in Prio serial_read_mp_array and read_packet_client") - ensure that Prio early cleanup runs correctly r?henrycg

## Security Approval Request

### How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?

Per [bug 1521360 comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1521360#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Two potential loads from uninitialized memory in Prio serial_read_mp_array and read_packet_client"), this should only be exploitable if there is also a bug in the code calling these functions, which we do not believe to be the case.

### Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?

Yes

### Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?

release (65.0)

### If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?

None

### Do you have backports for the affected branches?

Yes

### If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?

### How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?

This feature (Prio) has complete unit tests and is preffed off by default, it probably does not need additional manual testing in addition to the automated tests.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-07

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 66

Announced
March 19, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 66

#### [#CVE-2019-9790: Use-after-free when removing in-use DOM elements](#CVE-2019-9790)

Reporter
Brandon Wieser
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using JavaScript and the element is then removed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1525145](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1525145)

#### [#CVE-2019-9791: Type inference is incorrect for constructors entered through on-stack replacement with IonMonkey](#CVE-2019-9791)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1530958](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530958)

#### [#CVE-2019-9792: IonMonkey leaks JS\_OPTIMIZED\_OUT magic value to script](#CVE-2019-9792)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal `JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT` magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1532599](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1532599)

#### [#CVE-2019-9793: Improper bounds checks when Spectre mitigations are disabled](#CVE-2019-9793)

Reporter
Bruno Keith & Niklas Baumstark from the phoenhex team
Impact
high
##### Description

A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range in circumstances where users have explicitly disabled Spectre mitigations.
 *Note: Spectre mitigations are currently enabled for all users by default settings.*

##### References

* [Bug 1528829](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528829)

#### [#CVE-2019-9794: Command line arguments not discarded during execution](#CVE-2019-9794)

Reporter
Joshua Graham
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1530103](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530103)

#### [#CVE-2019-9795: Type-confusion in IonMonkey JIT compiler](#CVE-2019-9795)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1514682](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1514682)

#### [#CVE-2019-9796: Use-after-free with SMIL animation controller](#CVE-2019-9796)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.

##### References

* [Bug 1531277](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1531277)

#### [#CVE-2019-9797: Cross-origin theft of images with createImageBitmap](#CVE-2019-9797)

Reporter
AaylaSecura1138
Impact
high
##### Description

Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the same-origin policy by exporting an image after using `createImageBitmap` to read the image and then rendering the resulting bitmap image within a `canvas` element.

#### [#CVE-2019-9798: Library is loaded from world writable APITRACE\_LIB location](#CVE-2019-9798)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert
Impact
high
##### Description

On Android systems, Firefox can load a library from `APITRACE_LIB`, which is writable by all users and applications. This could allow malicious third party applications to execute a man-in-the-middle attack if a malicious code was written to that location and loaded.
 *Note: This issue only affects Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9801: Windows programs that are not 'URL Handlers' are exposed to web content](#CVE-2019-9801)

Reporter
Daniel Veditz
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9802: Chrome process information leak](#CVE-2019-9802)

Reporter
Stephen Fewer
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download which will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process, which may include sensitive data.

#### [#CVE-2019-9803: Upgrade-Insecure-Requests incorrectly enforced for same-origin navigation](#CVE-2019-9803)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu, Vinothkumar Nagasayanan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources.

##### Description

In Firefox Developer Tools it is possible that pasting the result of the 'Copy as cURL' command into a command shell on macOS will cause the execution of unintended additional bash script commands if the URL was maliciously crafted. This is the result of an issue with the native version of Bash on macOS.
 *Note: This issue only affects macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
