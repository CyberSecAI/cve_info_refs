  "CVE-2019-9806": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists during authorization prompting for FTP transaction where successive modal prompts are displayed and cannot be immediately dismissed. This allows for a denial of service (DOS) attack.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a different code path being taken for FTP authentication prompts compared to HTTP prompts. This different path does not implement the same rate limiting mechanisms, leading to the ability to trigger an unlimited series of modal authentication prompts.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Lack of rate limiting on FTP authentication prompts, leading to excessive and undismissable prompts"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition where the user interface is flooded with undismissable authentication prompts, making the browser unusable.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves an attacker crafting a malicious FTP server or manipulating FTP resources to trigger repeated authentication challenges when accessed through the Firefox browser.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or manipulate an FTP server that the victim's Firefox browser accesses. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim."
