Based on the provided information, the content relates to CVE-2019-9034. The identified vulnerabilities in matio version 1.5.13 include heap-buffer-overflow, stack-buffer-overflow, out-of-bound read, out-of-bound write, and global-buffer-overflow issues.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow in `InflateVarName` (inflate.c:512):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A heap buffer overflow occurs within the `InflateVarName` function.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Processing a crafted MAT file triggers the vulnerability during variable name inflation.

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow in `ReadNextCell` (mat5.c:1353):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Another heap buffer overflow exists in the `ReadNextCell` function.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to the previous one, this can lead to memory corruption and crashes.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted MAT file can trigger the overflow during cell data reading.

*   **Stack-buffer-overflow in `InflateDimensions` (inflate.c:409):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `InflateDimensions` function.
    *   **Impact:** Can overwrite stack data, potentially leading to control-flow hijacking.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Processing a malformed MAT file causes the overflow during dimension inflation.

*   **Stack-buffer-overflow in `Mat_VarReadNextInfo5` (mat5.c:5757 and 5767):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Two stack buffer overflows are present within the `Mat_VarReadNextInfo5` function at different locations. Specifically at line 5757 an overflow occurs when copying the variable name to `matvar->name`. The size of the allocation is read from the input file, and if this value is maliciously crafted to be larger than the size of `buf`, a stack buffer overflow will occur.
    *   **Impact:** Stack corruption, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A crafted MAT file triggers the overflow during the reading of variable information.

*   **Out-of-bound read in `Mat_VarFree` (mat.c:1473):**
    *   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `Mat_VarFree` function.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to information disclosure or crashes due to invalid memory access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Triggered during the freeing of a MAT variable with specific properties.

*   **Out-of-bound write in `Mat_VarFree` (mat.c:1473):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  An out-of-bounds write occurs in the `Mat_VarFree` function.
    *   **Impact:** Can corrupt memory, leading to unpredictable behavior and potentially exploitable conditions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Triggered during MAT variable deallocation with specific characteristics.

*   **Stack-buffer-overflow in `ReadNextCell` (mat5.c:1293 and 1323):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Two stack buffer overflows are present within the `ReadNextCell` function at different locations.
    *   **Impact:** Stack corruption, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A crafted MAT file triggers the overflow during the reading of cell data.

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow in `ReadNextFunctionHandle` (mat5.c:1837):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow in `ReadNextFunctionHandle` function.
    *   **Impact:** Can corrupt memory, leading to unpredictable behavior and potentially exploitable conditions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A crafted MAT file triggers the overflow during the reading of a function handle.

*   **Stack-buffer-overflow in `ReadNextStructField` (mat5.c:1629):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow is present within the `ReadNextStructField` function.
    *   **Impact:** Stack corruption, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A crafted MAT file triggers the overflow during the reading of struct field data.

*   **Global-buffer-overflow in `Mat_VarPrint` (mat.c:1835):**
    *   **Root Cause:** A global buffer overflow occurs when printing MAT variable information.
    *   **Impact:** Can overwrite global data, leading to unpredictable behavior.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Triggered when printing a MAT variable with a specific data type. The code uses the `data_type` field of the `matvar` structure as an index into the `data_type_desc` array. If the `data_type` field is out of bounds, an out-of-bounds read occurs.

*   **Out-of-bound read in `ReadNextCell` (mat5.c:1342):**
    *   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `ReadNextCell` function.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to information disclosure or crashes due to invalid memory access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Triggered during the reading of cell data.

*All vulnerabilities:*
    *   **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted MAT files.
    *   **Impact:** Memory corruption, crashes, potential arbitrary code execution, and information disclosure.
    *   **Attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a crafted MAT file to be processed by the vulnerable software.
