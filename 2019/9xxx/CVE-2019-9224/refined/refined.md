{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/autocomplete_sources/milestones` endpoint was not respecting the project's visibility settings for issues, which were set to 'Only Project Members'.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information disclosure vulnerability. The endpoint exposed milestone data even when the issues tab was not publicly visible.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthorized user (non-project member) could view the milestones of a public project, which would normally be hidden if the project's issues were set to 'Only Project Members'.",
  "Attack vectors": "Accessing the vulnerable endpoint `/autocomplete_sources/milestones` via a web browser, or by triggering the request through the quick action `/milestone %milestone` in comments.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a non-project member with the knowledge of the specific endpoint URL. No special privileges required."
