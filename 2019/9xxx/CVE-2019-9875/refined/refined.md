{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-9875",
    "root_cause": "The CSRF protection mechanism in Sitecore deserializes the `__CSRFTOKEN` parameter without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious serialized .NET object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization of user-supplied data",
       "Lack of cryptographic signature verification during deserialization of the CSRF token."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to a vulnerable Sitecore page with a malicious serialized object in the `__CSRFTOKEN` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "For Sitecore versions 8.x, no authentication is required. For Sitecore versions 9.x < 9.1.1, authentication is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "poc": "The provided proof-of-concept uses `ysoserial.net` to generate a PowerShell downloader payload, which is then sent as the `__CSRFTOKEN` parameter. When deserialized, it downloads and executes a reverse shell script from a remote server.",
        "affected_versions": "Sitecore versions <= 9.1.0 are vulnerable. Specifically, 8.x versions are vulnerable without authentication, and 9.x versions < 9.1.1 are vulnerable with authentication."
