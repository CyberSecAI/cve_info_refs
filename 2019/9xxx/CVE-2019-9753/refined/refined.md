Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how the search result screens in OTRS handle invalid system entities. Specifically, when a user performs a search, the system doesn't properly sanitize or validate the data associated with certain system entities, leading to information disclosure.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the ability to disclose information from invalid system entities.
    *   **Improper Data Handling:** The system fails to properly handle or sanitize data related to certain entities during search result display.

* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view sensitive information that they should not have access to, including data related to custom pages, FAQ articles, service catalog items, and ITSM configuration items.
    *  The severity is rated as low because only limited information is leaked and no data can be modified.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the web interface.
    *   **Search Functionality:** The vulnerability is triggered through the search functionality within OTRS.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of OTRS, either as an agent or a customer user.
    *   **Access to Search:** The attacker needs access to the search functionality within OTRS.

* **Affected Products:**
    *   OTRS 7.0.x up to and including 7.0.4
    *   ITSMConfigurationManagement 7.0.x up to and including 7.0.4

* **Fix:**
    *   OTRS 7.0.5
    *   ITSMConfigurationManagement 7.0.5

* **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
    *   **AV:N** (Attack Vector: Network)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    *   **UI:R** (User Interaction: Required)
    *  **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   **C:L** (Confidentiality: Low)
    *  **I:N** (Integrity: None)
    *  **A:N** (Availability: None)
