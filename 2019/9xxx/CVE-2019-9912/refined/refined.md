**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The wpGoogleMaps WordPress plugin echoes the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable without proper encoding within a hidden input field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of sanitization of the `PHP_SELF` variable allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected web application. This can lead to:
* Bypassing CSRF protection
* Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
* Reading data accessible to the user
* Redirecting the user to malicious sites
* Defacing the web page

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript payload in the `admin.php` path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking the malicious link. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to perform the attack. User interaction is required (UI:R in CVSS).
