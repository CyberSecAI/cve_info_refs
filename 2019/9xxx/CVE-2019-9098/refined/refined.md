Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an integer overflow that occurs during memory allocation. This overflow leads to unexpected memory allocation size that is smaller than required.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow (CWE-680): The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow, which occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the variable, leading to incorrect memory allocation.
- Buffer Overflow: The undersized memory allocation, caused by integer overflow, can lead to a buffer overflow when data is written into the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a buffer overflow.
- The buffer overflow may result in denial of service (DoS), or potentially arbitrary code execution on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the device's web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Summary of Information from both sources:**

Both the Moxa advisory and the ICS-CERT advisory provide consistent information about CVE-2019-9098.  The Moxa advisory is more succinct, providing the basics, while the ICS-CERT advisory provides a more detailed description and the CVSS score. Both sources state that an integer overflow leads to a buffer overflow. The impact is similar in both - denial of service or arbitrary code execution.  The attack vector is remote via the web server and no special privileges or user interaction is required.
