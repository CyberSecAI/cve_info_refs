  "CVE-2019-9456": {
    "Description": "In the Android kernel in Pixel C USB monitor driver there is a possible OOB write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.",
    "Root cause": "The USB monitor driver in the Android kernel lacks a bounds check, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local escalation of privilege could be achieved.",
    "Attack vector": "Local exploitation.",
    "Required capabilities": "System execution privileges are needed for exploitation."
