Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper comment content filtering within WordPress. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a combination of mishandled CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection and incorrect Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of `<a>` elements. This leads to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain administrative access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Improper Comment Filtering:** WordPress fails to adequately sanitize and filter comment content before storing it in the database.
2.  **CSRF Mishandling:** The CSRF protection mechanism is flawed, which allows attackers to bypass security measures.
3.  **XSS via SEO of `<a>` Elements:** The way WordPress handles `<a>` elements for SEO purposes creates an avenue for XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The improper filtering of comment content can lead to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Exploiting the vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Administrative Access:** Attackers can leverage XSS to potentially gain administrative access to the WordPress site, leading to full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Users:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users due to the mishandling of CSRF protection
*   **Maliciously crafted comments:** Attackers can inject malicious code into comments that are submitted to a WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   No prior authentication is required to submit a comment, making exploitation possible for any user or automated system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to submit a specially crafted comment to a vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Simon Scannell of RIPS Technologies.
*   WordPress versions 5.1 and earlier are affected.
*   The fix was released in WordPress version 5.1.1.
*   The vulnerability is also mentioned in Debian Security Advisories DSA-4677-1 and DLA-1742-1.

The provided content gives more detail than the basic CVE description, explaining the specific weaknesses (CSRF, SEO issues leading to XSS), the specific attack vectors (unauthenticated users, maliciously crafted comments), and how the exploit leads to RCE and potentially administrative access, which provides a better understanding of the vulnerability.
