Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9023:

**1. Verification:**

   - The content from multiple sources, including SUSE, Red Hat, and the PHP bug tracker, confirms that the provided information is related to CVE-2019-9023. The official description mentions a heap-based buffer over-read in the mbstring regular expression functions of PHP, and this vulnerability is discussed in detail in the provided text.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   - **Root Cause:**
     - The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way PHP's `mbstring` extension handles regular expressions, specifically when processing invalid multibyte character sequences.
     - Multiple instances of heap-based buffer over-read occur within the `mbstring` regular expression functions. The flawed logic exists in `ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regcomp.c`, `ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regexec.c`, `ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regparse.c`, `ext/mbstring/oniguruma/enc/unicode.c` and `ext/mbstring/oniguruma/src/utf32_be.c`
     - The `fetch_token` function, when encountering an incomplete multibyte character at the end of a string, may return a pointer after the end of the buffer, leading to out-of-bounds memory access during string operations.
      -The `utf32be_mbc_to_code` function assumes a buffer contains 4 extra characters for a valid utf32 character, but fails to handle unterminated multibyte characters.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
     - Heap-based buffer over-read in `mbstring` regex functions.
     - Incorrect length calculations within `compile_string_node`, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
     - `memcpy` misuse due to invalid negative lengths.
     - Uninitialized reads during case folding operations.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a PHP crash, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
     - Potential for information disclosure by reading beyond allocated memory.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - The primary attack vector is through crafted multibyte regular expression patterns or malformed input containing invalid or incomplete multibyte characters.
     - An attacker could use a hostile DNS server, crafted XML or  malicious LDAP server to send malicious data to cause PHP to misbehave.
     - Exploitation occurs during parsing of a .phar file.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker needs to be able to supply specially crafted input to PHP's `mbstring` regex functions (e.g. `mb_split, mb_ereg`) or use crafted DNS, XML, or LDAP responses.
     - No authentication is required, and the vulnerability can be exploited over a network.

**3. Additional Notes:**

 - The vulnerability affects PHP versions prior to 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1.
   - Patches for the vulnerability involve careful handling of buffer boundaries, ensuring proper multibyte character handling, and avoiding incorrect memory operations.
   - Red Hat rated the severity as "Moderate" while SUSE has given a rating of "low". The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) has assigned a base score of 9.8 (Critical) under CVSS v3.
  - There are different attack vectors which are mainly in code parsing specific formats.
 -  The SUSE information specifies a local attack vector for one of the CVSS scores.
- Patches include checking of  `sn->end` instead of `end`
-   Patches from php developers include checking that the string pointer does not go past the allocated buffer end, fixing `strlen` errors, and using `OnigCodePoint` in correct way,
