{
  "ID": "CVE-2019-9148",
  "Summary": "The Mailvelope browser extension lacks proper message and key validity checks. This can lead to a variety of issues such as accepting invalid keys, improper signature verification, and other unexpected behaviors. It also allows importing keys without a valid self-certification, and makes no restrictions on the keys that can be imported (i.e. invalid keys are accepted during import).",
  "Technical Details": {
    "Root Cause": "Insufficient validation of keys and signatures during processing in the Mailvelope browser extension.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Acceptance of keys without valid self-certifications.",
        "Lack of restrictions on imported keys, including invalid keys.",
        "Incorrect handling of messages signed with invalid keys. Messages are either presented as unsigned or signed by an unknown signer instead of explicitly indicating signature validation failure.",
         "Acceptance of secondary user IDs not visible during key import.",
         "Absence of validation for key validity, key expiration, and signature revocation status."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can trick a user into using invalid keys, accepting fraudulent signatures, and can potentially achieve message tampering.",
    "Attack Vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker intercepts and modifies keys or messages.",
      "Social engineering attacks where users are tricked into importing manipulated keys.",
       "Exploitation of vulnerabilities in a whitelisted web application."
    ],
    "Attacker Capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept and modify communications, specifically keys and messages.",
      "Control over a web application, either by exploiting a vulnerability or by social engineering to trick users into whitelisting the attacker's site.",
      "The ability to create/modify OpenPGP keys or messages."
    ]
  },
  "Additional Information": {
    "Details": "The report details how Mailvelope does not perform adequate checks on keys during import or usage. This includes acceptance of user IDs without valid self-certifications, allowing expired keys, revoked keys and invalid signatures. It also fails to properly communicate to the user that something has gone wrong when the checks fail.",
     "Additional Notes": "The document also mentions, Mailvelope also makes no restrictions on the keys that can be imported. Keys that are obviously invalid should be rejected during import (e.g. when the primary user certification is missing or invalid)."
