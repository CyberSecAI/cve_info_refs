  "CVE-2019-9494": {
    "Description": "The implementations of SAE in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to side channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side channel attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.",
    "Root cause": "Timing and cache-based side-channel attack vulnerabilities exist in the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) implementation in hostapd and wpa_supplicant due to observable timing differences and cache access patterns during the Dragonfly handshake.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel attack",
       "Timing attack",
      "Cache-based attack",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker may be able to leak information about the used password based on observable timing differences and cache access patterns, potentially leading to full password recovery when combined with an offline dictionary attack.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote",
        "Adjacent network"

     "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be within radio range and have the ability to execute code on a device that participates in the WPA3 SAE handshake."

    "Description": "The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. All versions of hostapd and wpa_supplicant with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The ability to install and execute applications is necessary for a successful attack. Memory access patterns are visible in a shared cache. Weak passwords may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa_supplicant 2.7 and newer, are not vulnerable to the timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.",

  "CVE-2019-9496": {
    "Description": "An invalid authentication sequence could result in the hostapd process terminating due to missing state validation steps when processing the SAE confirm message when in hostapd/AP mode. All version of hostapd with SAE support are vulnerable. An attacker may force the hostapd process to terminate, performing a denial of service attack. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.",
     "Root cause": "Missing state validation when processing the SAE confirm message in hostapd's AP mode leads to process termination.",

This vulnerability may allow an attacker to complete EAP-PWD authentication without knowing the password. However, unless the crypto library does not implement additional checks for the EC point, the attacker will not be able to derive the session key or complete the key exchange. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected.
