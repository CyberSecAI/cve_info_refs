{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The NGINX default configuration file has a check to verify the status of a user cookie. If not set, it redirects a user to the login page. However, an arbitrary value can be provided for this cookie to bypass the authentication check and access the web interface without valid user credentials.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to insufficient validation of user cookies.",
       "Exposure of SoftNAS StorageCenter ports directly to the internet."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain access to the Webadmin interface, create new users, and execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges, potentially leading to complete compromise of the platform and the data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending an HTTP request with an arbitrary value set for the user cookie.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SoftNAS Cloud instance, specifically to the exposed Webadmin interface ports. No valid user credentials are required."
