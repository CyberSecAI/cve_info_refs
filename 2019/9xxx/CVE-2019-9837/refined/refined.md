The provided content relates to CVE-2019-9837.  The vulnerability is an open redirect in the doorkeeper-openid_connect Ruby gem.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Vulnerability:** Open Redirect
*   **Root Cause:** The `redirect_uri` parameter, when passed with `prompt=none`, isn't validated before redirection in case of an error. The vulnerable code is located in `lib/doorkeeper/openid_connect/helpers/controller.rb`. Specifically, the `redirect_uri` is extracted directly from the incoming parameters without validation.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can craft a malicious authorization request to the Identity Provider with `prompt=none` and a `redirect_uri` pointing to an attacker-controlled site.  If the authorization request results in an error (e.g., mismatched scopes), the user will be redirected to the malicious URI.
*   **Impact:**  The attacker can redirect the user to a phishing site, potentially tricking them into entering their credentials. The issue describes a scenario where the attacker uses a phishing form after the user is redirected to the attacker's site. Because the user initiated the authorization flow from the legitimate Identity Provider, they might be more likely to trust the attacker-controlled site.
*   **Conditions:** The user must have previously authorized with the Identity Provider. The attacker needs to trigger an error during the authorization flow when `prompt=none` is used. An example error condition is when requesting different claims than previously authorized.
*   **Affected Parameter:** `redirect_uri`
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves validating the `redirect_uri` parameter before redirection. The pull request ([#66](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper-openid_connect/pull/66)) addresses this issue.
