- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NetBackup Appliance Web Console displays the configured proxy server password in plain text to an administrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is caused by insecure storage and retrieval of the proxy server password, which is exposed in the web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An administrator with access to the NetBackup Appliance Web Console can retrieve the proxy server password, even if the proxy server or call home features are disabled. This allows the administrator to access the proxy server for malicious purposes, such as changing the password which can prevent the appliance from using the proxy server, or other unauthorized activities on the proxy server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the NetBackup Appliance Web Console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator with access to the NetBackup Appliance Web Console.
