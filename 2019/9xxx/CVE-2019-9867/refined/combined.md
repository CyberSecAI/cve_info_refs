  /   [Security Alerts](/content/support/en_US/security.html)6. /  VTS19-001: Multiple Vulnerabilities in NetBackup Appliance

### Revisions

1.0: March 18, 2019: Initial release

1.1: March 19, 2019: Added CVE IDs

### Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities in Veritas NetBackup Appliance.

| Issue | Description | Severity | Fixed Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [SMTP password displayed to administrator](#Issue1) | Medium | March 2019 EEB |
| 2 | [Proxy server password displayed to administrator](#Issue2) | Medium | March 2019 EEB |

### Issues

#### Issue #1

SMTP password displayed to administrator.

CVE ID: [CVE-2019-9868](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9868)

Severity: Medium

CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.6 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L))

When using the NetBackup Appliance Web Console, if an SMTP password has been previously configured for use, an administrator can retrieve the password for the account if one has been specified, even if SMTP is not currently active. This exposes the full account credentials to the administrator allowing him to access the SMTP server for other purposes, e.g. to change the password thus preventing the appliance from sending email.

Affected Products

* NetBackup Appliance 3.1.2, 3.1.1, 3.1, 3.0, 2.7.3, and possibly earlier, unsupported versions without the March 2019 EEB installed

#### Issue #2

Proxy server password displayed to administrator.

CVE ID: [CVE-2019-9867](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9867)

Severity: Medium

CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.6 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L))

When using the NetBackup Appliance Web Console, if a proxy server password has been previously configured for use, an administrator can retrieve the password for the account, even if Call Home or the Proxy Server are not currently active. This exposes the full account credentials to the administrator allowing the administrator to access the proxy server for other purposes, e.g. to change the password thus preventing the appliance from using the proxy server.

Note: For NetBackup Appliance 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 “<saved>” is displayed instead of the actual password, however the password can be found in the HTML of the page.

Affected Products

* NetBackup Appliance 3.1.2, 3.1.1, 3.1, 3.0, 2.7.3, and possibly earlier, unsupported versions without the March 2019 EEB installed

### Questions

If you have any questions about any information in this security advisory please contact [Veritas technical support](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US.html).

### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities
