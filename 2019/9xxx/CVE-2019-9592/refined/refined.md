The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities affecting ShoreTel Connect ONSITE versions prior to 19.49.1500.0. Specifically, it describes reflected XSS vulnerabilities and session fixation issues, identified by CVE-2019-9592.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within multiple parameters leading to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure session cookie handling allows for session hijacking after successful XSS exploitation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Reflected XSS in multiple parameters:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled inputs in the `brandUrl` parameter in `/signin.php`, the `url` parameter in `/index.php`, and the `page` parameter in `/site/` which allows injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
2.  **Session Fixation:** Insecure session cookie handling, specifically with the `PHPSESSID` and `chkcookie` cookies, allows an attacker to hijack a user's session.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, allowing attackers to potentially steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect the user to malicious sites.
- **Session Hijacking:** Once a valid session cookie is obtained through XSS, an attacker can hijack the user's session, gaining unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** By crafting malicious URLs containing JavaScript code and tricking users into accessing them, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the user's browser via the vulnerable parameters.
- **Session Hijacking:** Exploiting the XSS vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to steal the user's session cookies. These cookies can then be used to impersonate the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and deliver malicious URLs to the victim. This can be achieved through phishing emails, social engineering, or by injecting malicious links on other websites.
- For session hijacking, the attacker needs to first successfully exploit the XSS vulnerabilities to get the session cookies.

**Affected versions:**
- Specifically tested on versions 18.62.2000.0, 19.45.1602.0, 19.45.5101.0, 19.47.9000.0, 19.48.8400.0, other versions may also be affected.
- Fixed in version 19.49.1500.0
