Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `getopt_simple` shell function, which is presented in the "Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide" as an example of how to process command-line arguments.
- The function uses `eval` to execute the extracted parameters and their values, making it susceptible to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Command Injection:** The `eval` command within the `getopt_simple` function executes arbitrary code provided through the command-line arguments. Specifically, the code extracts the parameter and value from the command line and evaluates them using the shell's `eval` command which executes the string.
- **Insecure Input Handling:** The `getopt_simple` function does not sanitize or validate the input it receives, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting shell commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the script using the vulnerable `getopt_simple` function. This could lead to full system compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the script is run with elevated privileges (e.g., via sudo), the attacker can gain those elevated privileges. This specific case allowed a `www-data` user to run the script `cleanup.sh` as `root`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Command-Line Arguments:** The attack is carried out by crafting malicious command-line arguments passed to a script using the vulnerable `getopt_simple` function.
- An attacker can either inject a shell command in the parameter name, parameter value, or overwrite the `PATH` environment variable to point to attacker controlled executables.
   - Example: `sudo /usr/local/sbin/cleanup.sh '--redteam=foo;id'`
   - Example:  `sudo /usr/local/sbin/cleanup.sh '--target=$(id)'`
   - Example: `sudo /usr/local/sbin/cleanup.sh --PATH=/tmp/redteam`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Execute Script:** The attacker needs the ability to execute a script that uses the vulnerable `getopt_simple` function.
- **Ability to Control Arguments:** The attacker needs to be able to control the command-line arguments passed to the script.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory from RedTeam Pentesting provides a clear explanation of how the vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test.
- The advisory notes that the "Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide" is a widely used resource for learning shell scripting, and it contains an insecure implementation.
- The advisory also provides a clear fix for the issue which recommends the use of the `getopts` built-in, or `getopt` from the util-linux package.
- The author of the guide was notified but indicated that the document is not actively maintained or updated.
