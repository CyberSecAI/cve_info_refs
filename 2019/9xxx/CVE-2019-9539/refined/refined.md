The provided content is related to CVE-2019-9539.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Telos Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) prior to version 4.1.5.5 contains multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and access control mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- A database information disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, the system fails to properly restrict access to information about other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into an AMHS session by crafting a special URI.
- An attacker can access information about other AMHS users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting a special AMHS URI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URI that will be processed by the vulnerable AMHS system.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or a privileged position to exploit the XSS vulnerability.
- The attacker might not require prior authentication to perform information disclosure.
