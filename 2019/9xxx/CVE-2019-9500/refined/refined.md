{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `brcmf_wowl_nd_results` function in the `brcmfmac` driver copies the SSID from a received event frame without proper length validation, leading to a heap buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow due to missing bounds check on SSID length from a received firmware event frame."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution on the host system. This can occur either through a compromised chipset or by exploiting a frame validation bypass and sending crafted frames remotely.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting and sending a malicious event frame with an overly long SSID in the data field.",
        "Remote exploitation is possible by combining this vulnerability with a separate frame validation bypass (CVE-2019-9503)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted WiFi packets to a vulnerable system. If used in combination with a frame validation bypass, this can be exploited remotely by an attacker able to reach the vulnerable device."
