    "description": "Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Chun-Min Chang, Aral Yaman, Andreea Pavel, Jonathan Kew, Gary Kwong, Alex Gaynor, Masayuki Nakano, and Anne van Kesteren reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 65, Firefox ESR 60.5, and Thunderbird 60.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
