Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the Darktrace Enterprise Immune System's web interface, specifically affecting the `/config` endpoint. This allows an attacker to make unauthorized changes to the system configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the absence of adequate CSRF protection mechanisms for the `/config` endpoint. This allows an attacker to craft malicious web pages that, when loaded by an authenticated user, can send requests to the vulnerable Darktrace device, without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Configuration Changes:**  An attacker can modify critical Darktrace configurations, potentially disabling security features such as alerting and the Antigena component.
- **Whitelisting Malicious Domains:** An attacker can whitelist malicious domains, potentially allowing malicious traffic to bypass security checks.
- **Disabling Security Features:** An attacker can disable various alerts and the Antigena component, making the system vulnerable to attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector is a malicious web page or link that the user is tricked into loading, which triggers the crafted CSRF requests.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to employ social engineering tactics to convince the victim to load the malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Victim's Browser:** The attacker needs a way to make the target user open a malicious web page while they are authenticated to the Darktrace system. This could be through email, phishing, malicious advertisements, or similar social engineering techniques.
- **Knowledge of Darktrace Instance:** The attacker needs to know the IP address or domain of the target Darktrace appliance to properly construct the malicious form.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) HTML code shows how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability. It uses a hidden form to send a POST request to the Darktrace device's `/config` endpoint. Specifically, this PoC:
  - Disables the Antigena Network component (`AntigenaNetwork` = `false`).
  - Disables various alerts (HTTPAlerts, ActiveMQAlerts, etc.).
  - It also shows how to whitelist a malicious domain (`www.evilhackers.com`) using a separate form that submits to `/whitelisteddomains`, demonstrating CVE-2019-9596 as well.
The PoC uses javascript and hidden forms to submit these configurations changes to the Darktrace device.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was confirmed in Darktrace Enterprise Immune System versions 3.0.9 and 3.0.10.
- The vendor released version 3.1 to mitigate this issue by adding SameSite lax cookie support, and also corrected the GET request CSRF vulnerability by implementing a strict mode for the SameSite cookie.
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability using a web page hosted on a different domain, as long as the victim is logged into Darktrace in the same browser.
- The initial fix by Darktrace was not complete, as GET requests were still vulnerable and older browsers didn't fully support SameSite.
- The provided link leads to a video demonstrating the exploit.
