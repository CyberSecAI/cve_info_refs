    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Type confusion occurs when manipulating JavaScript objects in object groups, specifically when an object's ObjectGroup unexpectedly changes after being converted from an UnboxedObject to a NativeObject due to property deletion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Type confusion vulnerability in the JavaScript engine's IonMonkey JIT compiler.",
        "Incomplete checks within `ObjectGroupDispatch` operation allowing for unexpected ObjectGroups to bypass security checks."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability allows bypassing security checks within object groups. This can lead to type confusion, potentially allowing execution of unsafe code, and possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered through crafted JavaScript code that manipulates objects in object groups.",
        "Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by allocating an object with an unboxed layout, converting it back to a native object (via property deletion), which changes its ObjectGroup, and then calling methods which use ObjectGroupDispatch that has no fallback for the changed ObjectGroup."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code in the context of a vulnerable browser or JavaScript environment. This could be achieved through malicious websites or other means of running JavaScript code.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability was demonstrated using `UnboxedObjects`, which are disabled by default. The vulnerability involves the `ObjectGroupDispatch` operation, which is used for optimizing method calls in JavaScript. When an object's ObjectGroup unexpectedly changes (e.g., after being converted from an unboxed object to a native object), the `ObjectGroupDispatch` operation can jump to an incorrect implementation of a method or omit important security checks. The fix involves adding checks in the `ObjectGroupDispatch` to assert if the object's group has changed unexpectedly, causing a crash to prevent arbitrary code execution in non-debug builds. The provided information also includes details about code commits, security approval requests, and discussions about backporting the fix to different versions of Firefox."
