RELATED: CVE-2019-9913

Vulnerability: Reflected XSS
Affected Software: WP Live Chat Support WordPress plugin
Affected Version: 8.0.17
Patched Version: 8.0.18
Risk: Medium
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

Root cause: The WP Live Chat Support WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS as it echoes the term parameter without proper encoding.

Attack vector: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in the "term" parameter.

Impact: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the application, potentially leading to:
- Bypassing CSRF protection
- Performing actions on behalf of the user
- Accessing data accessible to the user

Vulnerable code: The vulnerability exists in the gdpr.php module where the "term" parameter is echoed without proper encoding in the href attribute of the <a> tag.

Additionally, a self-XSS issue exists in the client-side input form, which can be triggered by entering `'"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`.
