Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9803:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content from `www.mozilla.org` explicitly mentions `CVE-2019-9803` and its description aligns with the provided bugzilla entries, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` (UIR) mechanism, implemented via Content Security Policy (CSP), wasn't correctly enforced for same-origin navigations.
   - When UIR is enabled, navigations to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. However, Firefox was incorrectly navigating to HTTP URLs in some cases instead of enforcing the upgrade,

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Incorrect enforcement of the UIR policy for same-origin navigations.
   - A potential bypass of the security mechanism that is intended to prevent loading resources over insecure connections.
   - Failure to properly enforce the upgrade to HTTPS as mandated by the CSP directive.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   -  Potential for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept and potentially modify traffic between the browser and the server.
   -  Users might be exposed to insecure resources even when the website intends to use HTTPS.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - An attacker could perform a MITM attack by exploiting the lack of HTTPS upgrade for same-origin navigation.
   - If a website uses UIR to enforce HTTPS but the browser fails to upgrade same-origin navigation, this could expose the user to attacks.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be positioned in a network to perform MITM attacks, intercepting network traffic.
   - The attacker does not need to compromise the server or the website itself.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Bugzilla Context:** The provided bugzilla content ([Bug 1437009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437009))  indicates that the issue stems from the CSP not being correctly propagated to the TriggeringPrincipal in cases of right-click new tab, ctrl-click new tab, and drag & drop new tab actions.
*   **Fix:** The bug was marked as a duplicate of [Bug 1515863](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515863), implying that fix for 1515863 also addressed this vulnerability.
*   **Affected versions:** The vulnerability is associated with Firefox versions prior to version 66, where the fix was implemented.

In summary, CVE-2019-9803 describes a flaw in Firefox where the `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` policy was not correctly enforced for same-origin navigations, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks. This vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 66 and later versions.
