As part of a code review I am conducting for Paul Theriault against the sandbox, the following vulnerability has been discovered.
A compromised content process can initiate an FTP file download which will in turn generate a mozilla::net::PFTPChannelChild object to handle downloading the files contents for rendering in the content process. If the MIME type is not supported for rendering in the content process, the file will be passed over to the Chrome process so the user may elect to either open or download the file.
When the file is to be passed over to the Chrome process, the child content process will call FTPChannelParent::RecvDivertOnDataAvailable in the parent chrome process via the PFTPChannel IPDL protocol. The child may supply a length value which is greater than the total size of the file to be downloaded via the 'count' parameter.
> mozilla::ipc::IPCResult
> FTPChannelParent::RecvDivertOnDataAvailable(const nsCString& data, // <-- a byte buffer holding the files contents.
> const uint64\_t& offset,
> const uint32\_t& count) // <-- attacker can supply a count value greater than the size of the above data buffer.
> {
> if (NS\_WARN\_IF(!mDivertingFromChild)) {
> MOZ\_ASSERT(mDivertingFromChild,
> "Cannot RecvDivertOnDataAvailable if diverting is not set!");
> FailDiversion(NS\_ERROR\_UNEXPECTED);
> return IPC\_FAIL\_NO\_REASON(this);
> }
>
> // Drop OnDataAvailables if the parent was canceled already.
> if (NS\_FAILED(mStatus)) {
> return IPC\_OK();
> }
>
> mEventQ->RunOrEnqueue(new FTPDivertDataAvailableEvent(this, data, offset,
> count));
> return IPC\_OK();
> }
The FTPDivertDataAvailableEvent event will in turn call FTPChannelParent::DivertOnDataAvailable which will create an new nsIInputStream to represent the data buffer to process. This stream can have an arbitrary length value supplied by the attacker. If the length value is greater than the data buffer supplied by the attacker, then the adjacent contents of memory can be read from when OnDataAvailable processes the stream.

Firefox's default action is to present the user with a dialog to either open or save the file. However in the background the contents of the file will be downloaded to a temp directory with no user interaction required. For example on a Win10 machine I get a file like "C:\Users\stephen\AppData\Local\Temp\qfamDcQE.zip.part". This location will obviously be different across OS platforms which may effect how easily an attacker can read it back depending on the sandbox implementation for that OS.
If an attacker can read this files contents -
\* They would need read permission explicitly for this file and then either discover or brute force the 'qfamDcQE' part of the file name.
\* They would need read permissions on the temp directory. Then discovering the file name to read should be trivial as directory enumeration API access should be allowed (e.g FindFirstfile/FindNextFile on Windows).
The attacker can now leak out memory from the Chrome process. This could be leveraged by an attacker to either bypass ASLR for an additional memory corruption based sandbox escape exploit, or to try and leak out sensitive contents from the Chrome process (Perhaps session keys or similar).
To reproduce this issue:
\* Visit ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/ in a content process.
\* Optional: Run a tool like procmon.exe to monitor firefox.exe file access if you want to see the .zip.part file being written.
\* Attach WinDbg to this content process.
\* Break into WinDbg and set a breakpoint via the command "bp xul!mozilla::net::PFTPChannelChild::SendDivertOnDataAvailable". Now continue execution of the process.
\* Click a file to download, for example ftp://speedtest.tele2.net/1KB.zip which is 1024 (0x400) bytes in size.
\* WinDbg will break in SendDivertOnDataAvailable. We now simulate a compromised content process. Using the WinDbg Locals window, edit the count value from 0x400 to something larger like 0x1400. Now press F5 to continue execution.
\* Firefox will display a save/open dialog, you can ignore this.
\* The "XXXXXXXX.zip.part" file will automatically be written to disk in the background by the Chrome process. It will be written to your AppData\Local\Temp\ directory. Inspecting this file will show the file size is 0x1400 and at offset 0x400 (the original file size) are 0x1000 bytes of the Chrome processes memory which was adjacent to the original data buffer from the original FTPChannelParent::RecvDivertOnDataAvailable call.
\* Note: There is a chance the Chrome process will read into unallocated memory and access violate. The attacker would need to perform some form of heap massaging in order to influence the layout of the heap and ensure this doesn't happen and that they leak some thing interesting.

cropping |count| as min(count, data.Length()) is the solution here.Priority: -- → P3Whiteboard: [necko-triaged]

Should the |min| call be done there, or when we |SendDivertOnDataAvailable| (or maybe even before then)? I'm not familiar with this code enough to say for certain which makes sense.

Paul, I think this patch also fixes [bug 1505678](/show_bug.cgi?id=1505678 "RESOLVED FIXED - ExternalHelperAppParent doesn't validate arguments (potential sandbox issue)"). On that bug you suggest there are other unsafe callsites, can you verify this patch fixes all of them?

The query I ran was something like "find all the places we recieve a nsCString arg in the parent which has a name which contains the substring "data". That yeilds this list:

RecvSetCustomCursor aCursorData [TabParent.cpp#1748](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/ipc/TabParent.cpp#1748) - original bug, fixed.

RecvOnDataAvailable data [PSMContentListener.cpp#232](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/manager/ssl/PSMContentListener.cpp#232) - just calls data.append() so i think its ok?

RecvDivertOnDataAvailable data [FTPChannelParent.cpp#272](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/ftp/FTPChannelParent.cpp#272) - this bug

RecvWriteData data [AltDataOutputStreamParent.cpp#30](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/AltDataOutputStreamParent.cpp#30) - mOutputStream->Write(... data.Length() so I think this is safe?

RecvDivertOnDataAvailable data [HttpChannelParent.cpp#1118](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/HttpChannelParent.cpp#1118) - fixed by your patch

RecvOnDataAvailable data [ExternalHelperAppParent.cpp#15](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/uriloader/exthandler/ExternalHelperAppParent.cpp#156) - fixed by your patch

So I think you got all the cases. I'm leaving the need-info for me to remind me to look at this issue more broadly (ie without the filter on "data" but you got all the specific cases I had).

I'm not sure if we want this on ESR60 or not (I'm inclined towards no unless there's a strong reason for doing so), but this at least grafts cleanly to Beta if we want it there.

Is this something you would like to uplift? We are kind of late in beta but if you would like, we can give it a try.

## 1. Introduction

*This section is not normative.*

Increasingly, we encourage authors to transition their sites and applications
away from insecure transport, and onto encrypted and authenticated connections [[WEB-HTTPS]](#biblio-web-https). While this migration has significant advantages for both
authors and users, it isn’t without negative side-effects.

Most notably, mixed content checking [[MIX]](#biblio-mix) has the potential to cause real
headache for administrators tasked with moving substantial amounts of legacy
content onto HTTPS. In particular, going through old content and rewriting
resource URLs manually is a huge undertaking. Moreover, it’s often the case
that truly legacy content is difficult or impossible to update. Consider the
BBC’s archived websites [[BBC-ARCHIVE]](#biblio-bbc-archive), or the New York Times' hard-coded
URLs [[NYT-HTTPS]](#biblio-nyt-https).

We should remove this burden from site authors by allowing them to assert to a
user agent that they intend a site to load only secure resources, and that
insecure URLs ought to be treated as though they had been replaced with equivalent secure
URLs.

This document defines a new Content Security Policy directive, `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)`, through which authors can make
this assertion.
Note: Delivering the policy as a header allows an administrator to easily
opt a set of pages into the upgrade mechanism without touching their source
code individually. The legacy content examples above would not be feasible
with an approach that inlined the policy into HTML, for example.

### 1.1. Goals

The overarching goal is to reduce the burden of migrating websites from
insecure origins by reducing the negative side effects of mixed content
blocking [[MIX]](#biblio-mix).

If we assume that authors do the server-side legwork (obtaining a certificate,
configuring the server, setting up redirects), and that authors also ensure
that both first- and third-party content is accessible at *the same [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) and [path](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-path)* on a secure [scheme](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-scheme), then the
following statements ought to hold after implementing this feature:

1. Authors should be able to ensure that all content requested by a given
   page loads successfully, and securely. Mixed content blocking should not
   break pages as a result of migrating to a secure origin.

   Note: This requirement is *not* met by Mixed Content’s [strict
   mode](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#strict-mode), which makes something like the opposite assertion.

   - As a result of #1, the user agent should not degrade any security
     indicators related to requesting mixed content, as no insecure content
     should be requested.- Authors should be able to ensure that all internal links correctly send
       users to the site’s secure address, and not to its pre-migration insecure
       address.- Authors should be able to achieve all these goals without editing a site’s
         content. This is particularly important for archived content and legacy
         systems for which maintenance is difficult enough, never mind upgrades.- Authors should be able to pursue a gradual transition from insecure to
           secure, serving secure resources to clients that support upgrades, while
           retaining insecure resources for clients that don’t.

Note: The mechanism defined here does *not* intend to supplant Strict
Transport Security [[RFC6797]](#biblio-rfc6797). See [§ 7.2 Relation to HSTS](#relation-to-hsts) for details.

### 1.2. Examples

#### 1.2.1. Non-navigational Upgrades

 Megacorp, Inc. wishes to migrate `http://example.com/` to `https://example.com`. They set up their servers
to make their own resources available over HTTPS, and work with partners in
order to make third-party widgets available securely as well.

They quickly realize, however, that the majority of their content is locked
up in a database tied to an old content management system, and it contains
hardcoded links to insecure resources (e.g., http:// URLs to images and
other content). Unfortunately, it’s a substantial amount of work to update
it.

As a stopgap measure, Megacorp injects the following header field into every
HTML response that goes out from their servers:

```
[Content-Security-Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy): [upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)

```

This automatically upgrades all insecure resource requests from their pages
to secure variants, allowing a user agent to treat the following HTML code:

```
<img src="http://example.com/image.png">
<img src="http://not-example.com/image.png">

```

as though it had been delivered as:

```
<img src="https://example.com/image.png">
<img src="https://not-example.com/image.png">

```

The URL will be rewritten before the request is made, meaning that no
insecure requests will hit the network. Users will be safer, and Megacorp’s
administrators will be happier, as all resource requests will be
transparently upgraded with no effort on their part.

#### 1.2.2. Navigational Upgrades

 Megacorp, Inc. isn’t quite ready to deliver Strict Transport Security
headers [[RFC6797]](#biblio-rfc6797), but does want to keep users on secure pages when
possible. Happily, this comes for free with `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)`. That is, they’re already
delivering pages with the following header:
```
[Content-Security-Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy): [upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)

```

This allows user agents to treat the following HTML code:

```
<a href="http://example.com/">Home</a>

```

as though it had been delivered as:

```
<a href="https://example.com/">Home</a>

```

Links to third-party sites will not be upgraded. That is, the following
HTML code:

```
<a href="http://not-example.com/">Home</a>

```

won’t be upgraded.

#### 1.2.3. Failed Upgrade

 Tinycorp, Inc. enabled `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` a bit
earlier than they should have, as they don’t actually support HTTPS on `http://cdn.example.com/`. Given the following code:
```
<img src="http://cdn.example.com/image.png">

```

User agents will upgrade requests, as described in [§ 1.2.1 Non-navigational Upgrades](#example-nonnavigational),
rewriting the URL as `https://cdn.example.com/image.png`. As the
server doesn’t respond to secure requests, this results in a network error.

There is no fallback in this scenario: the user agent acts just as though
the request had been intentionally made, and the request fails.

### 1.3. Recommendations

We recommend that authors who wish to ensure that user agents which support [upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests) are as secure as possible do the following:

1. Redirect insecure, [safely upgradable requests](#safely-upgradable-requests) from HTTP to HTTPS by
   responding with a `Location` header and a `307` status code.
    In Nginx, this kind of redirection might look like this:
   ```
   server {
     if ($http_upgrade_insecure_requests = "1") {
       add_header Vary Upgrade-Insecure-Requests;
       return 307 https://$host$request_uri;
     }
   }

   ```

   This is, of course, greatly simplified; your configuration will likely
   be significantly more complex.

   - Respond to [potentially trustworthy URL](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#potentially-trustworthy-url) [safely
     upgradable requests](#safely-upgradable-requests) with a `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive if necessary for the resource being requested.
      In Nginx, adding this directive might look like this:
     ```
     server {
       ...

       add_header [Content-Security-Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy) [upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests);

       ...
     }

     ```

     This is, of course, greatly simplified; your configuration will likely
     be significantly more complex.

     - If the origin is [HSTS-safe](#hsts-safe-origin), then protect
       against SSL-stripping man-in-the-middle attacks by sending a `[Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1)` header with the `preload` directive, and ensure that insecure content is
       never loaded by enabling Mixed Content’s [strict mode](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#strict-mode).
        In Nginx, adding this header might look like this (note the use of
       the `preloaded` directive, which signifies that this
       origin’s HSTS state can be safely imported into user agents' HSTS
       preload lists):
       ```
       server {
         ...

         add_header [Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1) "max-age=10886400; preload"
         add_header [Content-Security-Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy) [block-all-mixed-content](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#block-all-mixed-content);

         ...
       }

       ```

       This is, of course, greatly simplified; your configuration will likely
       be significantly more complex.

       Additionally, work with user agent vendors to add the origin to
       HSTS Preload Lists (for example, by submitting the origin to [hstspreload.appspot.com](https://hstspreload.appspot.com/)).

       - If the origin is [conditionally HSTS-safe](#conditionally-hsts-safe-origin), then opt-into HSTS only
         in response to [safely upgradable requests](#safely-upgradable-requests).
          In Nginx, adding this header conditionally might look like this (note
         the use of `map`, as setting headers inside `if` without returning immediately is, well, iffy):
         ```
         server {
           ...

           map $http_https $sts {
             "1" "max-age=10886400"
           }

           add_header [Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1) $sts;

           ...
         }

         ```

         This is, of course, greatly simplified; your configuration will likely
         be significantly more complex.

## 2. Key Concepts and Terminology

upgrade

A [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request) is said to be **upgraded** if it is rewritten
to contain a URL with a [scheme](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-scheme) of `https` or `wss`.

safely upgradable requests

A [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request) is said to be **safely upgradable** if the [resource representation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3) which will be returned does not require the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` mechanism described in this
document to avoid breakage, or if the [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request)'s [header list](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-header-list) contains an [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) with a value of `1`.

HSTS-safe origin

An [origin](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2) is said to be **HSTS-safe** if no [resource representations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3) it returns requires the the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` mechanism described in
this document to avoid breakage, and if all [resource representations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3) it returns can be served over HTTPS.

[HSTS-safe origins](#hsts-safe-origin) can safely opt-into `[Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1)` for all user agents,
without risking broken pages for user agents which do not support `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)`.

conditionally HSTS-safe origin

An [origin](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2) is said to be **conditionally HSTS-safe** if one or more [resource representations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3) it returns requires the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` mechanism described in
this document to avoid breakage, and if all [resource representations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3) it
returns can be served over HTTPS.

[Conditionally HSTS-safe origins](#conditionally-hsts-safe-origin) can safely opt-into `[Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1)` only for user agents which
support `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)`.

preloadable HSTS host

A [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) host is a **preloadable HSTS
host** if, when performing [Known HSTS Host Domain Name
Matching](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.2), host is a [superdomain match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.2) for a [Known HSTS Host](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.1.1) which asserts both the [includeSubDomains](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.2) directive and the `preload` directive, or host is a [congruent match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.2)for a [Known HSTS Host](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-8.1.1) which asserts
the `preload` directive.

Note: This is a long way of saying "any host the user agent has pinned
with a `[Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1)` header that contained
a `preload` directive".

The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation used in [§ 3.1 The upgrade-insecure-requests Content Security Policy directive](#delivery) is
specified in RFC5234. [[ABNF]](#biblio-abnf)

## 3. Upgrading Insecure Resource Requests

In order to allow authors to mitigate the negative side-effects of migration
away from insecure origins, authors may instruct the user agent to
transparently upgrade resource requests to [potentially trustworthy URL](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#potentially-trustworthy-url) variants of the original request’s URL.

To support this instruction:

1. [Environment settings objects](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#environment-settings-object) and [browsing contexts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsing-context) are
   given an insecure requests policy which has two
   potential values Do Not
   Upgrade and Upgrade. It is
   set to [Do Not Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-do-not-upgrade) unless otherwise specified. This policy
   is checked in [§ 4.1 Upgrade request to a potentially trustworthy URL, if appropriate](#upgrade-request) in order to determine whether or not
   non-navigation requests and form submissions should be upgraded during [fetching](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch).- [Environment settings objects](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#environment-settings-object) and [browsing contexts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsing-context) are
     given an upgrade insecure navigations set which
     contains a set of ([host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host), [port](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-port)) tuples to which navigations
     ought to be upgraded. Its value is the empty set unless otherwise
     specified. This set is checked in [§ 4.1 Upgrade request to a potentially trustworthy URL, if appropriate](#upgrade-request) in order to
     determine whether or not [navigation requests](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request) should be upgraded.

### 3.1. The `upgrade-insecure-requests` Content Security Policy directive

**✔**MDN

[Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests "The HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) upgrade-insecure-requests directive instructs user agents to treat all of a site's insecure URLs (those served over HTTP) as though they have been replaced with secure URLs (those served over HTTPS). This directive is intended for web sites with large numbers of insecure legacy URLs that need to be rewritten.")

In all current engines.

A server MAY instruct a user agent to upgrade insecure requests for a
particular [protected resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#protected-resource) by sending a `[Content-Security-Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy)` header [[CSP]](#biblio-csp) that contains a upgrade-insecure-requests directive, defined via the
following ABNF grammar:

```
directive-name  = "upgrade-insecure-requests"
directive-value = ""

```

When [enforcing](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#enforce) the `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive:

1. Let settings be the [protected resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#protected-resource)’s [incumbent
   settings object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#incumbent-settings-object).- Set settings’s [insecure requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) to [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade).- Let tuple be a tuple of the [protected resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#protected-resource)’s [URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url)'s [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) and [port](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-port).- Insert tuple into settings’s [upgrade insecure
         navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set).

[Monitoring](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#monitor) the `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive has
no effect: the directive is ignored when sent via a `[Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy-report-only)` header. Authors can
determine whether or not upgraded resources' original URLs
were insecure via `[Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy-report-only)`. For
example, `[Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy-report-only):
default-src https:; report-uri /endpoint`. See [§ 3.4 Reporting Upgrades](#reporting-upgrades) for additional detail.

#### 3.1.1. Relation to "Mixed Content"

The `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive results in
requests being rewritten at the top of the [Fetching](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch) algorithm [[FETCH]](#biblio-fetch), as specified in [§ 4.1 Upgrade request to a potentially trustworthy URL, if appropriate](#upgrade-request). It’s important to note that
the rewrite happens *before* either Mixed Content [[MIX]](#biblio-mix) or Content
Security Policy checks take effect [[CSP]](#biblio-csp).

This ordering means that upgraded requests *will not* be flagged as
mixed content. Moreover, it means that `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)`’s effect takes place before
the `[block-all-mixed-content](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/#block-all-mixed-content)` directive would have a chance
to block the request. If the former is set, the latter is effectively a no-op.

We recommend that authors set one directive or the other, as outlined in [§ 1.3 Recommendations](#recommendations).

### 3.2. Feature Detecting Clients Capable of Upgrading

Sites which require the upgrade mechanism laid out in this document in order
to provide users with a reasonable experience over secure transit need some
way to determine whether or not a particular [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request) can safely be
redirected from HTTP to HTTPS (and vice-versa). Moreover, [conditionally
HSTS-safe origins](#conditionally-hsts-safe-origin) can only opt-into `[Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1)` for supported user agents, and
doing otherwise could have negative consequences for the site’s users.

Rather than relying on user-agent sniffing to make this decision, user agents
can advertise their upgrade capability when making [navigation requests](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request) by including an [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) as
described in [§ 3.2.1 The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests HTTP Request Header Field](#preference).

#### 3.2.1. The `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` HTTP Request Header Field

**✔**MDN

[Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests "The HTTP Upgrade-Insecure-Requests request header sends a signal to the server expressing the client's preference for an encrypted and authenticated response, and that it can successfully handle the upgrade-insecure-requests CSP directive.")

In all current engines.

Firefox48+Safari10.1+Chrome44+

---

Opera?Edge79+

---

Edge (Legacy)17+IENone

---

Firefox for Android?iOS Safari?Chrome for Android?Android WebView?Samsung Internet?Opera Mobile?

The  `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` HTTP request header
field sends a signal to the server expressing the client’s preference
for an encrypted and authenticated response, and that it can successfully
handle the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive in order
to make that preference as seamless as possible to provide.

This preference is represented by the following ANBF:

```
"Upgrade-Insecure-Requests:" *[WSP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1) "1" *[WSP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1)

```

Note: Though the `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header expresses a
preference, sending it via the existing `[Prefer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240#section-2)` header is
problematic, as we expect the response from the server to use it as part of
the cache key. `Vary: Prefer` is too broad, as discussed in [w3/webappsec#216](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/issues/216).

User agent conformance details are described in step #1 of the the [§ 4.1 Upgrade request to a potentially trustworthy URL, if appropriate](#upgrade-request) algorithm. That step represents the following
requirements:

1. User agents MUST send an [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header
   field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) along with [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request)s for insecure URLs.

   Note: Servers can use this signal to upgrade HTTP requests to HTTPS for
   pages that require `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` support.

   - User agents MUST send an [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header
     field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) along with [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request)s for [potentially trustworthy URLs](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#potentially-trustworthy-url) whose [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url)'s [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) is *not* a [preloadable HSTS host](#preloadable-hsts-host).

     Note: Servers can use the absence of this signal to downgrade HTTPS
     requests to HTTP for pages that require `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` support.

     - User agents SHOULD periodically send an [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) along with [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request)s for [potentially trustworthy URLs](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#potentially-trustworthy-url) whose [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url)'s [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) *is* a [preloadable HSTS host](#preloadable-hsts-host). For example, user agents could send an [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) only when
       the asserted `max-age` is a few days from expiration, or
       only for a small percentage of requests.

       Note: [preloadable HSTS hosts](#preloadable-hsts-host) have asserted that they are [HSTS-safe](#hsts-safe-origin), and therefore don’t need a downgrade signal. They will
       need to refresh HSTS status before the asserted `max-age` expires, and the [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header
       field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) serves as a fine signal that HSTS could be refreshed.

When a server encounters this preference in an HTTP request’s headers, it
SHOULD redirect the user to a [potentially trustworthy URL](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#potentially-trustworthy-url) variant
of the resource being requested.

When a server encounters this preference in an HTTPS request’s headers,
it SHOULD include a `[Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1)` header in
the response if the request’s [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) is [HSTS-safe](#hsts-safe-origin) or [conditionally HSTS-safe](#conditionally-hsts-safe-origin) [[RFC6797]](#biblio-rfc6797).

 A client that supports this document’s upgrade mechanism requests `http://example.com/` as follows:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
[Upgrade-Insecure-Requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field): 1

```

The server parses the preference, notices that the user’s client can deal
well with upgrade requests, and therefore responds to the request by
redirecting the user to a secure version of the resource she’s requesting:

```
HTTP/1.1 307 Moved Temporarily
Location: https://example.com/
[Vary](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4): [Upgrade-Insecure-Requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field)

```

The [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) is listed in the [`Vary`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4) header, as the
redirect response might otherwise be served by caches to clients that
don’t support the upgrade mechanism defined here. A similar effect could be
achieved by making this redirect response uncachable via the [`Cache-Control`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2) header:

```
HTTP/1.1 307 Moved Temporarily
Location: https://example.com/
[Cache-Control](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2): [no-store](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.2.3)

```
### 3.3. Policy Inheritance

If a `[Document](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-document)`'s [incumbent settings object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#incumbent-settings-object)’s [insecure requests
policy](#insecure-requests-policy) is set to [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade), the user agent MUST ensure that
all [nested browsing contexts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#nested-browsing-context) inherit the setting in the following ways:

1. When a [nested browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#nested-browsing-context) context is created:
   1. If context’s [embedding document](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-mixed-content/#embedding-document)’s [insecure
      requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) is [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade), then:
      1. Set context’s [insecure requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) to [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade).- For each value in context’s [embedding
           document](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-mixed-content/#embedding-document)’s [upgrade insecure navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set), add value to context’s [upgrade insecure
           navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set).- When [creating a new `Document` object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#create-a-document-object) document in a [browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsing-context) context:
     1. If context’s [insecure requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) is [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade), then:
        1. Let settings be document’s [incumbent
           settings object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#incumbent-settings-object).- Set settings’ [insecure requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) to [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade).- For each value in context’s [upgrade
               insecure navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set), add value to settings’s [upgrade insecure navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set).

Likewise, when spinning up a worker, the user agent MUST ensure that it
inherits the setting from the context that created it in the following ways:

1. When executing the [set up a worker environment settings object](http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#script-settings-for-workers) algorithm, perform the following steps after the current step #4:
   5. If inherited responsible browsing context’s [insecure
      requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) is [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade), then:
      1. Set settings object’s [insecure requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) to [Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-upgrade).- For each value in inherited responsible browsing
           context’s [upgrade insecure navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set), add value to settings object’s [upgrade
           insecure navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set).

### 3.4. Reporting Upgrades

Upgrading insecure requests MUST not interfere with an authors' ability to
track down requests that would be insecure in a user agent that does not
support upgrades. To that end, upgrades MUST be performed *after* evaluating request against all [monitored](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#monitor) security policies,
but *before* evaluating request against all [enforced](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#enforce) policies.

 Within the context of a [protected resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#protected-resource) which contains the
insecure image `<img src="http://example.com/image.png">`,
and delivers the following HTTP headers:
```
[Content-Security-Policy](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy): [upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests); [default-src](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#default-src) https:
[Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#content-security-policy-report-only): [default-src](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#default-src) https:; [report-uri](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#report-uri) /endpoint

```

The user agent will fire off a [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request) request that:

1. Violates the policy being [monitored](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#monitor), thereby delivering a [violation report](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#example-violation-report) to `/endpoint`.- Is upgraded from `http://example.com/image.png` to `https://example.com/image.png`.- Does not violate the policy being [enforced](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#enforce).

Note: This will be significantly clarified once [[CSP]](#biblio-csp) is rewritten in terms
of [[FETCH]](#biblio-fetch).

## 4. Processing Algorithms

### 4.1. Upgrade request to a [potentially trustworthy URL](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#potentially-trustworthy-url), if appropriate

Given a [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request) request, this algorithm will rewrite its [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url) if the [client](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-client) from which the request originates
has opted-in to upgrades. It will also inject an [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) header for
insecure [navigation requests](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request) in order to improve a server’s ability to
feature-detect a client’s upgrade capabilities.

We will not upgrade cross-origin [navigation requests](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request), with the
exception of form submissions. Form submissions will be upgraded to mitigate
the risk of data leakage via plaintext submissions.

Note: This algorithm is called at the top of the [Main Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#main-fetch) algorithm.

1. If request is a [navigation request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request), [append](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-header-list-append) a
   header named `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` with a value of `1` to request’s [header list](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-header-list) if any of the following
   criteria are met:
   1. request’s [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url) is not a [potentially trustworthy URL](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/#potentially-trustworthy-url)- request’s [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url)'s [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) is *not* a [preloadable HSTS host](#preloadable-hsts-host)

   Note: User agents can choose to append the [`Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` header field](#upgrade-insecure-requests-http-request-header-field) for other
   requests, as discussed in [§ 3.2.1 The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests HTTP Request Header Field](#preference).

   - If request is a [navigation request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request), then:
     1. If request is a form submission, skip the remaining
        substeps, and continue upgrading request.- If request’s [client](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-client)'s [target browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#concept-environment-target-browsing-context) is a [nested browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#nested-browsing-context), skip the remaining substeps
          and continue upgrading request.- Let tuple be a tuple of request’s [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url)'s [host](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-host) and [port](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-port).- If tuple is contained in [client](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-client)'s [upgrade insecure navigations set](#upgrade-insecure-navigations-set), then skip the remaining
              substeps, and continue upgrading request.- Return without further modifying request.

     Note: We only upgrade top-level [navigation requests](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request) for hosts
     that have explicitly opted-into the behavior for a particular [protected resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#protected-resource), as described in [§ 1.2 Examples](#examples). Performing
     upgrades for top-level navigations to third-party resources brings a
     significantly higher potential for breakage, so we’re avoiding it for
     the moment. Nested navigations (via `[iframe](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#the-iframe-element)`, for example) affect
     the security status of their embedder, so we ensure that they are
     upgraded if necessary.

     - Let upgrade state be the result of executing [§ 4.2 Should insecure requests be upgraded for client?](#should-upgrade-for-client) upon request’s [client](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-client).- If upgrade state is [Do Not Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-do-not-upgrade), return without
         modifying request.- If request’s [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url)'s [scheme](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-scheme) is
           "`http`", set request’s [URL](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-url)'s [scheme](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-scheme) to "`https`", and return.

Note: Due to [[FETCH]](#biblio-fetch)'s recursive nature, this algorithm will upgrade
insecurely-redirected requests as well as insecure initial requests.

### 4.2. Should insecure [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request)s be upgraded for client?

Given an [request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request)'s [client](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-client) client (an [environment settings object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#environment-settings-object)), this algorithm
returns `Enforced Upgrade` if insecure requests associated with
that client should be upgraded, or [Do Not Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-do-not-upgrade) otherwise. In
short, this will check the client and return the appropriate [insecure
requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy) set on it or its [browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsing-context).

1. If client has a [responsible document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#responsible-document), return the value
   of its [insecure requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy).

   Note: This catches `[Document](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-document)`s or `[Worker](http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#worker)`s whose policy is set
   directly by the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive,
   or which have inherited the policy from an [embedding document](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-mixed-content/#embedding-document).

   - If client has a [responsible browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#responsible-browsing-context), return the
     value of its [insecure requests policy](#insecure-requests-policy).

     Note: This catches requests triggered from detached [client](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-client)s. Not sure this is necessary, really,
     given the inheritance structure defined in [§ 3.3 Policy Inheritance](#nesting).

     - Return [Do Not Upgrade](#valdef-insecure-requests-policy-do-not-upgrade).

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1. Interaction with HSTS

The `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive does not replace
the `[Strict-Transport-Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1)` HTTP response header [[RFC6797]](#biblio-rfc6797). Authors who serve their site over secure transport SHOULD send
that header with an appropriate `max-age` in order to ensure that
users are not subject to SSL stripping attacks by maliciously active network
attackers, or monitoring by maliciously passive network attackers.

### 5.2. CSP Violation Reports

When sending a violation report for an upgraded resource, user agents MUST
target the `[Document](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-document)` or `[Worker](http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#worker)` that triggered the request, rather
than the `[Document](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-document)` or `[Worker](http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#worker)` on which the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive was set. Due to [§ 3.3 Policy Inheritance](#nesting), the latter might be a cross-origin ancestor of the former, and
sending violation reports to that set of reporting endpoints could leak data
in unexpected ways.

Likewise, the `SecurityPolicyViolationEvent` MUST NOT target any `[Document](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#interface-document)` other than the one which triggered the request, for the same
reasons.

## 6. Performance Considerations

The upgrade mechanism specified here adds `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests:
1\r\n` to every outgoing [navigation request](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#navigation-request) to non-[preloadable
HSTS hosts](#preloadable-hsts-host) (as discussed at length on public-webappsec@, and [w3c/webappsec#216](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/issues/216)).
The advantages and intent of the header are laid out in [§ 3.2.1 The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests HTTP Request Header Field](#preference), and
though we’ve taken some steps to ensure that it won’t be a permanent fixture
of the platform (by carving out [preloadable HSTS hosts](#preloadable-hsts-host)), it’s going
to be a long, long time before the header vanishes.

User agents are encouraged to find additional carveouts, and implement them.

## 7. Authoring Considerations

### 7.1. Legacy Clients

Legacy clients which do support mixed content blocking [[MIX]](#biblio-mix), but do not
support the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive will
continue to have a suboptimal experience on pages containing insecure URLs.
Authors SHOULD ensure that they collect [violation reports](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#send-violation-reports) in order to determine
which resources are most problematic for their users, and SHOULD use that
information to prioritize fixes for URLs in legacy content that users will
most likely request.

### 7.2. Relation to HSTS

The mechanism specified here deals only with the security policy for a
specific [protected resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#protected-resource). It does not deprecate, replace, or in any
way reduce the value of the `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP
response header [[RFC6797]](#biblio-rfc6797). Authors can and should continue to use that
header to ensure that their users are not subject to SSL stripping downgrade
attacks, as the `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` directive will
not ensure that users visiting your site via links on third-party sites will
be upgraded to HTTPS for the top-level navigation.

Likewise, the `Strict-Transport-Security` header does not imply
the behavior that `[upgrade-insecure-requests](#upgrade-insecure-requests)` activates.
It only ensures that resources requested from an origin will never hit the
network insecurely.

We are intentionally keeping these concepts distinct, as authors may choose
to activate one or the other behavior, but ought not be forced to bind them
together.

## 8. IANA Considerations

### 8.1. Upgrade-Insecure-Requests Header

The permanent message header field registry should be updated
with the following registration: [[RFC3864]](#biblio-rfc3864)

Header field name
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests
Applicable protocol
http
Status
standard
Author/Change controller
W3C
Specification document
This specification (See [§ 3.2.1 The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests HTTP Request Header Field](#preference))
### 8.2. Upgrade-Insecure-Requests Directive

The Content Security Policy Directive registry should be updated with the
following registration: [[RFC7762]](#biblio-rfc7762)

Directive name
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests
Reference
This specification (See [§ 3.1 The upgrade-insecure-requests Content Security Policy directive](#delivery))

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Build ID: 20180206100151
Steps to reproduce:
1. click the link <https://www.halesworth.net/links/list_two.php?code=3>
2. Find the link in the list with the name "Walpole Chapel".
3. Normal click on the link from [2] will throw "Your connection is not secure" and the page will not be loaded. Because of the "upgrade-insecure-reqeusts" CSP from [1]
4. Opening the link using Right-Click new tab or ctrl-click new tab or drag-and-drop new tab will load the page without any "Your connection is not secure" error.
Actual results:
Summary of actual result:
\* right-click secure link to force top-level navigation
\* the initial load is secure link
\* the requests hits a 30x redirect to navigate to insecure cross-origin page
This is because the CSP is not propagated to the TriggeringPrincipal for these scenarios.
CSP object is null in the below line of code,
<https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#10753>
Expected results:
Expected Result:
Link should be blocked from loading for all these scenarios because of the "upgrade-insecure-reqeusts" CSP.
CSP should be propagated to the Principal for all these scenarios.

The original testcase here doesn't work anymore because the links have been changed in markup. However, I believe this bug was fixed in 66 and later by [bug 1515863](/show_bug.cgi?id=1515863 "VERIFIED FIXED"). Vinoth / Christoph, can you confirm?

(the dupes that use inline JS still open tabs but the JS doesn't run, which seems reasonable behavior)

#### [#CVE-2019-9790: Use-after-free when removing in-use DOM elements](#CVE-2019-9790)

Reporter
Brandon Wieser
Impact
critical
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using JavaScript and the element is then removed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9791: Type inference is incorrect for constructors entered through on-stack replacement with IonMonkey](#CVE-2019-9791)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The type inference system allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9792: IonMonkey leaks JS\_OPTIMIZED\_OUT magic value to script](#CVE-2019-9792)

Reporter
Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero
Impact
critical
##### Description

The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal `JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT` magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9793: Improper bounds checks when Spectre mitigations are disabled](#CVE-2019-9793)

Reporter
Bruno Keith & Niklas Baumstark from the phoenhex team
Impact
high
##### Description

A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect range in circumstances where users have explicitly disabled Spectre mitigations.
 *Note: Spectre mitigations are currently enabled for all users by default settings.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9794: Command line arguments not discarded during execution](#CVE-2019-9794)

Reporter
Joshua Graham
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability was discovered where specific command line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be used to retrieve and execute files whose location is supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI scheme in third party applications and these applications insufficiently sanitize URL data.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9795: Type-confusion in IonMonkey JIT compiler](#CVE-2019-9795)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9796: Use-after-free with SMIL animation controller](#CVE-2019-9796)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected. When a registration is later freed with the removal of the animation controller element, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the driver's observer array.

#### [#CVE-2019-9797: Cross-origin theft of images with createImageBitmap](#CVE-2019-9797)

Reporter
AaylaSecura1138
Impact
high
##### Description

Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the same-origin policy by exporting an image after using `createImageBitmap` to read the image and then rendering the resulting bitmap image within a `canvas` element.

* [Bug 1528909](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528909)

#### [#CVE-2019-9798: Library is loaded from world writable APITRACE\_LIB location](#CVE-2019-9798)

Reporter
Jeff Gilbert
Impact
high
##### Description

On Android systems, Firefox can load a library from `APITRACE_LIB`, which is writable by all users and applications. This could allow malicious third party applications to execute a man-in-the-middle attack if a malicious code was written to that location and loaded.
 *Note: This issue only affects Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9799: Information disclosure via IPC channel messages](#CVE-2019-9799)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
high
##### Description

Insufficient bounds checking of data during inter-process communication might allow a compromised content process to be able to read memory from the parent process under certain conditions.

#### [#CVE-2019-9801: Windows programs that are not 'URL Handlers' are exposed to web content](#CVE-2019-9801)

Reporter
Daniel Veditz
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an external protocol handler and offer to launch this local application when given a matching URL on Windows operating systems. This should only happen if the program has specifically registered itself as a "URL Handler" in the Windows registry.
 *Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1527717](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1527717)

#### [#CVE-2019-9802: Chrome process information leak](#CVE-2019-9802)

Reporter
Stephen Fewer
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can initiate an FTP download which will then use a child process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome process, which may include sensitive data.

#### [#CVE-2019-9803: Upgrade-Insecure-Requests incorrectly enforced for same-origin navigation](#CVE-2019-9803)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu, Vinothkumar Nagasayanan
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources.

#### [#CVE-2019-9804: Code execution through 'Copy as cURL' in Firefox Developer Tools on macOS](#CVE-2019-9804)

Reporter
potatoe
Impact
moderate
##### Description

In Firefox Developer Tools it is possible that pasting the result of the 'Copy as cURL' command into a command shell on macOS will cause the execution of unintended additional bash script commands if the URL was maliciously crafted. This is the result of an issue with the native version of Bash on macOS.
 *Note: This issue only affects macOS. Other operating systems are unaffected.*
