{
  "CVE-2019-9836": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) on AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) had an insecure cryptographic implementation. Specifically, the elliptic-curve (ECC) implementation was vulnerable to an invalid curve attack.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure cryptographic implementation, specifically an invalid curve attack vulnerability in the ECC implementation.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can recover the complete Platform Diffie-Hellman (PDH) private key. With the PDH, an attacker can recover the session key and the VM’s launch secret, breaking the confidentiality guarantees offered by SEV. This allows an attacker to potentially compromise encrypted virtual machines.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send small-order ECC points not on the official NIST curves to the SEV firmware during the launch-start command, forcing it to multiply the small order point by the firmware’s private DH scalar.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the SEV firmware during the VM launch process and provide specific malformed ECC parameters. This means they would have to be able to intercept or manipulate the communication between the VM and PSP."
