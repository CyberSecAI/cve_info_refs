# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

## Security is a Priority

AMD drives innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies - the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, cloud and datacenters. Security is a priority consideration from the moment our products are conceived, including intensive security reviews during the hardware and software development process.

Throughout the lifetime of a product, AMD seeks more efficient ways to make our products more secure, including working closely with partners, academics, researchers, and end users in the ecosystem. As aÂ [CNA](https://www.cve.org/) (CVE Numbering Authority) member we follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices and seek to respond quickly and appropriately to reported issues.Â

![CVE logo](/content/dam/amd/en/images/logos/partners/1782346-cve-logo.png "CVE")

As members of [FIRST](https://www.first.org/about/) (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams) our PSIRT team is trained to respond systematically to potential issues reported to AMD.

AMD also recommends users follow security best practices, including keeping your operating system up-to-date, running the latest versions of firmware and software, and regularly running antivirus software.

## Security Bulletins and Briefs

Product Security Bulletins and Briefs are listed below. Click on the Title link in the table to view more details.

* Security Bulletins: Used to communicate mitigations or guidance for newly published CVEs.
* Security Briefs: Used to inform of potential vulnerabilities where no CVE(s) have been issued by AMD and/or to provide additional communication regarding previously published potential vulnerabilities where AMD has provided prior guidance.

NOTE: An issuance of a Security Brief by AMD is not necessarily an acknowledgement that AMD products are impacted, e.g. Security Briefs may include AMD communication regarding researcher findings where AMD believes there is no product impact.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

At AMD, we treat potential security vulnerabilities seriously and seek to respond swiftly and comprehensively. From inception to production, AMD aims to incorporate security features into its products, and we actively review for potential security vulnerabilities. AMD is committed to working across the ecosystem, including customers, vendors, academics, researchers, and users, to provide a secure computing environment.

### Scope

The AMD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy covers AMD APUs, CPUs, NPUs, IPUs, DPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and software.

We encourage well-researched reports that focus on real-world security threats, including a PoC (Proof of Concept) with minimal dependencies. Reported issues requiring physical access to the system to exploit are out of scope in some situations.

AMD encourages finding and reporting potential security vulnerabilities through our [Bug Bounty program](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/amd/amd/detail) for individuals who:

* Conduct research that does not harm AMD or our customers
* Test within the scope of this Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP)
* Adhere to the applicable laws both in their location and the United States
* Refrain from disclosing vulnerability details before a mutually agreed-upon date
* Test on eligible AMD branded products and technologies that are in scope of the Program

Reports may also be submitted directly to psirt@amd.com.

### How to Submit a Vulnerability Report

Reports can be submitted via 2 methods:

1. [AMD Bug Bounty Program](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/amd/amd/detail)

   The AMD Bug Bounty Program is a collaboration between AMD and the research community. AMD believes that collaboration with security researchers and promoting security research is an important step in helping to improve the security of AMD products. We encourage security researchers to work with us to help mitigate and coordinate the disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities and look forward to working with you!Â **Refer to AMD Bug Bounty Program for more details.**

   **To report a vulnerability, please submit your report through our provider,** [**Intigriti**](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/amd/amd/detail)**.**
2. Report Directly to AMD

   To report a potential security vulnerability in any AMD product and/or technology, please email your report\* to the AMD Product Security Team at psirt@amd.com. Encryption is not required, but if preferred, you can see our [public key](/en/resources/product-security.html#key) below. Please note AMD follows Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) and expects all security researchers who submit reports to do the same.

   \*Reports should contain the following information to allow for efficient triage and analysis:

   1. Well-researched reports in English
   2. Product name, including software or firmware version
   3. Reports that include proof-of-concept code
   4. Description of how the issue was found, the impact and any potential remediation
   5. Plans or intentions for public disclosure

Note any missing information may cause delays in our ability to address the vulnerability. Security researchers who submit a validated report and follow CVD will be given credit in our published security bulletin.

### What You Can Expect From AMD

AMD currently usesCommon Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1 to assess severity and is currently in the process of transitioning from to CVSS 4.0. Throughout this transition period, our security bulletins will include both scores for reference. Use of CVSS 3.1 will be phased out in future bulletins.

The AMD Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is the focal point for reporting potential AMD product security issues; AMD PSIRT interfaces with the product security ecosystem, including security researchers, industry peers, government organizations, customers, and vendors, working together to report potential AMD product security issues.

The PSIRT team, working with various teams within AMD, follows the following high-level process:

![AMD PSIRT chart](/content/dam/amd/en/images/charts/1782346-amd-process-chart.png "AMD Flow Chart")

![Chart content 1 image](/content/dam/amd/en/images/icons/1782346-process-chart-1.jpg "1")

### Triage

Review submitted information, logs issue and assigns ticket ID, and identifies appropriate engineering team(s).

![Chart content 2 image](/content/dam/amd/en/images/icons/1782346-process-chart-2.jpg "2")

### Analysis

![Chart content 4 image](/content/dam/amd/en/images/icons/1782346-process-chart-4.jpg "4")

### Disclosure

Appropriate notification to affected customers and/or issuance of public security bulletin.

![Chart content 5 image](/content/dam/amd/en/images/icons/1782346-process-chart-5.jpg "5")

### Review

Leverage feedback from customers, researchers and internal teams to further improve product security.

### Cycle Time for Mitigation

As an upstream provider and participant in Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), AMD requires sufficient time between the initial report and public disclosure.

Some issues may require AMD to provide a mitigation to our customers, who will then integrate, and ship patched products. Other issues may require a coordinated approach where certain aspects of a mitigation may be addressed by AMD and other aspects addressed by various eco-system vendors. In all cases, AMD works to integrate any needed changes and validate mitigations while coordinating any associated disclosures.

Disclosure timeliness is determined on an issue-by-issue basis, appropriate to the situation, and with protection of the end-user in mind. In some cases, disclosure may be completed in the common embargo time period of 90 days. In most cases, however, due to eco-system and product complexity, mitigations can take longer to develop, integrate, and provide to end-users. In these cases, a longer embargo period is needed to allow vendors and partners to adequately patch systems.

### Pixel Shader on Hyper-V ([CVE-2020-6100](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=cve-2020-6100), [CVE-2020-6101](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=cve-2020-6101), [CVE-2020-6102](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=cve-2020-6102), [CVE-2020-6103](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=cve-2020-6103))

**7/14/20**

New research from our ecosystem collaborator Cisco Talos explores potential vulnerabilities in a specific virtual machine (VM) configuration using AMD GPU or APU processors. AMD will issue updated graphics drivers to help remediate the issues in September 2020.

The research finds that on a compromised Windows guest Microsoft Hyper-V VM based on an AMD GPU or APU with an AMD graphics driver installed and with Microsoftâs RemoteFX 3D feature enabled, an attacker could potentially pass maliciously malformed pixel shaders and gain access to a host machine.

RemoteFX 3D is a Microsoft feature that was previously discontinued as a new feature for VMs running Windows 10 in 2018 and in Windows Server in 2019. On July 14, 2020, Microsoft released [an advisory](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4570006/update-to-disable-and-remove-the-remotefx-vgpu-component) announcing the immediate disabling and eventual removal of its RemoteFX 3D feature.

AMD will issue updated graphics drivers to remediate these issues for existing VMs that use the RemoteFX 3D feature in September 2020 on the [AMD Support webpage](https://www.amd.com/en/support) for AMD customers that purchased an AMD GPU or APU. For original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and add-in-board (AIB) products, AMD recommends users contact the manufacturer.

### SMM Callout Privilege Escalation ([CVE-2020-12890](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2020-12890))

**6/17/20**

AMD is aware of new research related to a potential vulnerability in AMD software technology supplied to motherboard manufacturers for use in their Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) infrastructure and plans to complete delivery of updated versions designed to mitigate the issue by the end of June 2020.

The targeted attack described in the research requires privileged physical or administrative access to a system based on select AMD notebook or embedded processors. If this level of access is acquired, an attacker could potentially manipulate the AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture (AGESA) to execute arbitrary code undetected by the operating system.

AMD believes this only impacts certain client and embedded APU processors launched between 2016 and 2019. AMD has delivered the majority of the updated versions of AGESA to our motherboard partners and plans to deliver the remaining versions by the end of June 2020. AMD recommends following the security best practice of keeping devices up-to-date with the latest patches. End users with questions about whether their system is running on these latest versions should contact their motherboard or original equipment/system manufacturer.

We thank Danny Odler for his ongoing security research.

### TRRespassÂ [(CVE-2020-10255)](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10255)

**UPDATED 5/22/20 (originally posted 3/10/20)**

AMD is aware of new research related to an industry-wide DRAM issue called TRRespass whereby researchers demonstrated a method that claims to bypass existing Targeted Row Refresh (TRR) mitigations. AMD microprocessor products include memory controllers designed to meet industry-standard DDR specifications, and we have enabled platform providers with an expanded set of controls that can be configured into their BIOSâ in consultation with DRAM vendors. Susceptibility varies based on DRAM device, vendor, technology and system settings.

AMD recommends contacting the DRAM or system manufacturer to determine any susceptibility to this issue, in addition to enabling existing DRAM mitigations that reduce a systemâs susceptibility to Row Hammer-style attacks like TRRespass, including:

* Using DRAM supporting Error Correcting Codes (ECC)
* Using DRAM and memory controllers supporting Targeted Row Refresh (TRR)
* Using memory refresh rates above 1x
* Using AMD CPUs with memory controllers that support a Maximum Activate Count (MAC)

We thank the researchers for their collaboration and participating in the industry best practice of coordinated disclosure. For more information on their research, visit their [website](https://www.vusec.net/projects/trrespass).

### Take A Way

**3/7/20**

We are aware of a new white paper that claims potential security exploits in AMD CPUs, whereby a malicious actor could manipulate a cache-related feature to potentially transmit user data in an unintended way. The researchers then pair this data path with known and mitigated software or speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities. AMD believes these are not new speculation-based attacks.

AMD continues to recommend the following best practices to help mitigate against side-channel issues:

* Keeping your operating system up-to-date by operating at the latest version revisions of platform software and firmware, which include existing mitigations for speculation-based vulnerabilities
* Following secure coding methodologies
* Implementing the latest patched versions of critical libraries, including those susceptible to side channel attacks
* Utilizing safe computer practices and running antivirus software

### Shader Functionality Remote Code ExecutionÂ ([CVE-2019-5049](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5049), [CVE-2019-5098](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5098), [CVE-2019-5146](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5146), [CVE-2019-5147](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5147), [CVE-2019-5124](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5124), [CVE-2019-5183](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5183))

**UPDATED 1/27/20 and 12/3/19 to add new CVE# (originally posted 9/16/19)**

Through ongoing collaboration with industry partners, AMD became aware of a potential vulnerability in a specific virtual machine application when using an AMD GPU or APU and has delivered an updated graphics driver to remediate the exploit.

The specific conditions of this exploit require a virtual machine with an AMD GPU or APU running VMware Workstation Pro on a compromised guest Windows OS. Under these conditions, an attacker could modify a compiled shader and use it to expose sensitive user information. AMD updated the kernel mode driver code in its graphics drivers starting with version 19.8.1 to remediate this application exploit.

The updated graphics drivers are available on the [AMD Support webpage](https://www.amd.com/en/support) for AMD customers that purchased an AMD GPU or APU. For original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and add-in-board (AIB) products, AMD recommends users contact the manufacturer.

We thank Cisco Talos for their collaboration on this matter and allowing us the necessary time to prepare mitigations. For more information, visit their [website](https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports).

### Screwed DriversÂ

**8/11/19Â**

At AMD, security is a top priority. We were made aware of the public disclosure of potential industry-wide, driver-related vulnerabilities on August 11, 2019 and, after gaining new information from the researcher, AMD now believes this is related to a disclosure communicated to us earlier this year regarding the AMDVBFlash graphics driver tool that was temporarily made available on our website so early adopters of older AMD graphics products could perform a needed Video BIOS refresh and has since been removed. AMD is continuing to investigate the issue to determine if any other of our drivers may be affected.Â

Â

### SWAPGS ([CVE-2019-1125](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1125))

**8/6/19**

AMD is aware of [new research](https://www.bitdefender.com/business/swapgs-attack.html) claiming new speculative execution attacks that may allow access to privileged kernel data. Based on external and internal analysis, AMD believes it is not vulnerable to the SWAPGS variant attacks because AMD products are designed not to speculate on the new GS value following a speculative SWAPGS. For the attack that is not a SWAPGS variant, the mitigation is to implement our existing recommendations for Spectre variant 1.

Specific details by published description:

| **Description** | **AMD Recommendation** |
| --- | --- |
| *SWAPGS instruction speculation at CPL3*  *(Scenario 1)* | AMD believed not impacted |
| *SWAPGS instruction speculation at CPL0*  *(Scenario 2, Variant 1)* | AMD believed not impacted |
| *GS base value speculation*  *(Scenario 2, Variant 2)* | AMD recommends implementing existing mitigations for Spectre variant 1 |

### Secure Encrypted Virtualization Invalid ECC Curve Points ([CVE-2019-9836](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9836))

**6/25/19**

At AMD, security remains a top priority and we continue to work to identify any potential risks for our customers. Through ongoing collaboration with industry researchers AMD became aware that, if using the user-selectable AMD secure encryption feature on a virtual machine running the Linux operating system, an encryption key could be compromised by manipulating the encryption technologyâs behavior. AMD released firmware-based cryptography updates to our ecosystem partners and on the [AMD website](https://developer.amd.com/sev/) to remediate this risk.

### Â

### RamBleed ([CVE-2019-0174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0174))

**6/12/19**

Researchers reported a new vulnerability called RamBleed that exploits the electrical interaction between close-packed DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM circuitry to potentially expose kernel privileges and confidential information. Based on our internal analysis, AMD believes the industry-known mitigations for RowHammer, in addition to AMD Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), protect against RamBleed.

**Previous RowHammer Guidance**

The RowHammer issue identified in the Google release is an industry-wide DRAM issue that affects DRAMs manufactured on newer process technologies that are not designed to address this issue.Â  AMD microprocessor products include memory controllers designed to meet industry-standard DDR specifications.

The possibility of this issue happening on a system depends on the DRAM in the system. Susceptibility to this issue varies by DRAM vendor, technology, and DRAM device. Contact your system vendor to see if you have susceptible DRAM.

**Mitigations include:**

* Upgrade the system BIOS to double the refresh rate to reduce the error rate; or
* Use memory manufactured on older and unaffected technologies or newer memory that has design fixes to address this problem and upgrade your BIOS to recognize the newer memory.

### Fallout, Rogue In-Flight Data Load (RIDL), and ZombieLoad Attack ([CVE-2018-12126](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12126),Â [CVE-2018-12130](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12130),Â [CVE-2018-12127](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-12127),Â [CVE-2019-11091](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11091))Â

**5/14/19**

At AMD we develop our products and services with security in mind. Based on our analysis and discussions with the researchers, we believe our products are not susceptible to âFalloutâ, âRIDLâ or âZombieLoad Attackâ because of the hardware protection checks in our architecture. We have not been able to demonstrate these exploits on AMD products and are unaware of others having done so.Â

For more information, see our new white paper, titled â[Speculation Behavior in AMD Micro-Architectures](https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/security-whitepaper.pdf).â

### SPOILER ([CVE-2019-0162](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-0162))

**3/15/19**

We are aware of the report of a new security exploit called SPOILER which can gain access to partial address information during load operations.Â TheÂ SPOILER exploit can gain access to partial address information above address bit 11 during load operations. AMD processors do not use partial address matches above address bit 11 when resolving load conflicts.Â

### SplitSpectre

**12/6/18**

AMD is aware of theÂ [latest research published](https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/researchers-discover-splitspectre-a-new-spectre-like-cpu-attack/)Â claiming new approaches to speculative execution attacks called SplitSpectre. AMD believes the mitigation is to implement our existing speculative execution recommendations.

Â

### PortSmash ([CVE-2018-5407](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5407))

**11/27/18**

AMD does not believe the PortSmash issue (<https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2018/q4/123>) is related to previously found speculative execution issues like Spectre.Â  Instead, AMD believes the issues are related to any processor that uses simultaneous multithreading (SMT), including those from AMD, that is vulnerable to software that exposes the activity of one process to another running on the same processor. We believe this issue can be mitigated in software by using side-channel counter measures. For example, OpenSSL, which was used in the researcherâs proof of concept, has already been updated to address this type of attack. Â

Â

### AMD Response to Systematic Evaluations of Transient Execution Variants

**11/13/18**

AMD is aware of the [latest research published](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05441) claiming new speculative execution attacks. AMD believes it is not vulnerable to some of these attacks because of the hardware paging architecture protections in AMD devices and, for those that are not solved by our paging architecture protections, the mitigation is to implement our existing recommendations.

Specific recommendations by published description:

**New Variants of Spectre v1 â AMD recommends implementing existing mitigations**

* Pattern History Table - Cross Address - Out of Place (PHT-CA-OP)
* Pattern History Table - Cross Address - In Place (PHT-CA-IP)
* Pattern History Table - Same Address - Out of Place (PHT-SA-OP)

**New Variants of Spectre v2 â AMD recommends implementing existing mitigations**

* Branch Target Buffer - Same Address - In Place (BTB-SA-IP)
* Branch Target Buffer - Same Address - Out of Place (BTB-SA-OP)

**New Variant of Meltdown**

* Meltdown-BK â AMD believes this does not affect its platforms because AMD does not have this feature in its products

**New Variant of Spectre v1 â referred by researchers as a Meltdown variant**

* Meltdown-BD â AMD believes 32-bit systems using the BOUND instruction may be impacted and recommends implementing existing mitigations for Spectre v1 for such systems.

### 2018 Firmware TPM Updates

**9/26/18**

Earlier this year, AMD disclosed mitigations related to potential security vulnerabilities for AMD firmware Trusted Platform Module (fTPM) versions v.96, v1.22, and v1.37. AMD believes the fTPM vulnerabilities only apply to some of its client processors as fTPM is not enabled on AMD server, graphics and embedded products. AMD has delivered a patch to PC manufacturers to address the issue.

Microsoft Windows users can verify their fTPM version and find instructions to clear the TPM at: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-security/tpm/initialize-and-configure-ownership-of-the-tpm>

AMD has recommended that PC manufacturers qualify and release an updated BIOS integrating the fTPM patch, as appropriate, into production at the next available opportunity and provide guidance to end users to apply fixes as defined based on the product. For fTPM v1.37, AMD has notified PC manufacturers that they should consider updating the system BIOS ahead of clearing the fTPM to help protect generated platform-level keys.

AMD recommends users contact their PC manufacturer for platform-specific instructions as a part of following best security practices to keep devices up-to-date with the latest patches.

### Foreshadow ([CVE-2018-3615](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3615), [CVE-2018-3620](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3620), [CVE-2018-3646](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3646))

**8/14/18 â Updated**

As in the case with Meltdown, we believe our processors are not susceptible to these new speculative execution attack variants: L1 Terminal Fault â SGX (also known as Foreshadow) CVE 2018-3615, L1 Terminal Fault â OS/SMM (also known as Foreshadow-NG) CVE 2018-3620, and L1 Terminal Fault â VMM (also known as Foreshadow-NG) CVE 2018-3646, due to our hardware paging architecture protections. We are advising customers running AMD EPYCâ¢ processors in their data centers, including in virtualized environments, to not implement Foreshadow-related software mitigations for their AMD platforms.

### Spectre Mitigation Update

**7/13/18**

This week, a sub-variant of the original, Google Project (GPZ) variant 1 / Spectre security vulnerability was [disclosed by MIT](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vlk/spectre11.pdf). Consistent with variant 1, we believe this threat can be mitigated through the operating system (OS). AMD is working with the software ecosystem to mitigate variant 1.1 through operating system updates where necessary. We have not identified any AMD x86 products susceptible to the Variant 1.2 vulnerability in our analysis to-date. Please check with your OS provider for the latest information.

AMD has also updated related portions of the [Software Techniques for Managing Speculation on AMD Processors](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/90343-B_SoftwareTechniquesforManagingSpeculation_WP_7-18Update_FNL.pdf) white paper.

### Â

### TLBleed

**7/12/18**

Based on our analysis to date we have not identified any AMD products that are vulnerable to TLBleed side channel attack identified by researchers.Â Â  Security remains a top priority and we will continue to work to identify any potential risks for our customers and, if needed, potential mitigations.

Â

### LazyFPU ([CVE-2018-3665](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3665))

**6/18/18**

Based on our analysis to date, because of our unique processor implementation we currently do not believe our products are susceptible to the resent security vulnerability identified around lazy FPU switching

### âSpeculative Store Bypassâ Vulnerability Mitigations for AMD Platforms

**5/21/18**

Today, Microsoft and Google Project Zero researchers [have identified](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1528) a new category of speculative execution side channel vulnerability (Speculative Store Bypass or SSB) that is closely related to the previously disclosed GPZ/Spectre variant 1 vulnerabilities. Â Microsoft has released [an advisory](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180012) on the vulnerability and mitigation plans.Â

AMD recommended mitigations for SSB are being provided by operating system updates back to the Family 15 processors (âBulldozerâ products). For technical details, please see the [AMD white paper](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/124441_AMD64_SpeculativeStoreBypassDisable_Whitepaper_final.pdf). Microsoft is completing final testing and validation of AMD-specific updates for Windows client and server operating systems, which are expected to be released through their standard update process.Â  Similarly, Linux distributors are developing operating system updates for SSB. AMD recommends checking with your OS provider for specific guidance on schedules.

Based on the difficulty to exploit the vulnerability, AMD and our ecosystem partners currently recommend using the default setting that maintains support for memory disambiguation.

We have not identified any AMD x86 products susceptible to the Variant 3a vulnerability in our analysis to-date.

As a reminder, security best practices of keeping your operating system and BIOS up-to-date, utilizing safe computer practices and running antivirus software are always the first line of defense in maintaining device security.

Â

### Spectre Mitigation Update

**4/10/18** Â (Updated 5/8/18 to reflect Microsoft release of Windows Server 2016)

Today, AMD is providing updates regarding our recommended mitigations for Google Project Zero (GPZ) Variant 2 (Spectre) for Microsoft Windows users. These mitigations require a combination of processor microcode updates from our OEM and motherboard partners, as well as running the current and fully up-to-date version of Windows. For Linux users, AMD recommended mitigations for GPZ Variant 2 were made available to our Linux partners and have been released to distribution earlier this year.

As a reminder, GPZ Variant 1 (Spectre) mitigation is provided through operating system updates that were made available previously by AMD ecosystem partners. GPZ Variant 3 (Meltdown) does not apply to AMD because of our processor design.Â

While we believe it is difficult to exploit Variant 2 on AMD processors, we actively worked with our customers and partners to deploy the above described combination of operating system patches and microcode updates for AMD processors to further mitigate the risk. A [white paper](https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/Architecture_Guidelines_Update_Indirect_Branch_Control.pdf) detailing the AMD recommended mitigation for Windows is available, as well as links to ecosystem resources for the latest updates.Â

Â

**Operating System Updates for GPZ Variant 2/Spectre**

Microsoft is releasing an operating system update containing Variant 2 (Spectre) mitigations for AMD users running Windows 10 (version 1709) today. Support for these mitigations for AMD processors in Windows Server 2016 is expected to be available following final validation and testing.Â (Note: May 8, 2018 Microsoft released [an operating system update for Windows Server 2016](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002).)

Â

**AMD Microcode Updates for GPZ Variant 2/Spectre**

In addition, microcode updates with our recommended mitigations addressing Variant 2 (Spectre) have been released to our customers and ecosystem partners for AMD processors dating back to the first âBulldozerâ core products introduced in 2011.Â

AMD customers will be able to install the microcode by downloading BIOS updates provided by PC and server manufacturers and motherboard providers.Â  Please check with your provider for the latest updates.

We will provide further updates as appropriate on this site as AMD and the industry continue our collaborative work to develop solutions to protect users from security threats.

# AMD-SEV: Platform DH key recovery via invalid curve attack (CVE-2019-9836)

---

*From*: Cfir Cohen via Fulldisclosure <fulldisclosure () seclists org>

*Date*: Tue, 25 Jun 2019 10:00:27 -0700

```
Overview
========
AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is a hardware memory encryption
feature. SEV protects guest virtual machines from the hypervisor, provides
confidentiality guarantees at runtime and remote attestation at launch
time. See [1] for details. SEV key management code runs inside the Platform
Security Processor (PSP) [2].

The SEV elliptic-curve (ECC) implementation was found to be vulnerable to
an invalid curve attack. At launch-start command, an attacker can send
small order ECC points not on the official NIST curves, and force the SEV
firmware to multiply a small order point by the firmware’s private DH
scalar.

By collecting enough modular residues, an attacker can recover the complete
PDH private key. With the PDH, an attacker can recover the session key and
the VM’s launch secret. This breaks the confidentiality guarantees offered
by SEV.

Key exchange during VM launch
=========================

1. The PSP publishes its PDH public key through SEV_PDH_CERT_EXPORT
command. This key is computed by multiplying the ECC generator (NIST
P256/P384 curves are supported) by the PDH private key: A<-G*k, where k,
the private key, is randomly generated in the range (1, order(G)).

2. The client generates its private DH key, s, and computes the shared key
C<-A*s=G*k*s. C is the shared point on the curve. Its x-coordinate is
hashed and used as the master shared secret. Two keys KEK/KIK are derived
from the master secret, and used to protect (encryption+integrity) the
session keys.

3. The client computes its public key B<-G*s and sends it to the PSP
through the SEV_LAUNCH_START command.

4. The PSP computes the shared key C by multiplying the client’s public key
by its PDH private scalar: C<-B*k=G*s*k. Like the client, the PSP takes C’s
x coordinate, computes the master shared secret and derives the KEK/KIK.
These are used to unwrap the session keys. See API specification [3] for
details.

ECDH security relies on the generator point, G, having a large order and on
the discrete logarithm problem being hard for the curve.

Note that in step 4, the PSP performs a computation with its private key on
user supplied data - the client’s public point.

Invalid curve attack
===============

ECC point multiplication relies on a point addition primitive. There are
different implementations for ECC point addition. A common one is based on
the short Weierstrass ECC form, as described in [4]. Note that the curve’s
"b" equation parameter is never used.

An invalid curve attack is where the ECDH point multiplication is done on a
different curve - different (a,b) parameters. This becomes possible in the
short Weierstrass point addition function since the "b" parameter is not
used. On this curve, the point has a small prime order. By trying all
possible values for the small order point, an attacker can recover the
private scalar bits (modulo the order). The modular residues are assembled
offline using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, leading to a full key
recovery. See the original paper [5] on invalid curve attacks, or a more
recent paper [6] on the topic.

Affected products
=============

AMD EPYC server platforms (codename "Naples") running SEV firmware version
0.17 build 11 and below are affected.

Fix
===

We were able to verify the fix is properly implemented in build 22 [7]: PSP
rejects points not on the NIST curve, and fails with INVALID_CERT error.

Additional issues
=============

Certificates for PDH keys generated on a vulnerable system are still valid.
This means SEV might still be vulnerable to a migration attack, where a
client’s VM is migrated from a non-vulnerable system to a vulnerable one.

In addition, at this point, it is not clear whether SEV is vulnerable to a
FW downgrade attack.
