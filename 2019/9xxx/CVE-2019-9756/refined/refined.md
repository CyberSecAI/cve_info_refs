{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly validate user authorization when adding groups to a project, allowing an attacker to add public groups to their project by manipulating the `link_group_id` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can add a public group to their private or public project. This results in all members of the public group gaining access to the attacker's project.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/1110vijaykumar0007/testpersonalproject/group_links` endpoint. Specifically, the `link_group_id` parameter is manipulated to add a public group.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have an account on the platform and be able to create a new project. They also need to know the ID of the target public group."
