Because of this, the HostPort/portmap rule could match incoming traffic even if there were better fitting, more specific service definition rules like NodePorts later in the chain.\n\nSwitching the portmap plugin to append its rules, rather than prepend, allows traffic to be processed by KUBE-SERVICES rules first. Only if traffic does not match a service will it be considered for HostPorts. This is compatible with the behavior of the legacy ‘kubenet’ network driver.",
