Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9842:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `SaveFilesToDisk` method within the `PostHandler.cs` file of the MiniBlog application. This method processes blog post content, identifies embedded data URLs (specifically within `src` and `href` attributes), and saves the decoded data as files on the server's disk. The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper validation of the extracted data, allowing for the upload of arbitrary file types.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of file type validation:** The code extracts the file extension from the MIME type within the data URL. It does not check if the extracted extension is safe or allowed (e.g., executable files like ASPX).
*   **Unrestricted file upload:** The extracted data from the data URL is directly written to disk using the derived filename and extension.
*   **Path disclosure:** The full path to the uploaded file is returned and rendered in the HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By embedding a data URL with a malicious ASPX file (or any executable file that the server can execute), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful code execution can lead to complete server control, potentially compromising data, infrastructure, and other resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by creating or editing blog posts through the application's web interface.
*   **Data URL Injection:** The attacker needs to inject a crafted data URL into the post content (e.g., in the `img` tag).
*   **Malicious MIME Type:** The data URL must contain a crafted MIME type where the file extension is something executable such as 'aspx'.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated user with post editing privileges:** The attacker needs to be logged in and have the ability to create or modify posts.
*   **Knowledge of data URL format:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct data URLs and how they are processed by the application.
*   **Payload creation:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious payload in base64 format.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was found in both MiniBlog and MiniBlog.Core projects.
*   The MiniBlog.Core project had a slight variation where the filename can be controlled through the `data-filename` attribute.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit demonstrates how an ASPX payload can be uploaded and executed to achieve RCE.
*   The PoC includes steps for authentication, retrieving required tokens, injecting the malicious data URL, and executing the uploaded payload.
*   The CVSS v3 vector for the vulnerability is `AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C`, indicating a critical severity.
