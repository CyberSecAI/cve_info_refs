- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of encryption in signal transmission and the predictability of rolling codes used by the ABUS Secvest wireless remote controls (FUBE50014 and FUBE50015).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unencrypted signal communication.
    - Predictable rolling codes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can desynchronize a wireless remote control from the Secvest alarm system. This causes the alarm system to ignore commands from the legitimate remote control until the rolling code sequence aligns again. This leads to a denial of service, rendering the remote control temporarily unusable for arming/disarming the alarm system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed wirelessly. An attacker needs to be within range to observe the wireless communication between the remote and the base station.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be within wireless range of the remote control and the alarm system.
    - The attacker needs the ability to capture and analyze the rolling code sequence.
    - The attacker needs the ability to generate and transmit valid rolling codes.
