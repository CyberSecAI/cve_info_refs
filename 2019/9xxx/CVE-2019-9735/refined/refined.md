{
  "CVE-2019-9735": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect validation of port settings in the iptables security group driver of OpenStack Neutron.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect validation of input parameters",
      "Lack of proper input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated user can create a malformed security group rule which, when applied, causes an error in the iptables configuration on the compute node. This prevents further security group rules from being applied, effectively causing a denial of service by blocking network connectivity for other tenants on the same compute node.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Creation of a security group rule with a destination port for an unsupported protocol via the OpenStack Neutron API."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated user with the ability to create security group rules within OpenStack Neutron."
  }
}
