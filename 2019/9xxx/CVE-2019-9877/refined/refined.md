The provided content is related to CVE-2019-9877.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in an invalid memory access within the `TextPage::findGaps()` function in `TextOutputDev.c`. Specifically, the issue arises from an out-of-bounds access in the `horizProfile` array due to an incorrect calculation of the index `y - yMinI`. The value of `yMinI` is `2147483647`, and `y` is `1569`. Thus, the calculation results in an out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is an improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119), leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation leads to a denial of service (segmentation fault) and may have other unspecified impacts, which could potentially include arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted PDF file to the `pdftops` binary of the vulnerable software (xpdf).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PDF file to the vulnerable `pdftops` binary. This could be achieved through various means such as user interaction with a malicious PDF or by tricking a server into processing such a file.
