Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9213:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `expand_downwards` function within the Linux kernel's memory management (`mm`) subsystem. Specifically, the `security_mmap_addr()` function, which performs a capability check with `current_cred()`, is called in contexts where `current_cred()` should not be used, which can occur from contexts like a VFS write handler. This missing check allows stack segments, including those of other processes, to grow downwards to address 0, thus exacerbating the impact of NULL pointer dereferences on systems without SMAP or PAN.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect Capability Check:** The capability check in `security_mmap_addr()` uses `current_cred()` which is incorrect when called from certain contexts like a VFS write handler.
*   **Missing Minimum Address Enforcement:** The `expand_downwards` function did not enforce the minimum address for memory mappings, particularly when expanding stack segments downwards.
*   **Stack Growth to NULL:** Privileged tasks could force the stack to grow down towards address zero.
*   **Exploitable NULL Pointer Dereference:** This weakness allows a local attacker to exploit NULL pointer dereferences for privilege escalation (on systems without SMAP/PAN), whereas they would otherwise only lead to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** On systems without SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this vulnerability could elevate the impact of a NULL pointer dereference from a simple denial-of-service to a privilege escalation. This is because the ability to map address zero can lead to exploitable null pointer dereferences.
*   **Denial of service:** On systems where privilege escalation isn't possible, the vulnerability still enables attackers to create a denial of service

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The primary attack vector is local. A privileged user or process can cause the stack segments to grow downward to address zero through a crafted system call sequence, or by exploiting a code path via the VFS write handler.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Privileged Context:** The attacker needs to be a privileged user or process able to call a system call to trigger the stack expansion.
*   **No SMAP/PAN:** Systems that are vulnerable are those lacking SMAP (Supervisor Mode Access Prevention) on x86 architectures or PAN (Privileged Access Never) on ARM architectures.
*   **Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the specific call sequence to trigger the vulnerability and possibly the target system's memory layout.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects systems that do not have SMAP or PAN.
- Patches were created to enforce a minimum address, even when a capability check succeeds.
- A Debian LTS advisory, DLA 1731-1 and DLA 1771-1, covers this CVE, along with other kernel vulnerabilities.
- Red Hat addressed this issue in multiple advisories (RHSA-2019:1479, RHSA-2019:1480 etc).
- Ubuntu also issued a USN to address this issue (USN-3932-1, USN-3933-2).
- The fix involves checking if the target address is below a minimum address, and if it is, returning an error (-EPERM) rather than going through a capability check.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jann Horn.
- A patch from the Linux kernel mailing list ("mm: enforce min addr even if capable() in expand\_downwards()") that addresses this issue is included in the content.
