# 2019-SV2 Group Permissions

affects OMERO.server versions 5.1.0 to 5.6.0

---

 [back to Advisories](/security/advisories/)

---

### Synopsis

Permissions on OMERO model objects may be circumvented during certain operations such as move and delete.

### Background

The OMERO Blitz API offers several [graph operations](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero-blitz/5.5.6/slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify2.html) that modify user data. The code checks permissions manually as it operates.

OMERO 5.6.1 improves the permissions query to take account of a model object's group context and ensure that all graph operations comply with the user's permissions.

This vulnerability is identified as [CVE-2019-9943](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9943).

### Affected Packages

OMERO.server from 5.1.0 to 5.6.0 inclusive.

### Impact

Medium severity.

[CVSS score 5.3 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C)

### Resolution

All OMERO.servers should be upgraded to at least 5.6.1.
