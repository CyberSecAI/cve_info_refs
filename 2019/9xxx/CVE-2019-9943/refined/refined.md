CVE-2019-9943
```

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Permissions on OMERO model objects could be circumvented during certain operations like move and delete due to insufficient permission checks in the OMERO Blitz API graph operations. The code manually checks permissions as it operates, but the permission query did not fully account for a model object's group context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Insufficient permission checks during graph operations in the OMERO Blitz API.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Circumvention of permissions on OMERO model objects, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification (move, delete).  High impact on confidentiality, low impact on integrity, and no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:** Exploitation occurs through the OMERO Blitz API, specifically during graph operations that modify user data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have low privileges and the attack has high attack complexity.
