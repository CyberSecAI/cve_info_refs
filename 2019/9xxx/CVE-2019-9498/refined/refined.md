  "CVE-2019-9498": {
    "description": "The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd EAP Server, when built against a crypto library missing explicit validation on imported elements, do not validate the scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit. An attacker may be able to use invalid scalar/element values to complete authentication, gaining session key and network access without needing or learning the password. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.4 are affected. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.",
    "affected_components": [
      "hostapd",
      "wpa_supplicant"

    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of scalar and element values within EAP-pwd-Commit messages in hostapd EAP server when built against a crypto library that does not perform explicit validation on imported elements.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Missing validation of scalar and element values in EAP-pwd-Commit messages."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication, obtain a session key, and gain unauthorized network access without knowing the password.",
