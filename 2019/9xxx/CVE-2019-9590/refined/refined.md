{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The T-920 PLC CPU enters a failure mode when reading a single coil with a specific UID (0x43), causing a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of specific network data packets leading to denial of service.",
      "Lack of input validation or error handling when processing specific UID values in network communication."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a persistent denial-of-service (DoS) condition, forcing the PLC to restart repeatedly and disrupting its normal operation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted network data packet to the T-920 PLC with UID 0x43 when reading a single coil."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the PLC on the same network."
