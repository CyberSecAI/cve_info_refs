Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-9796:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SMIL animation controller incorrectly registers with the refresh driver twice when only a single registration is expected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability.
- Double registration of the SMIL animation controller with the refresh driver.
- Dangling pointer left in the refresh driver's observer array after the animation controller element is freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A potentially exploitable crash.
- Memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript code within a webpage that manipulates SMIL animations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject and execute JavaScript code on a vulnerable webpage.
- No special privileges required on the victim's system.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the SMIL animation controller interacts with the refresh driver. The controller registers itself with the driver when it has both time containers and animation elements. The vulnerability happens when the controller registers multiple times. Specifically, the `NotifyRefreshDriverCreated` method does not verify the count of child containers before registering with the refresh driver.

When the animation controller element is removed from the DOM, the refresh driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the observer array. Subsequent access to this dangling pointer results in a use-after-free condition.

The fix involves adding a check to the `NotifyRefreshDriverCreated` method to prevent double registration.

This issue affects Firefox and Thunderbird, and patches have been released for affected versions. Red Hat also released patches for their products that include the vulnerable components.
