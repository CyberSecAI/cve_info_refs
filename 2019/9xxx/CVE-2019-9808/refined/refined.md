  "CVE-2019-9808": {
    "description": "If WebRTC permission is requested from documents with data: or blob: URLs, the permission notifications do not properly display the originating domain. The notification states \"Unknown origin\" as the requestee, leading to user confusion about which site is asking for this permission.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of data: and blob: URLs when requesting WebRTC permissions. Instead of displaying the originating domain, the permission notification shows \"Unknown origin.\"",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect origin display for WebRTC permissions",
      "User confusion"
    ],
    "impact": "User confusion and potentially unintended granting of permissions due to the lack of clear origin information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web pages using data: or blob: URLs requesting WebRTC permissions"
    ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker could craft a web page with a data: or blob: URL that requests WebRTC permissions, causing a user to see \"Unknown origin\" in the permission prompt, which may lead the user to grant the permission unknowingly. "
