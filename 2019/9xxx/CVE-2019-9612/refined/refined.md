```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper file type and content validation during file uploads within the `ComnController.java` file in OFCMS. The system only checks if the filename ends with `.jsp` or `.jspx` but is vulnerable to bypass.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Insufficient file name validation allowing bypass through truncation techniques.",
    "Lack of file content validation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary JSP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can upload a malicious JSP file through the vulnerable upload function of the application by submitting a crafted multipart form request. The file name is truncated after the jsp extension to bypass the validation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged into the backend of the OFCMS system to exploit this vulnerability."
