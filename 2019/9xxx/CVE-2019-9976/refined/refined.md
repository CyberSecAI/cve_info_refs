- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Boa webserver on DASAN H660RM devices with firmware 1.03-0022 saves POST data, including credentials, to the `/tmp/boa-temp` file. This file is not sanitized after the request is processed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file usage (CWE-377). Credentials sent via POST are written to a temporary file and not deleted or sanitized.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve login credentials by accessing the `/tmp/boa-temp` file until another POST request overwrites it.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be logged in to the device, either through Telnet, SSH or Web UI. If logged in via the Web UI, and no other POST requests have been made, the credentials of the user can be retrieved from `/tmp/boa-temp`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs to have a valid login session on the device via Telnet, SSH or Web UI to access the /tmp/boa-temp file.
