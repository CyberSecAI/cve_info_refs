The provided content describes multiple CSRF vulnerabilities in Pluck CMS version 4.7.9.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their consent. Specifically, the application uses GET requests for actions that modify data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CSRF tokens or other CSRF protection mechanisms.
- Using GET requests for actions that modify data.
- Insecure implementation allowing the deletion of resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick an authenticated administrator into performing unwanted actions, including:
    - Deleting images.
    - Deleting themes.
    - Removing modules.
    - Deleting articles.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can use an iframe to trigger the malicious requests on a page visited by the authenticated admin. The victim needs to be logged into the Pluck CMS admin panel when the iframe is loaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host malicious HTML content that contains the crafted iframe.
- The attacker needs a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious page.
