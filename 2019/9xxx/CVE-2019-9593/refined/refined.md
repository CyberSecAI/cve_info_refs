  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2019-9593",
      "root_cause": "The application suffers from multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in URL parameters, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Reflected XSS",
        "Session Fixation",
		"Insecure cookies"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, sensitive information disclosure (via cookie theft), or other malicious actions. Session cookies are also flagged as insecure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted URLs that inject JavaScript code into vulnerable parameters.",
		"Directly injecting malicious scripts into affected URL parameters, such as brandUrl, url and page."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft malicious URLs containing XSS payloads and then trick the victim into clicking the link or accessing the malicious URL in their browser. Additionally, an attacker with knowledge of the vulnerable URL parameters, can directly exploit the XSS vulnerabilities."
