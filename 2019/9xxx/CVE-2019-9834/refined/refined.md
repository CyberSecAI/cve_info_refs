```
- Root cause of vulnerability: HTML injection vulnerability in NetData v1.13.0.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data within the exported snapshot functionality, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to stealing cookie-based authentication credentials, controlling the rendering of the site, or other attacks.
- Attack vectors:
    1.  An attacker exports a valid NetData snapshot.
    2.  The attacker injects malicious HTML code into the snapshot file.
    3.  The attacker imports the modified snapshot into NetData.
    4.  The injected HTML executes in the victim's browser when viewing the imported snapshot.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to export a NetData snapshot and then import a modified snapshot.
