| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |

The vulnerability is due to incorrect isolation of the secondary management interface from internal sysadmin applications. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to one of the listening internal applications. A successful exploit could result in unstable conditions, including both a denial of service and remote unauthenticated access to the device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers that are running an affected version of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software and have the secondary management interface (physically MGT LAN 1 on the route switch processor (RSP)) connected and configured. To determine if the secondary management interface is connected, log in to the sysadmin virtual machine and use the **show interface** command. If the secondary management interface is configured and connected, the device is vulnerable as shown in the following example (in dual route switch processor/route processor (RSP/RP) systems, check both active and standby RSP/RP):  ```   sysadmin-vm:0_RSP1:eXR# show interface   Tue Mar  19 19:32:00.839 UTC   MgmtEth0/RSP1/0/0  Link encap: Ethernet  HWaddr 08:96:ad:22:7a:31     inet  addr: 192.168.0.1       UP RUNNING BROADCAST MULTICAST   MTU:1500  Metric:1     RX packets:      14093 errors:0 dropped:1 overruns:0   frame:0     TX packets:         49 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0                            collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000     RX bytes:                867463  TX bytes:                  6889      sysadmin-vm:0_RSP1:eXR#   ```  For more information about which Cisco IOS XR Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS-XR 64 bit Software running on platforms other than the ASR9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers.  Workarounds  * Customers can perform the following workaround, which is equivalent to upgrading to a fixed software release. Although the reload of the sysadmin VM is hitless, Cisco recommends performing this change during a maintenance window: **Step 1:** Access the sysadmin VM:   ```   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:eXR#admin   Tue Mar 12 22:46:37.110 UTC      root connected from 127.0.0.1 using console on host   ``` **Step 2:** Run bash and edit the *calvados\_bootstrap.cfg* file:   ```   sysadmin-vm:0_RSP1:eXR# run bash   Tue Mar 12 22:46:44.224 UTC   bash-4.3# vi /etc/init.d/calvados_bootstrap.cfg   ```  **Step 3:** Edit the file by changing:    ```   #CTRL_VRF=0   #MGMT_VRF=2   ```  To:  ```   CTRL_VRF=0   MGMT_VRF=2   ```  Exit the file and save. In dual RSP/RP systems, the edit must be performed on both active and standby RSP/RPs.  **Step 4:** Reload the sysadmin VM (repeat for both in dual systems):  ```   sysadmin-vm:0_RSP1:eXR# reload admin location 0/RSP1   Tue Mar 12 22:49:28.589 UTC   Reload node ? [no,yes] yes   result Admin VM graceful reload request on 0/RSP1 succeeded.   sysadmin-vm:0_RSP1:eXR# RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:Mar 12 22:49:34.059 UTC: rmf_svr[402]: %PKT_INFRA-FM-3-FAULT_MAJOR : ALARM_MAJOR :RP-RED-LOST-ADMINNR :DECLARE :0/RSP1/CPU0:      Confd is down   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:eXR#   ```  Wait till the admin VM returns:  ```   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:eXR#0/RSP1/ADMIN0:Mar 12 22:59:30.220 UTC: envmon[3680]: %PKT_INFRA-FM-3-FAULT_MAJOR : ALARM_MAJOR :Power Module redundancy lost :DECLARE :0:   RP/0/RSP1/CPU0:Mar 12 22:59:33.708 UTC: rmf_svr[402]: %PKT_INFRA-FM-3-FAULT_MAJOR : ALARM_MAJOR :RP-RED-LOST-ADMINNR :CLEAR :0/RSP1/CPU0:   ```  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases This vulnerability has been fixed in Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software Release 6.5.3 and 7.0.1, which will edit the *calvados\_boostrap.cfg* file and reload the device.  Cisco will not publish a software maintenance upgrade (SMU) for this vulnerability due to the effectiveness of the workaround.
