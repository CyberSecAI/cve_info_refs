- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain components in the underlying Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to insufficient data protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker could access sensitive system usage information, including tracking data and usage statistics.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker attempts to observe network traffic when accessing the Cisco APIC web-based management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs remote access to the Cisco APIC web-based management interface and the ability to observe network traffic.
