Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1758

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Cisco IOS Software on Catalyst 6500 Series Switches handles 802.1x packets in the process path. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when a host has already authenticated on a port, and a new, unauthorized host attempts to connect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of 802.1x packets when a new, unauthorized host connects to a port where another host is already authenticated.
- The vulnerability is triggered when specific 802.1x configurations are in place:
  - `authentication host-mode multi-domain` is enabled on the interface.
  - `authentication violation restrict` is configured.
  - The interface is not in `authentication open` mode (i.e., it's in closed authentication mode).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can gain intermittent, unauthorized access to the network prior to successful authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Adjacent network access is required.
- An attacker needs to connect to an 802.1x configured port on a vulnerable switch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the adjacent network.
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to an 802.1x configured port on the targeted Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switch running vulnerable Cisco IOS software with specific configurations.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a new, unauthorized host attempts to connect to a port where a host is already authenticated.
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches running vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS Software.
- The vulnerability is not present if the port is configured with `authentication violation shutdown|protect`.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability.
- Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software are not affected.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.7 (Medium) with vector `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N`.
