"text": "A vulnerability in 802.1x function of Cisco IOS Software on the Catalyst 6500 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access the network prior to authentication.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to how the 802.1x packets are handled in the process path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the network on an 802.1x configured port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to intermittently obtain access to the network.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-c6500 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-c6500\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software if the 802.1x feature is enabled with authentication host-mode being multi-domain, authentication violation being restrict, and in closed authentication mode on a given interface.\r\n\r\nFor information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nAssessing the 802.1x Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the 802.1x feature is configured in a manner that makes a device vulnerable, perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nAdministrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include multi-domain command in the CLI to check for the presence of the authentication host-mode multi-domain command in the interface configuration. If the command returns no output, the device is not vulnerable. If the command returns output, identify all the interfaces with the authentication host-mode multi-domain command present and proceed to the next step.\r\nFor each interface identified in the previous step, administrators can use the show running-config command in the CLI to check for the presence of authentication open. For each interface where the authentication mode is configured as open, the device on that interface is not vulnerable. For all other interfaces, complete the next step.\r\nFor each interface identified in the previous steps, administrators can use the show running-config command in the CLI to check for the presence of authentication violation restrict. If this command is present, the interface is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe following shows an example of an AFFECTED configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet1/4/1\r\n switchport switchport switchport access vlan 100 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 101 authentication event fail action next-method authentication event server dead action authorize voice authentication event server alive action reinitialize authentication host-mode multi-domain authentication order dot1x mab authentication priority dot1x mab authentication port-control auto authentication periodic authentication timer reauthenticate server authentication violation restrict mab dot1x pae authenticator dot1x timeout tx-period 2 spanning-tree portfast edge spanning-tree bpduguard enable\r\n\r\nThe following shows an example of a NON-AFFECTED configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet1/4/1\r\n switchport switchport switchport access vlan 100 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 101 authentication event fail action next-method authentication event server dead action authorize voice authentication event server alive action reinitialize authentication host-mode multi-domain authentication open authentication order dot1x mab authentication priority dot1x mab authentication port-control auto authentication periodic authentication timer reauthenticate server authentication violation shutdown mab dot1x pae authenticator dot1x timeout tx-period 2 spanning-tree portfast edge spanning-tree bpduguard enable\r\n Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

"text": "For detailed information about affected and fixed software releases, consult the Cisco IOS Software Checker.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2���in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the Impact Rating drop-down list."

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Catalyst 6500 Series 802.1x Authentication Bypass Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190327-c6500  First Published: 2019 March 27 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [Yes](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvk25074](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvk25074)     CVE-2019-1758     CWE-287       CVSS Score: [Base 4.7](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-1758     CWE-287       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-c6500/csaf/cisco-sa-20190327-c6500.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in 802.1x function of Cisco IOS Software on the Catalyst 6500 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access the network prior to authentication.  The vulnerability is due to how the 802.1x packets are handled in the process path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the network on an 802.1x configured port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to intermittently obtain access to the network.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software if the 802.1x feature is enabled with **authentication host-mode** being **multi-domain**, **authentication violation** being **restrict**,and in **closed authentication mode** on a given interface.  For information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Assessing the 802.1x Configuration**  To determine whether the 802.1x feature is configured in a manner that makes a device vulnerable, perform the following tasks:    1. Administrators can log in to the device and use the **show running-config | include multi-domain** command in the CLI to check for the presence of the **authentication host-mode multi-domain** command in the interface configuration. If the command returns no output, the device is *not* vulnerable. If the command returns output, identify all the interfaces with the **authentication host-mode multi-domain** command present and proceed to the next step.   2. For each interface identified in the previous step, administrators can use the **show running-config** command in the CLI to check for the presence of **authentication open****.** For each interface where the **authentication mode** is configured as ***open***, the device on that interface is *not* vulnerable.For all other interfaces, complete the next step.   3. For each interface identified in the previous steps, administrators can use the **show running-config** command in the CLI to check for the presence of **authentication violation restrict****.** If this command is present, the interface is vulnerable. The following shows an example of an AFFECTED configuration:  ```   interface GigabitEthernet1/4/1    switchport    switchport    switchport access vlan 100    switchport mode access    switchport voice vlan 101    authentication event fail action next-method    authentication event server dead action authorize voice    authentication event server alive action reinitialize   authentication host-mode multi-domain    authentication order dot1x mab    authentication priority dot1x mab    authentication port-control auto    authentication periodic    authentication timer reauthenticate server    authentication violation restrict    mab    dot1x pae authenticator    dot1x timeout tx-period 2    spanning-tree portfast edge    spanning-tree bpduguard enable   ```  The following shows an example of a NON-AFFECTED configuration:  ```   interface GigabitEthernet1/4/1    switchport    switchport    switchport access vlan 100    switchport mode access    switchport voice vlan 101    authentication event fail action next-method    authentication event server dead action authorize voice    authentication event server alive action reinitialize   authentication host-mode multi-domain    authentication open    authentication order dot1x mab    authentication priority dot1x mab    authentication port-control auto    authentication periodic    authentication timer reauthenticate server    authentication violation shutdown    mab    dot1x pae authenticator    dot1x timeout tx-period 2    spanning-tree portfast edge    spanning-tree bpduguard enable   ``` Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to *Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software* or *Cisco IOS Software*. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of *C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   Router> show version      Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * This vulnerability could be exploited when a host has already authenticated on the affected configured port and a new host in unauthorized mode tries to connect. The impact is intermittent access to the network prior to authentication.  Workarounds  * If the port is also configured with either **authentication violation *shutdown|protect***, this vulnerability would not be exploitable.  Fixed Software  * For detailed information about affected and fixed software releases, consult the Cisco IOS Software Checker.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.          Cisco IOS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2**-in the following field:       By default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the **Impact Rating** drop-down list.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  Source  * This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 4.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 4.7 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 4.7 |
