Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1936:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface when changing the password for the 'scpuser'. Specifically, the password input is passed directly to `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command injection (CWE-78):** The application takes user-supplied input (password for scpuser) and executes it as part of a shell command, allowing for arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote code execution as root:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux shell with root privileges. This allows for complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the web interface.
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted request to a specific part of the web interface responsible for changing the scpuser password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authentication:** Exploitation requires a valid, authenticated session to the web interface, which could be obtained by exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2019-1937) or through valid administrative credentials.
*   **Privileged access:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the vulnerable configuration.
*   **Network access:** Attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device.

**Technical details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in the `com.cloupia.feature.cimc.forms.SCPUserConfigurationForm` class, specifically in the `doFormSubmit()` method.
*   The method takes user-provided password data (`FIELD_ID_PASSWORD`) and constructs a shell command using it:
   `/bin/sh -c echo -e "$password\n$password" | (passwd --stdin scpuser)`
*  The lack of input sanitization on the `password` variable allows command injection.
* A Metasploit module has been developed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   A sample payload for achieving a reverse shell is provided.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco UCS Director, Cisco Integrated Management Controller Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco IMC Supervisor releases 2.2.1.0 and later, Cisco UCS Director releases 6.7.2.0 and later (recommended: 6.7.3.0), and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data releases 3.7.2.0 and later (recommended: 3.7.3.0).
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to a patched version.
