{
  "CVE-2019-1989": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from a failure to signal the IVD_RES_CHANGED event when crop parameters are changed during video decoding. Specifically, display dimensions could change without a corresponding change in the decoded dimensions. If the output buffer is allocated based on the current decoded dimension and a smaller buffer is allocated because of the change, an out-of-bounds write can occur when the new buffer is smaller than the frame being returned as output.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper signaling of IVD_RES_CHANGED event",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted video file can trigger the vulnerability during decoding.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted video file."
