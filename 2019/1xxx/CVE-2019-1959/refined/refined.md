Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the improper input validation of arguments used with a vulnerable CLI command in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper input validation, specifically when handling arguments passed to a CLI command. This allows for the injection of malicious arguments.
*   Arbitrary file read vulnerability, meaning an attacker can access files that they should not normally have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information, configuration data, or other critical files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required.
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to execute CLI commands.
*   The attack involves using a crafted argument during the execution of a vulnerable CLI command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have valid credentials for a local account on the affected Cisco Enterprise NFVIS device.
*   The attacker must be able to execute CLI commands on the affected device.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper input sanitization within a CLI command, which allows a local, authenticated user to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system by providing crafted arguments. This poses a risk of unauthorized information disclosure.
