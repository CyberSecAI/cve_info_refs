Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1977:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by improper endpoint learning in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches running in ACI mode. Specifically, when "Disable Remote Endpoint Learning" is enabled, the switch may incorrectly create a Remote (XR) entry for an endpoint when packets are received from outside the ACI fabric on a specific port and destined for an endpoint on a border leaf. This XR entry becomes stale if the endpoint moves to another port or leaf switch.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Endpoint Learning:** The core issue is the incorrect creation of Remote (XR) entries when "Disable Remote Endpoint Learning" is enabled. This leads to stale entries that hinder traffic forwarding.
- **Stale Remote Entries:** If the endpoint migrates, the stale XR entry prevents traffic from reaching the endpoint until the entry is relearned, resulting in a DoS condition.
- **Lack of Proper Handling of Remote Endpoints:** The system fails to properly handle and relearn remote endpoint locations in the mentioned scenario, even after endpoint movement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. The impacted endpoint becomes unreachable because the switch does not forward traffic due to the stale XR entry. The endpoint remains unreachable until the switch learns a correct remote entry via an alternate mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Specific Packet Flow:** The attack involves sending packets from outside the ACI fabric to a specific port and destined for an endpoint on a border leaf.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches. They must be able to send packets to the affected ports of the device.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability, they can send crafted packets remotely.
- **Knowledge of the Network Topology:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the network, specifically the affected border leaf and its endpoints.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is present when the 'Disable Remote Endpoint Learning' feature is enabled.
- There are no workarounds available that address this vulnerability; the only solution is to apply the software updates.
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches running in ACI mode.
- The exploit complexity is rated "High".
