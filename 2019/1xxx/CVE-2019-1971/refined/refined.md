Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation by the web portal framework of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-78): The web portal framework does not properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution with root privileges.
- Complete compromise of the affected system.
- Potential for data theft, system manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Exploitation via the web portal, specifically during authentication.
- Malicious input provided to the vulnerable web portal framework.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web portal.
- No prior authentication is needed.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious input.

**Additional Details:**

- Vulnerable Products: Cisco Enterprise NFVIS releases 3.6.2 through 3.8.1.
