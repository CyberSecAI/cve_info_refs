**Title:** Cisco Directory Connector Search Order Hijacking Vulnerability

**CVE Description:** A vulnerability in the search path processing of Cisco Directory Connector could allow an authenticated, local attacker to load a binary of their choosing.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled search path elements.

**Weakness:** Uncontrolled search path elements.

**Attack Vector:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a binary of their choosing earlier in the search path utilized by Cisco Directory Connector to locate and load required resources.

**Impact:** An authenticated, local attacker can load a binary of their choosing. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially with elevated privileges.

**Required Capabilities:**
*   The attacker must be authenticated and have local access to the system running Cisco Directory Connector.
*   The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious binary in a location that is earlier in the search path than the intended legitimate binary.

**Affected Products:** Cisco Directory Connector.

**Workaround:** To ensure that supporting dynamic link libraries (DLLs) are loaded from system locations prior to the user's current working directory, an administrator can verify SafeDLLSearchMode is enabled in the Windows Registry.

**Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
