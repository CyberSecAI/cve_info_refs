Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the log subscription subsystem of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA). This lack of input sanitization is present in both the web and command-line interfaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject scripting commands due to the inadequate input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*   **Root Access:** The attacker can elevate their privileges to root, gaining full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Cisco WSA.
*   **Web or CLI Interface:**  The injection can be performed through either the web interface or the command-line interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be present on the same network or have local access to the device.
*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the Cisco WSA.
*   **Technical Understanding:** The attacker needs to understand how to inject malicious scripting commands within the log subscription subsystem.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-1816 is a command injection vulnerability in the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) that allows a local, authenticated attacker to gain root privileges. This is achieved by injecting malicious scripting commands via either the web or command-line interface, due to insufficient input validation in the log subscription subsystem.
