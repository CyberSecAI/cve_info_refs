Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-1559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in how OpenSSL handles 0-byte records during the `SSL_shutdown()` process after a fatal protocol error has occurred. Specifically, a discrepancy arises between how invalid padding and an invalid MAC are handled for these records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Padding Oracle:** A padding oracle vulnerability is present where the application's differing response to invalid padding versus an invalid MAC in a 0-byte record can be detected by a remote attacker. This can be used to decrypt the data.
*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The vulnerability arises because OpenSSL may behave differently depending on whether the 0-byte record has invalid padding versus an invalid MAC when `SSL_shutdown()` is called twice after a fatal error.
*   **Non-Stitched Ciphersuites:** The vulnerability is only exploitable when "non-stitched" ciphersuites are used. These are older ciphersuites for which optimized implementations (stitched) are not used.
*  **Specific API usage:** Application must call `SSL_shutdown()` twice after a fatal error for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Decryption:** A remote attacker can potentially decrypt data by exploiting the padding oracle, by sending specifically crafted 0-byte records with either invalid padding or MAC and observing the difference in response times or errors.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  The vulnerability can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data transmitted over an encrypted channel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** A remote attacker who is able to send specially crafted data over an encrypted connection is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Specific conditions:** The attack requires specific conditions such as the use of non-stitched ciphersuites and the use of the `SSL_shutdown()` API twice after a protocol error in the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending network traffic to a vulnerable server
*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker needs to be able to discern differences in the application's response to invalid padding and MAC checks, potentially through timing analysis. This may require local access or a fast network connection.
*   **Control over Client Behavior**: The attacker must be able to control the client-side to send requests that trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability does not impact OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.1.0.
*   OpenSSL versions 1.0.2 through 1.0.2q are vulnerable and should be upgraded to 1.0.2r or later to patch this vulnerability.
* AEAD ciphersuites are not vulnerable to this issue.
