Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to correctly track the number of bytes remaining in a buffer when indexing file data during the scanning of PDF documents. This improper handling of data leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds heap read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Improper Data Handling:** A lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while indexing remaining file data

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit causes a heap buffer out-of-bounds read condition, leading to a crash of the application and a denial of service condition on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted PDF files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing maliciously crafted PDF documents.
- **Remote, unauthenticated:** An attacker can send the malicious PDF file remotely and does not need authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send files:** The attacker needs the ability to send the crafted PDF file to a system running a vulnerable version of ClamAV.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in ClamAV versions 0.101.1 and prior, specifically related to the PDF scanning functionality.
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely without requiring any authentication.
- The vulnerability was identified and reported by the Google OSS-Fuzz project.
- SUSE rates this as an important security issue.
- Both CVSS v2 and v3 scores are provided, with differences in access complexity and scope between the NVD and SUSE ratings.
- The vulnerability is addressed in ClamAV versions 0.100.3 and 0.101.2 (and later versions), depending on the product.
- Various SUSE and openSUSE products are affected, with patches available.
