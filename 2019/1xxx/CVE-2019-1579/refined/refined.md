CVE-2019-1579:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper input validation leading to a format string vulnerability in the `sslmgr` daemon of Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interface. The daemon searches for the string `scep-profile-name` and passes its value as the `snprintf` format, leading to the format string attack.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Format string vulnerability
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/sslmgr` endpoint with a malicious `scep-profile-name` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Unauthenticated network access to the GlobalProtect portal or gateway interface.
- Affected versions: PAN-OS 7.1.18 and earlier, PAN-OS 8.0.11-h1 and earlier, and PAN-OS 8.1.2 and earlier releases. PAN-OS 9.0 is not affected.
