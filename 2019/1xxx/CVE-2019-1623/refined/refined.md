Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1623:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation during the execution of a vulnerable CLI command within the Cisco Meeting Server's CLI configuration shell.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The system fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input to the vulnerable CLI command, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with *root* privileges.
- Full System Compromise: Gaining *root* access allows the attacker complete control over the compromised system, potentially leading to data breaches, denial-of-service, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Attack Vector: The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable Cisco Meeting Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker must have administrator-level credentials to use the CLI.
- Local Access: The attacker needs to be able to access the CLI locally on the affected device.

**Summary**
CVE-2019-1623 describes a command injection vulnerability in the Cisco Meeting Server CLI. An attacker with administrator-level privileges and local access can inject arbitrary commands that will execute as root, leading to a full system compromise.
