{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation on the web interface of Cisco Expressway Series.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could bypass security restrictions and access the web interface of a Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) associated with the affected device. This could potentially allow the attacker to read or modify sensitive information via these interfaces. Note: Valid credentials would still be required to access the CUCM interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of the Cisco Expressway Series.",
       "Inserting repeated occurrences of \"/..;/\" into the URL."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated, remote attacker with valid credentials to access the Cisco Expressway Gateway.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability leverages the methodology described in “Breaking Parser Logic” by Orange Tsai. The CUCM service, implemented using Tomcat, interprets URLs differently than the upstream reverse proxy, Cisco Expressway Gateway."
