## Directory Traversal in Cisco Expressway Gateway

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
Cisco Expressway which enables access to administrative web interfaces.

### Details

* Product: Cisco Expressway Gateway
* Affected Versions: 11.5.1, possibly others
* Fixed Versions: See Cisco Bug ID CSCvo47769 (<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo47769>)
* Vulnerability Type: Directory Traversal
* Security Risk: medium
* Vendor URL: `https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-expressway-traversal`
* Vendor Status: fixed version released
* Vendor ID: Cisco Bug ID CSCvo47769
* Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-002`
* Advisory Status: published
* CVE: CVE-2019-1854
* CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1854`

### Introduction

“Cisco Expressway offers users outside your firewall simple, highly
secure access to all collaboration workloads, including video, voice,
content, IM, and presence. Collaborate with people who are on
third-party systems and endpoints or in other companies. Help
teleworkers and Cisco Jabber mobile users work more effectively on their
device of choice.”
(from the Cisco Expressway Series website (<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/unified-communications/expressway-series/index.html>))

### More Details

Cisco Expressway Gateway is a kind of reverse proxy which implements
authentication mechanisms and forwards authorised requests to services
based on information encoded within the requested URL. It supports two
different URI layouts. The first layout only includes the base64-encoded
domain name of the gateway itself:

```
https://example.com:8443/$(echo -n example.com|base64)/test123

https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20=/test123

```

The second layout additionally specifies the protocol, hostname and port
number of a target system which is to be contacted through the gateway:

```
https://example.com:8443/$(echo -n example.com/https/example.int/8443|base64)/test123

https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw==/test123

```

RedTeam Pentesting analysed a Cisco Unified Communication Manager (CUCM)
instance which was accessible via a Cisco Expressway Gateway. In this
configuration, a directory traversal vulnerability was identified. It
leverages the methodology described in “Breaking Parser Logic” (<https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2026/DEF%20CON%2026%20presentations/DEFCON-26-Orange-Tsai-Breaking-Parser-Logic-Take-Your-Path-Normalization-Off-and-Pop-0days-Out-Updated.pdf>) by
Orange Tsai. The CUCM service, which is implemented using the Tomcat (<https://tomcat.apache.org>)
application server, interprets URLs different to the upstream
reverse proxy. By accessing a specially crafted URL, attackers can
access the CUCM manager application, even though it is not exposed by
the Cisco Expressway Gateway.

### Proof of Concept

First, an attacker must authenticate to the Cisco Expressway Gateway.
A login can be performed by accessing the following URL using
HTTP-Basic-Authentication:

```
https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20=/get_edge_config

```

Afterwards, the resources on the CUCM may be accessed through the Cisco
Expressway Gateway. By inserting repeated occurrences of “/..;/” into
the URL, the directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited. Using
the following URL, a list of applications installed on the CUCM system
can be retrieved:

```
https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw==/cucm-uds/user/example_user/..;/..;/..;/

```

Similarly, the CUCM manager application can be accessed as follows:

```
https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw==/cucm-uds/user/example_user/..;/..;/..;/ccmadmin

```
### Workaround

Prevent access to the Cisco Expressway Gateway by untrusted parties.

### Fix

See Cisco Bug ID CSCvo47769 (<https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo47769>) for affected software releases and
available patches.

### Security Risk

The vulnerability can be used to access administrative interfaces which
are usually not reachable. Attackers could potentially read or modify
sensitive information via these interfaces. However, it is necessary to
have an authorised user account to access the Cisco Expressway Gateway.
Therefore, the vulnerability poses a medium risk.

### Timeline

Advisory: Directory Traversal in Cisco Expressway Gateway

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
Cisco Expressway which enables access to administrative web interfaces.

Details
=======

Product: Cisco Expressway Gateway
Affected Versions: 11.5.1, possibly others
Fixed Versions: See Cisco Bug ID CSCvo47769 [1]
Vulnerability Type: Directory Traversal
Security Risk: medium
Vendor URL: <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-expressway-traversal>
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Vendor ID: Cisco Bug ID CSCvo47769
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-002>
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1854
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1854>

Introduction
============

"Cisco Expressway offers users outside your firewall simple, highly
secure access to all collaboration workloads, including video, voice,
content, IM, and presence. Collaborate with people who are on
third-party systems and endpoints or in other companies. Help
teleworkers and Cisco Jabber mobile users work more effectively on their
device of choice."
(from the Cisco Expressway Series website [2])

More Details
============

Cisco Expressway Gateway is a kind of reverse proxy which implements
authentication mechanisms and forwards authorised requests to services
based on information encoded within the requested URL. It supports two
different URI layouts. The first layout only includes the base64-encoded
domain name of the gateway itself:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://example.com:8443/$](https://example.com:8443/%24)(echo -n example.com|base64)/test123

[https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20=/test123](https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20%3D/test123)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The second layout additionally specifies the protocol, hostname and port
number of a target system which is to be contacted through the gateway:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://example.com:8443/$](https://example.com:8443/%24)(echo -n example.com/https/example.int/8443|base64)/test123

[https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw==/test123](https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw%3D%3D/test123)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

RedTeam Pentesting analysed a Cisco Unified Communication Manager (CUCM)
instance which was accessible via a Cisco Expressway Gateway. In this
configuration, a directory traversal vulnerability was identified. It
leverages the methodology described in "Breaking Parser Logic" [3] by
Orange Tsai. The CUCM service, which is implemented using the Tomcat [4]
application server, interprets URLs different to the upstream
reverse proxy. By accessing a specially crafted URL, attackers can
access the CUCM manager application, even though it is not exposed by
the Cisco Expressway Gateway.

Proof of Concept
================

First, an attacker must authenticate to the Cisco Expressway Gateway.
A login can be performed by accessing the following URL using
HTTP-Basic-Authentication:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20=/get_edge_config](https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20%3D/get_edge_config)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards, the resources on the CUCM may be accessed through the Cisco
Expressway Gateway. By inserting repeated occurrences of "/..;/" into
the URL, the directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited. Using
the following URL, a list of applications installed on the CUCM system
can be retrieved:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw==/cucm-uds/user/example_user/..;/..;/..;/](https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw%3D%3D/cucm-uds/user/example_user/..%3B/..%3B/..%3B/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, the CUCM manager application can be accessed as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw==/cucm-uds/user/example_user/..;/..;/..;/ccmadmin](https://example.com:8443/ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20vaHR0cHMvZXhhbXBsZS5pbnQvODQ0Mw%3D%3D/cucm-uds/user/example_user/..%3B/..%3B/..%3B/ccmadmin)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workaround
==========

Prevent access to the Cisco Expressway Gateway by untrusted parties.

Fix
===

See Cisco Bug ID CSCvo47769 [1] for affected software releases and
available patches.

Security Risk
=============

The vulnerability can be used to access administrative interfaces which
are usually not reachable. Attackers could potentially read or modify
sensitive information via these interfaces. However, it is necessary to
have an authorised user account to access the Cisco Expressway Gateway.
Therefore, the vulnerability poses a medium risk.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 4.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 4.1 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 4.1 |
