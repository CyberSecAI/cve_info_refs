- Root cause: Incorrect processing of crafted IS-IS link-state protocol data units (PDUs).
- Vulnerability: A vulnerability in the implementation of the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol in Cisco IOS XR Software.
- Impact: An unauthenticated attacker in the same IS-IS area can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by sending a crafted link-state PDU to an affected system, leading to all routers within the IS-IS area unexpectedly restarting the IS-IS process.
- Attack vector: Sending a crafted IS-IS link-state PDU to a vulnerable system.
- Required attacker capabilities:
  - Must be an unauthenticated attacker.
  - Must be in the same IS-IS area.
  - Must be able to send crafted IS-IS link-state PDUs.
