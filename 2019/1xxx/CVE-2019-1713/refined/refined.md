Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1713

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the lack of adequate CSRF protection mechanisms, allowing an attacker to potentially execute unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the victim user.
*   **Configuration Alteration:** If the user possesses administrative privileges, the attacker can alter the device's configuration.
*   **Information Extraction:** Attackers could extract sensitive information from the affected device.
*  **Device Reload:** The attacker could potentially reload the device, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to initiate the attack.
*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker would need to persuade a user of the web-based management interface to click on a malicious link, which triggers the CSRF attack when the user is logged into the interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web-based management interface of the vulnerable ASA device over the network, from an IP address that is in the range configured in the `http` command of the ASA's running configuration.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering tactics to trick the user into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability impacts Cisco ASA Software releases with web management access enabled, specifically versions prior to the fixed releases indicated in the advisory.
*   **Not Affected:** Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software is confirmed not to be affected by this vulnerability.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than updating the ASA software.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.1, indicating a high severity.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified under CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
*  **Cisco Bug ID:** CSCvj34599.
