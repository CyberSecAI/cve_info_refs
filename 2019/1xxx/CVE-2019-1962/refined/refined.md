```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Insufficient validation of TCP packets when processed by the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Insufficient input validation of CFSoIP TCP packets during distribution and synchronization operations.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation could lead to process crashes, resulting in device reload and denial of service (DoS).

Attack vectors:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Fabric Services TCP packet to an affected device. The attack is possible from any node that has IP network connectivity to the management interface of an affected device and cannot occur from the data plane.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious Cisco Fabric Services TCP packet to the management interface of the affected device via IP network connectivity. No authentication is required.
