The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of TCP packets when processed by the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Fabric Services TCP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause process crashes, resulting in a device reload and a DoS condition.  **Note:** There are three distribution methods that can be configured for Cisco Fabric Services. This vulnerability affects only distribution method CFSoIP, which is disabled by default. See the [Details](#dt) section for more information.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link: This advisory is part of the August 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes five Cisco Security Advisories that describe five vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72243).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software with CFSoIP enabled:    + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platform   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects Administrators can display the distribution status of Cisco Fabric Services for a device by using the **show cfs status** command in the device CLI, as shown in the following example:  ```   switch# show cfs status   Distribution : Enabled   Distribution over IP : Disabled   IPv4 multicast address : 239.255.70.83   IPv6 multicast address : ff15::efff:4653   Distribution over Ethernet : Disabled      ```  In the preceding example, the *Enabled* value in the **Distribution** field of the command output indicates that Cisco Fabric Services is enabled for the device and the device is configured to use the default Cisco Fabric Services distribution type, which is CFSoFC. The *Disabled* value in the **Distribution over IP** field and the **Distribution over Ethernet** field indicates that the device is not configured to use the CFSoIP and CFSoE distribution types.  For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * Cisco Fabric Services provides a common infrastructure for distributing and synchronizing configuration data between Cisco devices that are on the same network and with virtual port channels (vPCs). This includes configuration data for applications and features that are compatible with and enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services-for example, Distributed Device Alias Services, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and user and administrator roles. To distribute and synchronize data, Cisco Fabric Services can be configured to use any of the following distribution types:  **Cisco Fabric Services over Fiber Channel (CFSoFC)**-Distributes data over a Fiber Channel (FC), such as a virtual storage area network (VSAN). CFSoFC distribution is enabled by default.  **Cisco Fabric Services over Ethernet (CFSoE)**-Distributes data over an Ethernet network. For vPC support, Cisco Fabric Services must be configured to use this distribution type. CFSoE distribution is disabled by default.  **Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP)**-Distributes data over an IPv4 or IPv6 network. CFSoIP distribution is disabled by default.  **Note:** The vulnerability described in this advisory is due to insufficient input validation that could occur when the affected software processes CFSoIP TCP packets received during distribution and synchronization operations. An attack is possible from any node that has IP network connectivity to the management interface of an affected device and cannot occur from the data plane.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |

"title": "Summary",
"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause process crashes, which can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of TCP packets when processed by the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Fabric Services TCP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause process crashes, resulting in a device reload and a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote: There are three distribution methods that can be configured for Cisco Fabric Services. This vulnerability affects only distribution method CFSoIP, which is disabled by default. See the Details [\"#dt\"] section for more information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nxos-fsip-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nxos-fsip-dos\"]\r\n This advisory is part of the August 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes five Cisco Security Advisories that describe five vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: August 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72243\"]."

"text": "Cisco Fabric Services provides a common infrastructure for distributing and synchronizing configuration data between Cisco devices that are on the same network and with virtual port channels (vPCs). This includes configuration data for applications and features that are compatible with and enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services���for example, Distributed Device Alias Services, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and user and administrator roles. To distribute and synchronize data, Cisco Fabric Services can be configured to use any of the following distribution types:\r\n\r\nCisco Fabric Services over Fiber Channel (CFSoFC)���Distributes data over a Fiber Channel (FC), such as a virtual storage area network (VSAN). CFSoFC distribution is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nCisco Fabric Services over Ethernet (CFSoE)���Distributes data over an Ethernet network. For vPC support, Cisco Fabric Services must be configured to use this distribution type. CFSoE distribution is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nCisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP)���Distributes data over an IPv4 or IPv6 network. CFSoIP distribution is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nNote: The vulnerability described in this advisory is due to insufficient input validation that could occur when the affected software processes CFSoIP TCP packets received during distribution and synchronization operations. An attack is possible from any node that has IP network connectivity to the management interface of an affected device and cannot occur from the data plane."
