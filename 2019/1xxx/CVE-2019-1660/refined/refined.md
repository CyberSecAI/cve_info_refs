Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the implementation of a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface in Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) software. This interface, by design, allows unauthenticated access to web services intended for device management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The primary vulnerability is that the SOAP interface allows access without requiring any authentication. This means that anyone with network access to the service can interact with the management features.
*   **Undocumented Feature:** At the time of initial publication, the specific management features exposed through the SOAP interface were not documented. This lack of documentation could lead to unknown risks and potential misconfigurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The provided information indicates that while the interface was accessible without authentication, the exact impact of this was not immediately clear, as the feature was undocumented. The advisory mentions that this may represent "unknown risks to customers." While it does not provide specific impacts, the description indicates that it exposes management features, which implies the possibility of unauthorized changes to devices, configuration changes, or potential service disruption.

The CVSS score is 0.0 because there is no confidentiality, integrity, or availability impact by design. This is not a vulnerability that allows an attacker to take unauthorized actions, but rather that it was originally an undocumented feature.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based. Any attacker with network access to the Cisco TMS server can access the vulnerable SOAP interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Cisco TMS server.
*   **No Authentication:** No specific authentication or authorization is needed to access the SOAP interface, making it easily exploitable if accessible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory emphasizes that the vulnerability was not publicly announced nor exploited maliciously at the time of the advisory's release.
*   The advisory provides a link to the Cisco TMS Admin Guide (page 18) for more information on the exposed management feature, implying that this was an intended but initially undocumented feature.
*   There were no workarounds to address this, indicating that users must upgrade their software to mitigate any potential risks.

In summary, CVE-2019-1660 involves an unauthenticated SOAP interface in Cisco TMS that exposed management features, which were initially undocumented, thus posing unknown risks. The advisory was created to inform users of this design and provide a reference to the feature documentation.
