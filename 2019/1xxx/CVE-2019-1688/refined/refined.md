Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the password management system of the Cisco Network Assurance Engine (NAE). Specifically, new installations of NAE Release 3.0(1) are affected by a default administrator password. Additionally, passwords changed via the web management interface are not properly synchronized with the CLI, leaving the old password active for CLI access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use of a default administrator password in new installations of NAE 3.0(1)
- Lack of password synchronization between web interface and CLI, leading to old passwords still being valid for CLI access.
- CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the system via the CLI.
- Viewing of potentially sensitive information.
- Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) condition by bringing the server down.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the affected server's CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the server to use the CLI.
- The attacker must know or use the default administrator password if it has not been changed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects *new* installations of NAE Release 3.0(1).
- Upgrades from earlier versions are not directly affected.
- The vulnerability is addressed in NAE Release 3.0(1a).
-  A workaround is available by changing the default password from the CLI using the `passwd` command (with assistance from Cisco TAC).
- The CVSS v3 base score is 7.7 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H
