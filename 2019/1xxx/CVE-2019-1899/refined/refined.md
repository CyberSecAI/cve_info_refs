Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper authorization** of HTTP requests to the web interface of Cisco RV110W, RV130W, and RV215W routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain a list of devices connected to the guest network.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The web interface doesn't properly restrict access to the connected device information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Device Information:** An attacker can learn the MAC addresses, IP addresses, and potentially hostnames of all devices connected to the router's guest network. This information can be used for further reconnaissance or targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:** Attackers send a specially crafted HTTP request to a specific URI on the router's web interface.
