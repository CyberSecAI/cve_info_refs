**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1385

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the AppX Deployment service in Microsoft Windows. It stems from the service's handling of hard links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the ability of an attacker to create a hard link that the AppX Deployment service can be tricked into following. This allows the attacker to overwrite the content of a file of their choosing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system. The attacker can overwrite system files leading to instability or inoperability. The vulnerability can also be used for limited information tampering.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local. The attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target Windows system. This implies prior access or the successful exploitation of another vulnerability to gain initial access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as a "Hard Link Denial-of-Service Vulnerability"
- Microsoft has released a patch to address the flaw.
- The vulnerability was reported by kkokkokye@THEORI.
- The CVSS score is 6.1 with a vector of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H. This indicates a local attack with low privilege requirements and impact limited to low integrity and high availability.
