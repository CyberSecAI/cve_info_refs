Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of command-line interface (CLI) arguments in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS). Specifically, the software fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input to CLI commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the susceptibility to path traversal attacks. By manipulating CLI command arguments with directory traversal techniques (e.g., using `../`), an attacker can access files and directories outside the intended scope.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The root cause is insufficient input validation in the CLI, allowing the path traversal to be successful.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the affected device, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device, which could lead to system compromise, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device. This implies they are either physically present or have network access that allows them to interact with the device's CLI.
*   **CLI:** The vulnerability is exploited through the device's command-line interface. The attacker needs to execute vulnerable commands, crafted with path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs valid administrator-level credentials to access the device's CLI and execute the vulnerable commands. This means the vulnerability is not exploitable by unauthenticated users or users with lower-level privileges.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires a local presence or network access that permits the usage of the CLI, which is essential for exploiting this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

In summary, CVE-2019-1952 is a path traversal vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Enterprise NFVIS due to improper input validation. An attacker with local, administrative access can read or overwrite arbitrary files by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability affects Cisco Enterprise NFVIS devices running software releases earlier than Release 3.10.1.
* There are no workarounds available.
* Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability (fixed in release 3.10.1 and later).
* The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 (Medium severity) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
