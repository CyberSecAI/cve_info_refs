{
  "CVE-2019-1573": {
    "Root cause": "The GlobalProtect App for Windows and macOS stores authentication and session tokens insecurely in memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure (CWE-200)",
      "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311)"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local authenticated attacker with the ability to inspect memory can access authentication and session tokens. These tokens can be replayed to spoof a VPN session and gain access as the user, bypassing other authentication methods and accessing the same applications as the user.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the user's machine.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have already compromised the end-user account, have local access to the machine, and have the ability to inspect memory."
