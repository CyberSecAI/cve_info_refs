### Description

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the GlobalProtect App for Windows and macOS (VU#192371).

Successful exploitation of this issue would allow a local authenticated attacker to access authentication and/or session tokens and replay them to spoof the VPN session and gain access as the user. An attacker should have already compromised the end user account and gained the ability to inspect memory in order to obtain these tokens.

This issue affects GlobalProtect App 4.1.0 for Windows and GlobalProtect App 4.1.10 and earlier for macOS. GlobalProtect App for macOS 5.0 is NOT affected.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| GlobalProtect App 4.1 | <= 4.1.0 on Windows, <= 4.1.10 on OS X | >= 4.1.1 on Windows, >= 4.1.11 on OS X |

## VPN applications insecurely store session cookies

#### Vulnerability Note VU#192371

Original Release Date: 2019-04-11 | Last Revised: 2019-04-24

---

### Overview

Multiple Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications store the authentication and/or session cookies insecurely in memory and/or log files.

### Description

| Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are used to create a secure connection with another network over the internet. Multiple VPN applications store the authentication and/or session cookies insecurely in memory and/or log files.  [**CWE-311**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html): Missing Encryption of Sensitive DataThe following products and versions store the cookie insecurely in log files:- [**CVE-2019-1573**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1573): Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Agent 4.1.0 for Windows and GlobalProtect Agent 4.1.10 and earlier for macOS0- [**CVE-2019-11213**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11213): Pulse Desktop Client 9.0R2 and earlier and 5.3R6 and earlier; Pulse Connect Secure (for Network Connect customers) 9.0R2 and earlier, 8.3R6 and earlier, and 8.1R13 and earlierThe following products and versions store the cookie insecurely in memory:- [**CVE-2019-1573**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1573): Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect Agent 4.1.0 for Windows and GlobalProtect Agent 4.1.10 and earlier for macOS0- [**CVE-2019-11213**](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11213): Pulse Desktop Client 9.0R2 and earlier and 5.3R6 and earlier; Pulse Connect Secure (for Network Connect customers) 9.0R2 and earlier, 8.3R6 and earlier, and 8.1R13 and earlier- Cisco AnyConnect 4.7.x and priorIt is likely that this configuration is generic to additional VPN applications. If you believe that your organization is vulnerable, please contact CERT/CC at cert@cert.org with the affected products, version numbers, patch information, and self-assigned CVE. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If an attacker has persistent access to a VPN user's endpoint or exfiltrates the cookie using other methods, they can replay the session and bypass other authentication methods. An attacker would then have access to the same applications that the user does through their VPN session. |

### [Cisco](#CHEU-B8XKTT) Affected

Notified:  January 31, 2019  Updated: April 17, 2019

**Statement Date:   February 13, 2019**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We are not aware of any situation where a currently valid session token is written to log files.

The storage of the session cookie within process memory of the client and in cases of clientless sessions the web browser while the sessions are active are not considered to be an unwarranted exposure. These values are required to maintain the operation of the session per design of the feature should session re-establishment be required due to network interruption. We have documented the concerns and the engineering teams will incorporate this feedback into discussions for future design improvements of the Cisco AnyConnect VPN solution.

It should also be noted that all session material stored by both the Client and Clientless solutions are destroyed once the sessions is deliberately terminated by the client.

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### [Zscaler](#MOLR-BBCJ3Y) Not Affected

Updated:  April 18, 2019

**Statement Date:   April 18, 2019**

### Status

Not Affected

### Vendor Statement

Last week, CERT released Vulnerability Note VU#192371 to highlight that authentication and/or session cookies that are stored insecurely in memory and/or log files can be potentially used in a replay attack. The use of hardware fingerprinting, client certificates, and SAML assertions in Zscaler App make it impractical to replay authentication session cookies obtained from memory and use these on another system.

In addition, no personal or confidential information is stored in the Zscaler App logs.

Zscaler App is not vulnerable to the replay attack as described under Vulnerability Note VU#192371.

Validated on Zscaler App v1.5 and earlier versions

About Zscaler App

The Zscaler App automatically forwards user traffic to the Zscaler cloud and ensures that security and access policies are enforced, regardless of device, location or application. The app automatically determines if a user is looking to access the open internet, a SaaS app or an internal app running in public, private or the datacenter and routes traffic through the appropriate Zscaler security service. The client supports both Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) as well as Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) by default, allowing teams to combine best in class internet security with zero trust access to internal apps.

CVE-2019-1573

Summary

Security Advisory ID : BSA-2019-783

Component : VPN

Revision : 1.0: Final

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are used to create a secure connection with another network over the internet. Multiple VPN applications store the authentication and/or session cookies insecurely in memory and/or log files.

Impact

If an attacker has persistent access to a VPN user's endpoint or exfiltrates the cookie using other methods, they can replay the session and bypass other authentication methods. An attacker would then have access to the same applications that the user does through their VPN session.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found at: https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/192371/

**Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable**

No Brocade Fibre Channel technology products from Broadcom are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
