CVE-2019-1659
```

- **Vulnerability:** Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) has a vulnerability in its Identity Services Engine (ISE) integration feature.
- **Root Cause:** Improper validation of the server SSL certificate when establishing the SSL tunnel between ISE and PI.
- **Attack Vector:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack against the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tunnel established between ISE and PI. The attacker uses a crafted SSL certificate.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to intercept communications between the ISE and PI. This could allow the attacker to view and alter potentially sensitive information that the ISE maintains about clients connected to the network.
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Prime Infrastructure Software Releases 2.2 through 3.4.0 when the PI server is integrated with ISE.
- **Remediation:** Cisco released a software update in Cisco Prime Infrastructure Software Release 3.5 to address this vulnerability.
