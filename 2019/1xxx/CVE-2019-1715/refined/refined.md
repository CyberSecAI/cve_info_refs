Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1715:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient entropy in the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), also known as a Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), used by Cisco ASA and FTD software when generating cryptographic keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Low Entropy:** The DRBG doesn't produce sufficiently random numbers, leading to predictable patterns in the generated keys. This is a weakness in the cryptographic key generation process.
- **Cryptographic Collision:** Due to the low entropy, there's an increased probability of cryptographic key collisions (i.e. different devices generating the same key).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Private Key Discovery:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by generating numerous cryptographic keys on an affected device. Then, they search for collisions with the keys from target devices.
- **Impersonation:** A successful attack allows the attacker to impersonate an affected target device.
- **Decryption:** An attacker could decrypt traffic secured with an affected key going to or from a target device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication.
- **Key Generation:** The attacker doesn't directly target the devices, but exploits predictable keys generated during standard operations of the vulnerable devices.
- **Collision Search:** The attacker needs to generate a large number of cryptographic keys to look for collisions with the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to devices running vulnerable Cisco ASA or FTD software.
- **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs sufficient computing power to generate a large number of cryptographic keys and search for collisions.
- **Knowledge of Affected Devices:** The attacker needs to know the targets are running affected software versions and/or are using vulnerable configurations (trustpoints based on RSA or ECDSA keys, or RSA keys for SSH access generated on the vulnerable system).

**Affected Products (specifically vulnerable configurations):**
- Cisco ASA Software Releases 9.8 or 9.9
- Cisco FTD Software Releases 6.2.1, 6.2.2, or 6.2.3
- Devices running other releases of Cisco ASA or FTD software with the following:
    - Trustpoint based on RSA or ECDSA key pair generated on an affected release
    - RSA key pair for SSH access generated on an affected release
- Specific features utilizing vulnerable key generation:
    - ASDM
    - AnyConnect SSL VPN
    - Cisco Security Manager
    - Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN)
    - IKEv1 and IKEv2 VPN using certificate authentication
    - Local Certificate Authority (CA)
    - Mobile Device Manager (MDM) Proxy
    - Mobile User Security (MUS)
    - Proxy Bypass
    - REST API
    - SSH Access
    - HTTP Service (FTD)

**Workarounds:**
- Generate key pairs and certificates on a trusted device outside the ASA/FTD device, then import them via the `crypto ca import pkcs12` command.

**Additional Notes:**
- Devices are only vulnerable during runtime of the affected software if no vulnerable keys are present.
- Fixed releases require administrators to re-generate vulnerable keys.
- The provided CVSS score is 5.3 (Medium) with the vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
