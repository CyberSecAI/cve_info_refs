CVE-2019-1580
```
**Root cause:** Memory corruption vulnerability in PAN-OS.

**Vulnerability:** A remote, unauthenticated user can craft a message to the Secure Shell Daemon (SSHD) and corrupt arbitrary memory. The vulnerability is due to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119).

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to corrupt arbitrary memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vector:** A remote, unauthenticated user crafts a specific message to the SSHD service.

**Affected versions:**
*   PAN-OS 7.1.24 and earlier
*   PAN-OS 8.0.19 and earlier
*   PAN-OS 8.1.9 and earlier
*   PAN-OS 9.0.3 and earlier

**Fixed versions:**
*   PAN-OS 7.1.24-h1 and later
*   PAN-OS 8.0.19-h1 and later
*   PAN-OS 8.1.9-h4 and later
*   PAN-OS 9.0.3-h3 and later

**Mitigation:** Follow best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface to reduce exposure.
