Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of system files when persistent configuration information is read from the file system during system boot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Configuration Handling:** The system does not adequately verify the integrity and validity of system files used for persistent configuration.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** This lack of validation allows for the potential injection of malicious executable files into the configuration storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges at system startup. This gives the attacker complete control over the device.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to complete compromise of the vulnerable device, allowing for data breaches, denial of service, or further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the vulnerable device.
- **Configuration Overwrite:** The attacker must overwrite the persistent configuration storage with malicious executable files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrative Credentials:** The attacker needs valid administrative credentials to authenticate to the device.
- **Local access:** The attacker requires the ability to access the device's local file system to overwrite configuration files.
