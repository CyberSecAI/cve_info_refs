Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1812:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability exists because software digital signatures are not properly verified during the execution of CLI commands in Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper verification of digital signatures.
- Failure to validate the authenticity and integrity of software images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could install a malicious software image on an affected device.
- If the device is also vulnerable to the previously disclosed vulnerability (cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif), the attacker could potentially boot the device with the malicious image.
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, potentially allowing the attacker to control the device, disrupt services, or steal sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the device's CLI (Command Line Interface).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated, local attacker.
- Administrator-level credentials on the affected device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products running vulnerable versions of Cisco NX-OS software, including Nexus 3000, 3600, 9000 (standalone mode), and 9500 R-Series switches.
- A complete fix requires not only software updates but also a proper BIOS version, as outlined in the previously disclosed advisory cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif.
- There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability, and the recommended remediation is to apply the provided software updates.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity with a CVSS base score of 6.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Summary**

This vulnerability allows an attacker with local access and administrative credentials to bypass image signature verification and install a malicious software image on the affected Cisco device. If the device is vulnerable to an older vulnerability it could allow for the booting of a malicious image. This could lead to complete compromise of the device.
