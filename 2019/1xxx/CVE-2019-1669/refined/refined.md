Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-1669:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the data acquisition (DAQ) component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.
- The software improperly manages system memory resources when inspecting network traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper memory management during traffic inspection.
- Lack of proper handling of specific traffic patterns which leads to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Access Control Policies:** An attacker can potentially bypass configured access control policies, allowing unauthorized traffic to pass through.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exhaust system memory, causing the FTD software to fail. This can lead to two scenarios:
    - **Fail Open:** The system ceases to inspect traffic, effectively bypassing security measures.
    - **Fail Closed:** The system becomes unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- The system may require manual intervention to restore normal operation.
- Depletion of memory blocks of size 9344.
- Traffic inspection may cease.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Specific Traffic Patterns:** The attacker exploits this by sending specifically crafted traffic patterns for the software to inspect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special access to the affected system.
- They must be able to send network traffic to the affected device.

**Vulnerable Configuration:**
A vulnerable configuration requires the following:
1.  Access control rules that perform URL filtering or invoke file/malware inspection.
2.  SSL hardware acceleration enabled (default setting).
3.  Access control policy advanced settings that do not specify an associated SSL policy to handle encrypted traffic (default setting).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Release 6.3.0 when running on Firepower 4100 or Firepower 9300 Series Platforms.
- Disabling SSL hardware acceleration mitigates the issue when no SSL policy is applied.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- Exploitation can be detected by monitoring the system memory usage using the `show blocks` command, specifically for a continued decrease in memory blocks of size 9344.
