"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) feature in Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of LDAP packets by an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending an LDAP packet crafted using Basic Encoding Rules (BER) to an affected device. The LDAP packet must have a source IP address of an LDAP server configured on the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxosldap [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxosldap\"]\r\n This advisory is part of the March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 26 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-70757\"]."

For additional information about AAA configuration for FXOS-based devices, customers can refer to the Configuring AAA section [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/fxos201/cli-config/b\_CLI\_ConfigGuide\_FXOS\_201/platform\_settings.html#topic\_105C66CC3C7F4D99B08A413FEF5BCEF4\"] of the Cisco FXOS CLI Configuration Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nfxos# show ldap-server\r\n timeout : 30 port : 0 baseDN : user profile attribute : search filter : cn=$userid use groups : 0 recurse groups : 0 group attribute : memberOf total number of servers : 1 following LDAP servers are configured: ldap1: timeout: 30 port: 389 rootDN: DC=cisco-firepower-aaa1,DC=qalab0,DC=com0,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa2,DC=qalab1,DC=com1,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa3,DC=qalab2,DC=com2,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa4,DC=qalab3,DC=com3,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa5,DC=qalab4,DC=com4,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa6,DC=qalab5,DC=qalab006 enable-ssl: true . . .\r\n Determining the Cisco NX-OS LDAP Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a Nexus device is configured for the LDAP feature, administrators can use the show running-config | include \"ldap-server host\" command from the NX-OS CLI and verify that the feature is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show running-config | include \"ldap-server host\"\r\nldap-server host ...\r\n\r\nFor additional information on NX-OS LDAP configuration, customers can refer to the Configuring LDAP chapter [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/5\_x/nx-os/security/configuration/guide/b\_Cisco\_Nexus\_7000\_NX-OS\_Security\_Configuration\_Guide\_\_Release\_5-x/b\_Cisco\_Nexus\_7000\_NX-OS\_Security\_Configuration\_Guide\_\_Release\_5-x\_chapter\_0111.html#con\_1473592\"] of the Cisco Security Configuration Guide.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco FXOS Software Release\r\nAdministrators can check the release of Cisco FXOS Software that is running on a device by using the following commands in the device CLI or by navigating to the Overview tab in the Admin portal. The following example shows the output of the show version CLI command on a device that is running Cisco FXOS Software Release 2.2(2.14), as identified in the Package-Vers field of the command output:\r\n\r\n\r\nQP4120B1 # scope system\r\nQP4120B1 /system # show version FPRM: Running-Vers: 4.2(2.15) Package-Vers: 2.2(2.14) Activate-Status: Ready\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release\r\nAdministrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.0(3)I5(1):\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show version\r\nCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac Copyright (C) 2002-2016, Cisco and/or its affiliates.

The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of LDAP packets by an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending an LDAP packet crafted using Basic Encoding Rules (BER) to an affected device. The LDAP packet must have a source IP address of an LDAP server configured on the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link: This advisory is part of the March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 26 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-70757).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThese vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco FXOS Software or Cisco NX-OS Software and are configured for remote LDAP authentication:   + Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliance   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7700 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects For information about which Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determining the Cisco FXOS LDAP Configuration To determine whether a Nexus device is configured for LDAP-based authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), administrators can use the **show ldap-server** CLI command. Output after the **following LDAP servers are configured** header indicates that a device is vulnerable. For additional information about AAA configuration for FXOS-based devices, customers can refer to the [Configuring AAA section](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/fxos/fxos201/cli-config/b_CLI_ConfigGuide_FXOS_201/platform_settings.html#topic_105C66CC3C7F4D99B08A413FEF5BCEF4) of the *Cisco FXOS CLI Configuration Guide*.  ```   fxos# show ldap-server     timeout : 30           port : 0         baseDN :   user profile attribute :   search filter : cn=$userid     use groups : 0   recurse groups : 0   group attribute : memberOf   total number of servers : 1       following LDAP servers are configured:       ldap1:           timeout: 30    port: 389    rootDN: DC=cisco-firepower-aaa1,DC=qalab0,DC=com0,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa2,DC=qalab1,DC=com1,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa3,DC=qalab2,DC=com2,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa4,DC=qalab3,DC=com3,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa5,DC=qalab4,DC=com4,DC=cisco-firepower-aaa6,DC=qalab5,DC=qalab006           enable-ssl: true   .   .   .      ``` Determining the Cisco NX-OS LDAP Configuration To determine whether a Nexus device is configured for the LDAP feature, administrators can use the **show running-config | include "ldap-server host"** command from the NX-OS CLI and verify that the feature is enabled.  ```   nxos-switch# show running-config | include "ldap-server host" ldap-server host ...   ```  For additional information on NX-OS LDAP configuration, customers can refer to the [Configuring LDAP chapter](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/5_x/nx-os/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_7000_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide__Release_5-x/b_Cisco_Nexus_7000_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide__Release_5-x_chapter_0111.html#con_1473592) of the *Cisco Security Configuration Guide*.  Determining the Cisco FXOS Software Release Administrators can check the release of Cisco FXOS Software that is running on a device by using the following commands in the device CLI or by navigating to the **Overview** tab in the Admin portal. The following example shows the output of the **show version** CLI command on a device that is running Cisco FXOS Software Release **2.2(2.14)**, as identified in the **Package-Vers** field of the command output:  ```   QP4120B1 # scope system   QP4120B1 /system # show version   FPRM:   Running-Vers: 4.2(2.15)   Package-Vers: 2.2(2.14)   Activate-Status: Ready   ```  Determining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release Administrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the **show version** command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release **7.0(3)I5(1)**:  ```   nxos-switch# show version   Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software   TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac   Copyright (C) 2002-2016, Cisco and/or its affiliates.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |
