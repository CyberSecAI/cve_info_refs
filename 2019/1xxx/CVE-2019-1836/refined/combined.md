"text": "A vulnerability in the system shell for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker to use symbolic links to overwrite system files. These system files may be sensitive and should not be overwritable by non-root users. The attacker would need valid device credentials.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect symbolic link verification of directory paths when they are used in the system shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and providing crafted user input to specific symbolic link CLI commands. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to overwrite system files that should be restricted.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-fabric-traversal [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-fabric-traversal\"]"

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator: Â  Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.5 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.5 |
