Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1836

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by incorrect symbolic link verification of directory paths within the system shell of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches running in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The system shell does not properly validate directory paths when processing symbolic link commands.
- **Symbolic Link Path Traversal:** Attackers can manipulate symbolic links to point to unintended locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Overwrite:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite sensitive system files that should be restricted to root users only.
- **Potential System Compromise:** Overwriting sensitive system files can lead to arbitrary code execution or system compromise, depending on the overwritten files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the device.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid device credentials to authenticate to the system shell.
- **Crafted User Input:** The attacker provides crafted input to specific symbolic link CLI commands to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected Cisco Nexus 9000 series switch in ACI mode.
- They must have the ability to execute commands in the system shell.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects only Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode. Other Nexus series and standalone NX-OS mode are not affected.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
- The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) associated with this vulnerability is CWE-59, which is "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access".
- The CVSS v3 base score is 5.5 (Medium) with vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
