Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1810:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper verification of software digital signatures during the execution of an NX-OS CLI command used in Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Signature Verification:** The core issue is the lack of proper verification of digital signatures of software images when installing via a CLI command. This allows unsigned or maliciously signed images to be accepted.
- **CWE-347** Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Software Installation:** An attacker can install a malicious software image on the affected device.
- **Boot of Malicious Image:** If the device was not previously patched for the vulnerability described in Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot the malicious image, gaining complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device.
- **CLI Command:** The vulnerability is exploited by using a specific NX-OS CLI command to install a software image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with administrator-level credentials.
- **Local Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to access the CLI of the affected device.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches (specific PIDs: N3K-C3164Q, N3K-C3232C)
- Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode (specific PIDs: N9K-C92304QC, N9K-C9232C)
- Vulnerable Cisco NX-OS Software releases:
    - Nexus 3000 Series Switches: 6.1(2)I3(4) - 7.0(3)I3(1)
    - Nexus 9000 Series Switches: 7.0(3)I4(1) - 7.0(3)I4(2)

**Mitigation:**
- **Software Updates:** Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerability. The advisory lists the first fixed releases for each affected PID.
- **BIOS Update:**  A complete fix also requires a proper BIOS update, as detailed in cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing at Cisco.
- The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.7 (Medium severity).
