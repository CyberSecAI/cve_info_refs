Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input by the Cisco Remote PHY Device Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-78): The software fails to properly sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying Linux shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution as the `root` user.
- Complete compromise of the affected system.
- The attacker gains the ability to run any command on the system, leading to potential data breaches, system disruption, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required, meaning the attacker must already have a foothold on the affected device.
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by providing crafted arguments to CLI commands through the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs valid administrator access to the affected Cisco Remote PHY device.
- The attacker has to be able to send crafted CLI commands with malicious arguments to the affected device.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows a local, authenticated attacker with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary commands as root on a vulnerable Cisco Remote PHY device. This is achieved through command injection by exploiting the software's failure to sanitize user-provided inputs within CLI commands. Successful exploitation leads to complete system compromise.
