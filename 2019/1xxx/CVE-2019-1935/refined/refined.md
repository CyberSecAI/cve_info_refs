{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the presence of a documented default account (scpuser) with an undocumented default password and incorrect permission settings for that account. Changing the default password for this account is not enforced during the installation of the product.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can log in to the CLI of an affected system by using the scpuser account, which has default user credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the scpuser account. This includes full read and write access to the system's database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access via SSH"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have network access to the affected system. No authentication is initially required but knowledge of the default credentials of the 'scpuser' is needed."
