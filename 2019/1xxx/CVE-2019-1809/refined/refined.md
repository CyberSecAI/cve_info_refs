Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper verification of digital signatures for patch images in Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Signature Verification:** The system fails to adequately validate the digital signatures of software patches, allowing unsigned or maliciously crafted patches to bypass checks.
- **Bypass of Security Checks:**  The flawed verification process allows an attacker to circumvent security mechanisms designed to ensure software integrity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Software Installation:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to install a malicious software patch on the affected device.
- **Booting Malicious Image:** The attacker can then boot the device using the malicious patch image, potentially gaining control or causing harm.
- **Compromise of Device:** This could lead to full compromise of the device, allowing for further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the affected device.
- **Software Patch Loading:** The attacker needs to load the crafted malicious software patch onto the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have authenticated access to the device with administrator-level privileges.
- **Local Presence:**  The attacker must be in a position to directly interact with the device or have a method to load the malicious patch.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects specific Cisco products running vulnerable versions of NX-OS Software, including MDS 9700 Series Multilayer Directors, Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches, and UCS 6200 and 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the issue and there are no workarounds.
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.4 (MEDIUM) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
