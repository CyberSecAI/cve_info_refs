Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1808

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper verification of digital signatures for patch images within Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Digital Signature Verification:** The system fails to adequately validate the digital signatures of software patches before installation. This weakness allows the loading of unsigned or maliciously signed patches.
- **CWE-347:** This corresponds to "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature."

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Software Installation:** A successful exploit enables an attacker to install a malicious software patch on the affected device.
- **Compromised Boot Image:** By loading a malicious patch, the attacker can force the device to boot from a compromised software image.
- **Full System Compromise:**  The attacker could achieve complete control over the device.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** High impact on all three areas, as reflected in the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level credentials on the device.
