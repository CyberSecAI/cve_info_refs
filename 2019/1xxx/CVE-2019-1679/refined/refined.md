Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access controls within the REST API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability is an SSRF, where an attacker can make the affected server send HTTP requests to arbitrary hosts. This is enabled by the lack of proper access controls in the REST API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit allows an attacker to trigger HTTP requests from the affected server to any host they choose. This could potentially enable network scanning, access to internal resources, or further exploitation depending on the target.
*   The CVSS score indicates that the confidentiality impact is "None", the integrity impact is "Low", and the availability impact is "None". The primary threat is the ability to make the server act as a proxy, potentially accessing internal resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely, as the vulnerability is in the web interface.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected server's REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the affected server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco TelePresence Conductor, Cisco Expressway Series, and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) software.
*   There are no known workarounds; the solution is to apply the provided software updates.
*   The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
* The provided CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
* The provided CWE is: CWE-918
