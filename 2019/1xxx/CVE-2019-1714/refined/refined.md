Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper credential management in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO) for Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) and AnyConnect Remote Access VPN. Specifically, it occurs when using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) or basic authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SAML 2.0 Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is that an attacker can bypass SAML 2.0 authentication under specific conditions due to the improper handling of credentials.
*   **Improper Credential Management:** The vulnerability is directly tied to the way the system handles credentials when NTLM or basic authentication is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **VPN Session Hijacking:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can successfully establish a VPN session to an affected device. This happens after another VPN user has already successfully authenticated through SAML SSO.
*   **Access to Secured Networks:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain access to secured networks that are behind the affected device, potentially compromising sensitive data and resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through a remote network connection.
*   **VPN Session Initiation:** The attack involves initiating a VPN session to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the targeted device remotely.
*   **Timing/Session Awareness:** The attacker must exploit the vulnerability after a legitimate user has already authenticated to the VPN via SAML SSO.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker is not required to have valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software Release 9.7.1 and later, and Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.1 and later when configured for SAML 2.0-based SSO for Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) or AnyConnect Remote Access VPN.
* The vulnerability is present only if the device is configured as both a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) and a SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP).
* There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*  Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
