| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.8 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO) for Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) and AnyConnect Remote Access VPN in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to successfully establish a VPN session to an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper credential management when using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) or basic authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a VPN session to an affected device after another VPN user has successfully authenticated to the affected device via SAML SSO. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect to secured networks behind the affected device.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asaftd-saml-vpn [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asaftd-saml-vpn\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.7.1 or later or Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.1 or later configured for SAML 2.0-based SSO for Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) or AnyConnect Remote Access VPN:\r\n\r\n3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)\r\nAdaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Firewalls\r\nASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers\r\nAdaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)\r\nFirepower 2100 Series\r\nFirepower 4100 Series\r\nFirepower 9300 Security Appliances\r\nFirepower Threat Defense Virtual\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n ASA and FTD Features\r\nCisco ASA Software and FTD Software are vulnerable only if all of the following features are configured:\r\n\r\nSAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP)\r\nSAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP)\r\nAnyConnect Remote Access VPN or Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN)\r\n\r\nNote: SAML 2.0 for AnyConnect features are first supported as of ASA Release 9.7.1, FTD Release 6.2.1, and AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Release 4.4.00243.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether ASA or FTD is configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP, administrators can use the show webvpn saml idp CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show webvpn saml idp\r\n saml idp my\_domain\_idp url sign-in https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect url sign-out https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect trustpoint idp my\_domain\_trustpoint trustpoint sp asa\_trustpoint\r\n\r\nTo determine whether ASA or FTD is configured with SAML 2.0 SP, administrators can use the show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|saml CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured with SAML 2.0 SP:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|saml\r\ntunnel-group cloud\_idp\_onelogin type remote-access\r\ntunnel-group cloud\_idp\_onelogin webvpn-attributes\r\nauthentication saml\r\nsaml identity-provider my\_domain\_idp\r\n\r\nTo determine whether ASA or FTD is configured for AnyConnect Remote Access VPN or Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN), administrators can use the show running-config CLI command and consult the following table for vulnerable configurations:\r\n\r\n Feature Vulnerable Configuration AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services) crypto ikev2 enable \r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable AnyConnect SSL VPN webvpn\r\n enable  Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN)\r\n webvpn\r\n enable  Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18 Device Manager Version 7.4(1) . . .\r\n\r\nIf a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.\r\n Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n ---------------------[ ftd ]--------------------- Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362) UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt VDB version : 279 ----------------------------------------------------"

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software VPN SAML Authentication Bypass Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190501-asaftd-saml-vpn  First Published: 2019 May 1 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2019 May 2 17:39 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvn72570](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvn72570)     CVE-2019-1714     CWE-255       CVSS Score: [Base 5.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-1714     CWE-255       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asaftd-saml-vpn/csaf/cisco-sa-20190501-asaftd-saml-vpn.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup   Language (SAML) 2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO) for Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) and   AnyConnect Remote Access VPN in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA)   Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow   an unauthenticated, remote attacker to successfully establish a VPN   session to an affected device.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.7.1 or later or Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.1 or later configured for **SAML 2.0-based SSO** for **Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN)** or **AnyConnect Remote Access VPN**:    + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + Firepower Threat Defense Virtual For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. ASA and FTD Features Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software are vulnerable only if all of the following features are configured:    1. SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP)   2. SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP)   3. AnyConnect Remote Access VPN *or* Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) **Note:** SAML 2.0 for AnyConnect features are first supported as of ASA Release 9.7.1, FTD Release 6.2.1, and AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Release 4.4.00243.  To determine whether ASA or FTD is configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP, administrators can use the **show webvpn saml idp** CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP:  ```   ciscoasa# show webvpn saml idp    saml idp my_domain_idp     url sign-in https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect     url sign-out https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect     trustpoint idp my_domain_trustpoint     trustpoint sp asa_trustpoint   ```  To determine whether ASA or FTD is configured with SAML 2.0 SP, administrators can use the **show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|saml** CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured with SAML 2.0 SP:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|samltunnel-group cloud_idp_onelogin type remote-accesstunnel-group cloud_idp_onelogin webvpn-attributes authentication saml saml identity-provider my_domain_idp   ```  To determine whether ASA or FTD is configured for AnyConnect Remote Access VPN or Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN), administrators can use the **show running-config** CLI command and consult the following table for vulnerable configurations:       | Feature | Vulnerable Configuration |   | --- | --- |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  client-services port  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services) | crypto ikev2 enable  webvpn anyconnect enable |   | AnyConnect SSL VPN | webvpn enable |   | Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) | webvpn enable |      Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release To determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version | include Version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:  ```   ciscoasa# show version | include Version   Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18   Device Manager Version 7.4(1)   .   .   .   ```  If a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the **Device Dashboard** tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane. Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:  ```   > show version      ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------   Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)   UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c   Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt   VDB version : 279   ----------------------------------------------------   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has   confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco ASA Software or   FTD Software running on the following platforms:    + ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + ASA 5505 Adaptive Security Appliance1 1 ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances other than   the ASA 5505 have reached the end-of-support milestone and are no   longer evaluated for security vulnerabilities.
