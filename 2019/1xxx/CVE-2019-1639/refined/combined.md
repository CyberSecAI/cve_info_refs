The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and the Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows, which are available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites, Cisco Webex Meetings Online sites, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server:    + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS32.15.33   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS33 sites - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version WBS33.6.7 or WBS33.7.0   + Cisco Webex Meetings Online - All Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player versions prior to Version 1.3.40   + Cisco Webex Meetings Server - All Webex Network Recording Player versions prior to Version 2.8MR3 SecurityPatch1 or 3.0MR2 SecurityPatch2 To determine which version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player or the Cisco Webex Player is installed on a system, users can open the player and choose **Help** > **About**. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Mac OS is not affected.  Details  * Cisco Webex Business Suite services and Cisco Webex Meetings Online are hosted, multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco Webex. Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers host, manage, and maintain in their private clouds. Cisco Webex Business Suite services can be configured to allow users to store meeting recordings online and download those recordings as ARF files. These services can also be configured to allow users to record meetings directly on their local computers as WRF files.  The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player is the application that is used to play back ARF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can be installed manually from the [Cisco Webex website](https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html) or automatically when a user accesses an ARF file for streaming playback from a Cisco Webex Business Suite site.  The Cisco Webex Player is the application that is used to play back WRF files. It is available from Cisco Webex Business Suite sites (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. It is not available from Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The player can also be installed manually from the [Cisco Webex website](https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, customers may remove the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player from a system by using the software-removal procedure for the operating system. For example, to remove a player from a Microsoft Windows 10 system, customers can use the **Apps & Features** app in **Windows Settings**.  To remove all Cisco Webex software from a Microsoft Windows system, customers can use the Meeting Services Removal Tool, which is available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article, [Cisco Webex and 3rd Party Support Utilities](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396). By removing the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player, a user will be unable to play media. However, the next time media is accessed, the system will download a new version of the software, providing the user with an updated version.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  **Fixed Version Information**  Cisco has fixed these vulnerabilities in the following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player:    + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS32 sites - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS32.15.33 and later   + Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS33 sites - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions WBS33.6.7 and later   + Cisco Webex Meetings Online - Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player Versions 1.3.40 and later   + Cisco Webex Meetings Server - Webex Network Recording Player Versions 2.8MR3 SecurityPatch1 or 3.0MR2 SecurityPatch2 and later Cisco has not and will not fix all these vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Business Suite WBS31 sites because those sites have reached the end-of-version-support milestone. For information about this milestone and the upgrade plans for WBS31 sites, see [Cisco Webex Meetings Suite End-of-Version Support Policy](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/ns12j0bb).      Customers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player in either of two ways:    + **Automatically**: The player will be automatically upgraded to the latest version of the software when a user accesses an ARF file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Business Suite site (WBS32 or WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online site, or Cisco Webex Meetings Server.   + **Manually**: The player can be downloaded and installed from <https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>.**Note**: Customers who use locked-down Cisco Webex sites will not receive updated versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player automatically. These customers should contact Cisco Webex Customer Support to obtain updates or the latest version of the player from <https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>.    Customers can upgrade to a fixed version of the Cisco Webex Player by uninstalling their current version of the player and then downloading and installing the latest version of the player from <https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html>.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.8 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:U/CR:L/IR:L/AR:L/MAV:L/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:U/MC:N/MI:N/MA:N |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: |
