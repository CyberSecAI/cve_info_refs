Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1602

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of filesystem permissions in Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate filesystem permissions allow access to sensitive data.
- The vulnerability is present in devices running Cisco NX-OS Software with NX-API feature enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to access sensitive data.
- The attacker can use the acquired sensitive data to authenticate to the NX-API server.
- Successfully exploiting the vulnerability allows an attacker to gain administrator privileges and make configuration changes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the affected device.
- It requires the attacker to log in to the CLI of an affected device.
- The attacker needs to access a specific file to obtain the sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated, local user on the device.
- The attacker must be able to access the device's CLI.
- The attacker should have knowledge of the specific file containing sensitive data and how to utilize the data.

**Additional Notes:**
- NX-API is disabled by default.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, and software updates are necessary.
- The vulnerability affects specific Cisco Nexus series switches running vulnerable versions of NX-OS Software.
- The provided CVSS score is 7.8 (High) with the vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
