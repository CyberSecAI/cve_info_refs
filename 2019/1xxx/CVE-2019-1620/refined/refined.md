Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to incorrect permission settings in the Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) software. Specifically, the `FileUploadServlet` allows writing arbitrary files to the filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The `FileUploadServlet` does not properly validate the file type being uploaded. Although it checks for image formats, it proceeds to write the file via the `processUploadedFile` function regardless of its type if it fails the image format check. This allows an attacker to upload any file with any extension.
- **Incorrect Permissions:** The file upload vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files on the filesystem. The Apache Tomcat server runs as root, so files uploaded via this servlet will be written as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to write arbitrary files on the filesystem, including malicious WAR files into the Tomcat webapps folder. This results in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected device, leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through the web-based management interface of Cisco DCNM.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/fm/fileUpload` endpoint with specific parameters (`uploadDir`, `fname`, and `filePath`) and a file payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the DCNM server.
- **No Authentication (for DCNM 11.1(1)):** In DCNM version 11.1(1) the attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability and achieve remote code execution. Prior versions require authentication using a valid unprivileged user account.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable servlet's URL (`/fm/fileUpload`).
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to construct a specific multipart/form-data request with the correct parameters to upload a file to the system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) software releases prior to Release 11.2(1).
- In DCNM version 11.0(1) and earlier, authentication is required to exploit the file upload vulnerability.
- In DCNM version 11.1(1), the affected web servlet can be accessed without authentication making this a critical vulnerability.
- Cisco addressed the vulnerability in DCNM software release 11.2(1) by removing the affected servlet completely.
- Proof-of-concept exploit code is publicly available.
- A Metasploit module has been released for this vulnerability.
