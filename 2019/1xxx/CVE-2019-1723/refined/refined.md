Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1723:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of a user account with a default, static password within the Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials: The CSPC software contains a user account with a static password, making it easily guessable or exploitable.
- Lack of proper access control: The existence of a default account with a static password allows unauthorized access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain access to the affected device.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to log in to the CSPC using the default account.
- Once logged in, attackers can gain a shell on the system, potentially leading to further attacks. Although the account doesn't have administrator privileges, a compromised system can be leveraged for other malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote access: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- SSH or Console Access: Attackers could access the collector using SSH or the console.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to reach the affected CSPC device over the network.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need any existing credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- No special privileges are required.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco CSPC releases 2.7.2 through 2.7.4.5
- All releases of 2.8.x prior to 2.8.1.2

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to the following fixed versions:
- Cisco CSPC 2.7.4.6 or later.
- Cisco CSPC 2.8.1.2 or later.

This vulnerability is considered critical with a CVSS base score of 9.8.
