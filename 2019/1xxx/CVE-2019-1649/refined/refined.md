Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the logic of Cisco's proprietary Secure Boot implementation, specifically the access control to a hardware component related to the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).
*   The root cause is an improper check during on-premise updates to the FPGA, a key component for secure boot functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is that access control to the FPGA component is not properly enforced, allowing unauthorized modifications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Firmware Tampering:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to write a modified firmware image to the affected FPGA component.
*   **Device Unusability:** The reprogramming process may fail, rendering the device unusable and requiring hardware replacement.
*   **Bypass of Secure Boot:** By tampering with the FPGA, an attacker could potentially bypass the secure boot verification process, allowing them to install and boot a malicious software image. This can lead to persistent changes to the root trust for software integrity.
*   **Potential for Root Access (when combined with CVE-2019-1862):** When exploited alongside the IOS XE web UI command injection vulnerability (CVE-2019-1862), an attacker could achieve remote and persistent bypass of Secure Boot as well as prevent future software updates.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the vulnerable device. However, exploitation can be achieved remotely if combined with other vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-1862 that can provide access to the underlying OS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Access:** An attacker needs privileged administrative access to the device.
*   **OS Access:**  The attacker must also be able to access the underlying operating system running on the device. This can be achieved via a supported mechanism or by exploiting another vulnerability.
*   **Platform-Specific Exploit:**  A platform-specific exploit is necessary, as exploits developed for one hardware platform are unlikely to work on others.
*   **Authenticated Access**: The attacker must have authenticated access to the device

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit is known to exist and has been demonstrated on the Cisco ASR 1001-X, although it is not publicly available.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. The update requires an on-premise reprogramming of a low-level hardware component. Customers are advised to consult the Release Note Enclosure for the Cisco bug relevant to their platform for the specific update procedure.

In summary, CVE-2019-1649 describes a vulnerability in Cisco's Secure Boot implementation that allows a local attacker with privileged access to overwrite firmware on a key component, potentially leading to a compromise of the device's security. The advisory also highlights the importance of patching devices and following the vendor's recommendations for secure management access. When combined with CVE-2019-1862 this leads to a remote root compromise.
