Rockwell Automation recommends users update to firmware version [FRN v6.4.0](https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductFindDownloads.aspx?crumb=112&mode=3&refSoft=1&versions=55706), which addresses the reported vulnerability.

Rockwell also provides the following general security guidelines:

* Utilize proper network infrastructure controls, such as firewalls, to help ensure that requests from unauthorized sources are blocked and the controls are isolated from the business network.
* Consult the product documentation for specific features, such as access control lists and deep packet inspection, that may be used to block unauthorized changes, etc.
* Block all traffic to EtherNet/IP or other CIP protocol-based devices from outside the manufacturing zone by blocking or restricting access to TCP and UDP Port 2222 and Port 44818, using proper network infrastructure controls such as firewalls, UTM devices, or other security appliances. For more information on TCP/UDP ports used by Rockwell Automation products, see [Knowledgebase Article ID 898270](https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/898270).
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Ensure the least-privilege user principle is followed.
* Ensure the product is in a physically secure area.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

"text": "A vulnerability in the logic that handles access control to one of the hardware components in Cisco's proprietary Secure Boot implementation could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write a modified firmware image to the component. This vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages on-premise updates to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the Secure Boot hardware implementation. An attacker with elevated privileges and access to the underlying operating system that is running on the affected device could exploit this vulnerability by writing a modified firmware image to the FPGA. A successful exploit could either cause the device to become unusable (and require a hardware replacement) or allow tampering with the Secure Boot verification process, which under some circumstances may allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image.\r\n\r\nCisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190513-secureboot [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190513-secureboot\"]"

"text": "An attacker will need to fulfill all the following conditions to attempt to exploit this vulnerability:\r\n\r\nHave privileged administrative access to the device.\r\nBe able to access the underlying operating system running on the device; this can be achieved either by using a supported, documented mechanism or by exploiting another vulnerability that would provide an attacker with such access.\r\nDevelop or have access to a platform-specific exploit. An attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability across multiple affected platforms would need to research each one of those platforms and then develop a platform-specific exploit. Although the research process could be reused across different platforms, an exploit developed for a given hardware platform is unlikely to work on a different hardware platform.\r\n\r\nCisco is in the process of developing and releasing software fixes for all affected platforms. In most cases, the fix will require an on-premise reprogramming of a low-level hardware component that is required for normal device operation. A failure during this reprogramming process may cause the device to become unusable and require a hardware replacement. Customers are advised to consult the Release Note Enclosure for the Cisco bug relevant to their platform for the following information:\r\n\r\nCauses that could lead to a failure of the reprogramming process and cause the device to become unusable\r\nA platform-specific set of steps that are required to reprogram a device\r\nThe procedure required to determine whether a given device is running an affected firmware version (that therefore must be fixed) or whether the device is already running a fixed firmware version\r\n\r\nThe product release notes that are published with each platform-specific fixed software release will include more detailed information about items 2 and 3 in the preceding list. The product release notes should be considered the most up-to-date source of information about these items.\r\n\r\n For details about Secure Boot and related Trustworthy Technologies, please refer to the Trustworthy Technologies Datasheet [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en\_us/about/doing\_business/trust-center/docs/trustworthy-technologies-datasheet.pdf\"]. A list of all Cisco products supporting secure boot technology can be found at the following link: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en\_us/about/doing\_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-secure-boot-product-list.pdf [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en\_us/about/doing\_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-secure-boot-product-list.pdf\"]"

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade."

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.7 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.7 |

This vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality.  The vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages on-premise updates to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the Secure Boot hardware implementation. An attacker with elevated privileges and access to the underlying operating system that is running on the affected device could exploit this vulnerability by writing a modified firmware image to the FPGA. A successful exploit could either cause the device to become unusable (and require a hardware replacement) or allow tampering with the Secure Boot verification process, which under some circumstances may allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image.  Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  The table includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID) and contain additional platform-specific information and fixed releases.  If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the Last Updated date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.       | Product | Cisco Bug ID | Fixed Release Availability |   | --- | --- | --- |   |

TBD (Sep 2019) |      Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Cisco has investigated all Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality to verify that they are enforcing the appropriate access control checks.  Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  No other Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality are vulnerable.  Details  * An attacker will need to fulfill all the following conditions to attempt to exploit this vulnerability:    + Have privileged administrative access to the device.   + Be able to access the underlying operating system running on the device; this can be achieved either by using a supported, documented mechanism or by exploiting another vulnerability that would provide an attacker with such access.   + Develop or have access to a platform-specific exploit. An attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability across multiple affected platforms would need to research each one of those platforms and then develop a platform-specific exploit. Although the research process could be reused across different platforms, an exploit developed for a given hardware platform is unlikely to work on a different hardware platform. Cisco is in the process of developing and releasing software fixes for all affected platforms. In most cases, the fix will require an on-premise reprogramming of a low-level hardware component that is required for normal device operation. A failure during this reprogramming process may cause the device to become unusable and require a hardware replacement. Customers are advised to consult the Release Note Enclosure for the Cisco bug relevant to their platform for the following information:    1. Causes that could lead to a failure of the reprogramming process and cause the device to become unusable   2. A platform-specific set of steps that are required to reprogram a device   3. The procedure required to determine whether a given device is running an affected firmware version (that therefore must be fixed) or whether the device is already running a fixed firmware version The product release notes that are published with each platform-specific fixed software release will include more detailed information about items 2 and 3 in the preceding list. The product release notes should be considered the most up-to-date source of information about these items.  For details about Secure Boot and related Trustworthy Technologies, please refer to the [Trustworthy Technologies Datasheet](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/trustworthy-technologies-datasheet.pdf). A list of all Cisco products supporting secure boot technology can be found at the following link: <https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-secure-boot-product-list.pdf>  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html) provides information about how to harden the device and secure management access. Implementing the recommendations in this document would reduce the attack surface for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * For information about fixed software releases, consult the Cisco bugs identified in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory.  Cisco will release free [software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * This vulnerability was publicly disclosed by Red Balloon Security on May 13, 2019.  The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware of the existence of proof-of-concept code that demonstrates this   vulnerability on the Cisco ASR 1001-X. There are no indications at this time that this proof-of-concept code is publicly available.  Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

## Cisco Trust Anchor module (TAm) improperly checks code and Cisco IOS XE web UI does not sanitize user input

#### Vulnerability Note VU#400865

Original Release Date: 2019-05-14 | Last Revised: 2019-05-16

---

### Overview

Cisco's Trust Anchor module (TAm) can be bypassed through manipulating the bitstream of the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This component handles access control to a hardware component within Cisco's Secure Boot implementations, which affects multiple products that support this functionality. An authenticated, local attacker could bypass the Secure Boot and make persistent changes to the root trust for software integrity. Additionally, Cisco's IOS XE web UI improperly sanitizes user-input, and could allow an authenticated, remote attack to execute commands. An authenticated, remote attacker could execute commands as root on the vulnerable device.

### Description

| **CVE-2019-1649**: Secure Boot Tampering, also known as Thrangrycat  The logic that handles Cisco's Secure Boot improperly checks an area of code that manages the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The secure boot feature is a proprietary FPGA based implementation used for ensuring chain of trust for software. The secure boot can be bypassed by modifying the bitstream of the FPGA, allowing an authenticated, local attacker to make persistent modification to the root of trust for software integrity.**CVE-2019-1862**: IOS XE Web UI Command InjectionThe web user interface of Cisco IOS XE improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. This could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands as root on the underlying Linux shell. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local or remote attacker could write a new firmware image to the TAm. When exploited together, these vulnerabilities could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to remotely and persistently bypass Secure Boot and prevent future software updates to the TAm.To exploit CVE-2019-1649, an attacker would need to have privileged administrative access to the device. This type of access could be achieved by exploiting the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1862 or other potential remote command injection vulnerabilities. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **CVE-2019-1649**Cisco is in the process of developing and releasing software fixes for all affected platforms. We recommend installing this update when it is available.**CVE-2019-1862**Apply the update from Cisco. |
| --- |

| **Workaround****CVE-2019-1649**Guidance from Cisco recommends that users refer to the Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices, as it provides information about how to harden the device and secure management access. Implementing the recommendations in this document would likely reduce the attack surface for this vulnerability. |
