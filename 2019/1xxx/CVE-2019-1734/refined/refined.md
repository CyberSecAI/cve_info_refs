Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incomplete role-based access control (RBAC) verification within the implementation of a CLI diagnostic command in Cisco FXOS and NX-OS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate RBAC verification allows unauthorized access to sensitive system files.
- The vulnerability enables arbitrary file reading due to a lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read sensitive files from the device. This can lead to information disclosure.
- The disclosed information can be leveraged for further reconnaissance attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the CLI interface of the affected Cisco devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the device. Therefore, they require valid device credentials.
- The attacker needs to have local access to the device

**Summary of Vulnerability Details:**
An authenticated local attacker can exploit a CLI diagnostic command in Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software by providing crafted user-input parameters. The incomplete RBAC verification allows the attacker to bypass access control checks and perform arbitrary reads of sensitive files, leading to information disclosure.

**Additional Information:**
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability; software updates are required to remediate it.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Cisco products that use FXOS and NX-OS.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
