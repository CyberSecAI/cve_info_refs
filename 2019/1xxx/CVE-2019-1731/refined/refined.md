- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incomplete error handling during SSH key export or import operations. Specifically, during SSH key export a specific error can lead to exposure of user's private SSH key. A similar error type during SSH key import can lead to unintended import of passphrase protected private SSH key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incomplete error handling during SSH key export/import.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of a user's private SSH key to all authenticated users on the targeted device, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems where the exposed key is used for authentication. In addition, passphrase-protected SSH keys may be imported unintentionally.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated, local attacker with valid administrator device credentials using a crafted command at the CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated with valid administrator device credentials. They also need to be able to access the device's CLI.
