*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# Android - binder Use-After-Free of VMA via race Between reclaim and munmap

#### EDB-ID:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
The following bug report solely looks at the situation on the upstream master
branch; while from a cursory look, at least the wahoo kernel also looks
affected, I have only properly tested this on upstream master.

There is a race condition between the direct reclaim path (enters binder through
the binder_shrinker) and the munmap() syscall (enters binder through the ->close
handler of binder_vm_ops).

Coming from the munmap() syscall:

binder_vma_close()->binder_alloc_vma_close()->binder_alloc_set_vma() sets
alloc->vma to NULL without taking any extra locks; binder_vma_close() is called
from remove_vma()<-remove_vma_list()<-__do_munmap()<-__vm_munmap()<-sys_munmap()
with only the mmap_sem held for writing.

Coming through the direct reclaim path:

binder_alloc_free_page() doesn't hold the mmap_sem on entry. It contains the
following code (comments added by me):

enum lru_status binder_alloc_free_page(struct list_head *item,
                                       struct list_lru_one *lru,
                                       spinlock_t *lock,
                                       void *cb_arg)
{
[...]
        alloc = page->alloc;
        if (!mutex_trylock(&alloc->mutex))
                goto err_get_alloc_mutex_failed;

        if (!page->page_ptr)
                goto err_page_already_freed;

        index = page - alloc->pages;
        page_addr = (uintptr_t)alloc->buffer + index * PAGE_SIZE;
        // unprotected pointer read! `vma` can immediately be freed
        vma = binder_alloc_get_vma(alloc);
        if (vma) {
                if (!mmget_not_zero(alloc->vma_vm_mm))
                        goto err_mmget;
                mm = alloc->vma_vm_mm;
                if (!down_write_trylock(&mm->mmap_sem))
                        goto err_down_write_mmap_sem_failed;
                // mmap_sem is held at this point, but the vma pointer was read
                // before and can be dangling
        }

        list_lru_isolate(lru, item);
        spin_unlock(lock);

        if (vma) {
                trace_binder_unmap_user_start(alloc, index);

                // dangling vma pointer passed to zap_page_range
                zap_page_range(vma,
                               page_addr + alloc->user_buffer_offset,
                               PAGE_SIZE);

                trace_binder_unmap_user_end(alloc, index);

                up_write(&mm->mmap_sem);
                mmput(mm);
        }

Repro instructions:

Unpack the attached binder_race_freevma.tar.
Apply the patch 0001-binder-VMA-unprotected-read-helper.patch to an upstream
git master tree to widen the race window.
Make sure that KASAN is enabled in your kernel config.
Build and boot into the built kernel.
Run "echo 16383 > /sys/module/binder/parameters/debug_mask" for more dmesg debug
output.
Compile the PoC with ./compile.sh and, as root, run ./poc to trigger the bug.

The output of the PoC should look like this:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207
                 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233
                 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-20836

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel
    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be
    exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

    It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively
    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the
    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when
    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,
    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using
    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an
    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-1999

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  If this driver is loaded, a
    local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-10207

    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with
    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this
    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash".  This could enable
    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
    remote servers and from different networks.  The "siphash"
    function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-12817

    It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the
    hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a
    process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB.  This could
    lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of
    memory between user processes.  A local user could use this for
    privilege escalation.  Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom
    kernel with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected.

CVE-2019-12984

    It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not
    properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user on a system with an
    NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-13233

    Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture,
    in use of the LDT.  This could lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service.

CVE-2019-13631

    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially
    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-13648

    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without
    Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to
    restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call.  A local
    user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

CVE-2019-14283

    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a
    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the
    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the
    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk
    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20836 CVE-2019-1125 CVE-2019-1999 CVE-2019-10207
                 CVE-2019-10638 CVE-2019-12817 CVE-2019-12984 CVE-2019-13233
                 CVE-2019-13631 CVE-2019-13648 CVE-2019-14283 CVE-2019-14284

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-20836

    chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel
    subsystem supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which
    could lead to a use-after-free.  It is not clear how this might be
    exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

    It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively
    skip a conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the
    kernel from user mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when
    it should be skipped.  This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1,
    which could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel or other processes.  It has been mitigated by using
    memory barriers to limit speculative execution.  Systems using an
    i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-1999

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  If this driver is loaded, a
    local user might be able to use this for denial-of-service
    (memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-10207

    The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
    drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters.  A local user with
    access to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this
    for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

    Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
    packet IDs used a weak hash function, "jhash".  This could enable
    tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
    remote servers and from different networks.  The "siphash"
    function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-12817

    It was discovered that on the PowerPC (ppc64el) architecture, the
    hash page table (HPT) code did not correctly handle fork() in a
    process with memory mapped at addresses above 512 TiB.  This could
    lead to a use-after-free in the kernel, or unintended sharing of
    memory between user processes.  A local user could use this for
    privilege escalation.  Systems using the radix MMU, or a custom
    kernel with a 4 KiB page size, are not affected.

CVE-2019-12984

    It was discovered that the NFC protocol implementation did not
    properly validate a netlink control message, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  A local user on a system with an
    NFC interface could use this for denial-of-service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-13233

    Jann Horn discovered a race condition on the x86 architecture,
    in use of the LDT.  This could lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local user could possibly use this for denial-of-service.

CVE-2019-13631

    It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
    overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
    descriptor.  A physically present user with a specially
    constructed USB device could use this to cause a denial-of-service
    (BUG/oops), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-13648

    Praveen Pandey reported that on PowerPC (ppc64el) systems without
    Transactional Memory (TM), the kernel would still attempt to
    restore TM state passed to the sigreturn() system call.  A local
    user could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

CVE-2019-14283

    The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
    driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a
    disk present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the
    I/O buffer, possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

    The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the
    floppy disk driver.  A local user with access to a floppy disk
    device could use this for denial-of-service (oops).

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.19.37-5+deb10u2.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

ext4: always verify the magic number in xattr blocksIf there an inode points to a block which is also some other type of
metadata block (such as a block allocation bitmap), the
buffer\_verified flag can be set when it was validated as that other
metadata block type; however, it would make a really terrible external
attribute block. The reason why we use the verified flag is to avoid
constantly reverifying the block. However, it doesn't take much
overhead to make sure the magic number of the xattr block is correct,
and this will avoid potential crashes.
This addresses CVE-2018-10879.

# Android Security Bulletin — February 2019

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published February 4, 2019*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2019-02-05 or later address
all of these issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705).

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before
publication. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in
Framework that could allow a remote attacker using a specially crafted
PNG file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
The [severity assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the
vulnerability would possibly have on an affected device, assuming
the platform and service mitigations are turned off for development
purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google Play Protect mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and Google Play Protect, which improve the security of the Android platform.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air update (OTA) and
firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[February 2019
Pixel Update Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2019-02-01).

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as
[Google Play
Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect). These capabilities reduce the likelihood that security
vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through
  [Google Play
  Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect) and warns users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile
  Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially important for users who install apps from
  outside of Google Play.

## 2019-02-01 security patch level vulnerability details

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these
issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[Check and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2019-02-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2019-02-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2019-02-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2019-02-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2019-02-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2019-02-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2019-02-01 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2019-02-05 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table
reference the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally
contained in the latest binary drivers for Pixel devices
available from the
[Google
Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device / partner security bulletins, such as the
Pixel bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in the
device / partner security bulletins are not required for
declaring a security patch level. Android device and chipset manufacturers are
encouraged to document the presence of other fixes on their devices through
their own security websites, such as the
[Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb),
[LGE](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates.html), or
[Pixel](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel) security bulletins.
