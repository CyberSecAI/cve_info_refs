Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient normalization of a text-based payload within the affected Cisco software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input sanitization/normalization.
- Failure to properly handle obfuscated payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass filtering protections.
- This bypass could enable the delivery of malicious payloads to protected systems that would normally be blocked.
- The vulnerability has an impact on integrity, as it allows malicious payloads to pass through the filtering system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack vector, the attacker can send traffic to the vulnerable device over a network.
- The attacker needs to send specially crafted, obfuscated payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication or special privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft obfuscated payloads

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software
- Cisco FirePOWER Services Software for ASA
- Cisco Firepower Management Center Software.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 5.8 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
