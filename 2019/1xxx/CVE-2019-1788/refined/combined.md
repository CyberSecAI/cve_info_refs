## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-1787.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-1789.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-1788 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1788)

#### Description

A vulnerability in the Object Linking & Embedding (OLE2) file scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input and validation checking mechanisms for OLE2 files sent an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed OLE2 files to the device running an affected version ClamAV Software. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds write condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.

Package        : clamav
Version        : 0.100.3+dfsg-0+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-1787 CVE-2019-1788 CVE-2019-1789
Debian Bug     :

Out-of-bounds read and write conditions have been fixed in clamav.

CVE-2019-1787

    An out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning PDF
    documents. The defect is a failure to correctly keep track of the number
    of bytes remaining in a buffer when indexing file data.

CVE-2019-1788

    An out-of-bounds heap write condition may occur when scanning OLE2 files
    such as Microsoft Office 97-2003 documents. The invalid write happens when
    an invalid pointer is mistakenly used to initialize a 32bit integer to
    zero. This is likely to crash the application.

CVE-2019-1789

    An out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning PE files
    (i.e. Windows EXE and DLL files) that have been packed using Aspack as a
    result of inadequate bound-checking.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.100.3+dfsg-0+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# CVE-2019-1787

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-1786.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-1788.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-1787 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1787)

#### Description

A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while indexing remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap buffer out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1130721#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-03-27 16:51:06 UTC  ``` <https://blog.clamav.net/2019/03/clamav-01012-and-01003-patches-have.html>                                                                                                                        ClamAV 0.100.3 ClamAV 0.100.3 is a patch release to address a few security related bugs.  This patch release is being released alongside the 0.101.2 patch so that users who are unable to upgrade to 0.101 due to libclamav API changes are protected.  The bug fixes in this release are limited to security-related bugs only. Users are encouraged to upgrade to 0.101.2 for additional improvements.  - Fixes for the following vulnerabilities:   - CVE-2019-1787:     An out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning PDF     documents. The defect is a failure to correctly keep track of the number     of bytes remaining in a buffer when indexing file data.   - CVE-2019-1789:     An out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning PE files     (i.e. Windows EXE and DLL files) that have been packed using Aspack as a     result of inadequate bound-checking.   - CVE-2019-1788:     An out-of-bounds heap write condition may occur when scanning OLE2 files     such as Microsoft Office 97-2003 documents. The invalid write happens when     an invalid pointer is mistakenly used to initialize a 32bit integer to     zero. This is likely to crash the application.  Thank you to the Google OSS-Fuzz project for identifying and reporting the bugs patched in this release. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1130721#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-29 11:00:08 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1130721) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/689788> Factory / clamav ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1130721#c2)  Reinhard Max   2019-03-29 11:15:25 UTC  ``` There are three more CVEs fixed in 0.101.2 that affected only the 0.101 series:  - CVE-2019-1786:   An out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning malformed PDF   documents as a result of improper bounds-checking. - CVE-2019-1785:   A path-traversal write condition may occur as a result of improper input   validation when scanning RAR archives. - CVE-2019-1798:   A use-after-free condition may occur as a result of improper error   handling when scanning nested RAR archives. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1130721#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-03-29 13:00:09 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1130721) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/689824> Factory / clamav ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1130721#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-04-01 12:35:14 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.
