Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-1394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `vMatchAPal` function in `win32k.sys`. This allows for a write operation outside the bounds of an allocated array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- Improper input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Attackers can elevate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- Arbitrary code execution: Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: Requires the attacker to have local access to the target system.
- The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- Local access to the vulnerable machine.

**Additional details:**
- Microsoft released a patch to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is located in the `vMatchAPal` function of `win32k.sys`.
