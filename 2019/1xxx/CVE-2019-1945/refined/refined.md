Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-1945:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Cisco ASA's smart tunnel functionality. Specifically, it occurs because the Cisco ASA can write files to specific locations on the file system, and the smart tunnel functionality does not validate the integrity of system files that load during execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of system files integrity when loading during execution.
- The ability for the ASA to write to specific file system locations, creating an attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
- Overwrite specific system files.
- Cause the smart tunnel to load a malicious executable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability on the client device that is attempting to establish a smart tunnel connection with the Cisco ASA.
- The attacker creates a malicious system file and writes it to a specific location on the file system during smart tunnel connection establishment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires valid device credentials on the local client device.
- The attacker needs to be a local, authenticated user on the client device.
- The attack must occur during the establishment of a smart tunnel connection with the Cisco ASA.
