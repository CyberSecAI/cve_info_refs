Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1769:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command within Cisco NX-OS Software. This lack of proper input sanitization allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-78:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'). This is the core weakness that allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system of an affected line card with the privilege level of *root*. This means the attacker can gain complete control over the line card's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **Local (AV:L)**. This means the attacker needs to have local access to the affected device's CLI.
*   The attack requires **High (PR:H)** privileges. An attacker must have valid administrator credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a local presence on the affected system and access to the CLI.
*   **Administrator Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid administrator-level credentials to authenticate to the device.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects several Cisco Nexus series switches running vulnerable versions of Cisco NX-OS software including: Nexus 3000, 3500, 3600, 9000 (standalone NX-OS mode), and 9500 R-Series platforms.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability except upgrading to a patched version.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, and details on the fixed releases for each affected product are listed in the advisory.
*  **Exploitation:** Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-1769 is a command injection vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS software that allows a local, authenticated attacker with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system of an attached line card. The vulnerability stems from insufficient argument validation in a specific CLI command. This can result in complete compromise of the affected line card.
