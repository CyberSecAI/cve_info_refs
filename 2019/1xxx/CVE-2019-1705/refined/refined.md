Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1705:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the remote access VPN session manager of Cisco ASA Software.
*   The core issue is that the ASA fails to delete temporary licenses allocated to VPN sessions when a user fails to provide a PIN or new password after the initial username/password authentication within a 5-minute timeout period.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The failure to release temporary licenses leads to a situation where the pool of available temporary licenses is exhausted.
*   **Improper Resource Management**: The ASA does not properly manage the release of licenses once the user session times out due to failed authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this by requesting an excessive number of remote access VPN sessions. When all temporary licenses are consumed, new legitimate connections are blocked, resulting in a DoS condition for remote access VPN services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Network Access**: The attacker only needs network access to the ASA device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the ASA device.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software when configured for remote-access VPN. It also affects multi-context configurations of 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA), ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls, ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Firepower 2100, 4100 and 9300 series.
*  A workaround is available that allows to temporarily clear the condition.
* Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
