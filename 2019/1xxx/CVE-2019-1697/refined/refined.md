Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1697:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper parsing of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) packets by Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. Specifically, the issue lies in how these systems handle LDAP packets that use Basic Encoding Rules (BER).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of incoming LDAP packets, particularly those encoded with BER. This allows a crafted LDAP packet to trigger a fault during parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to the affected device reloading, causing a denial of service condition. The device becomes unavailable, disrupting network operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the vulnerable device.
*   **Crafted LDAP Packet:** The attacker must be capable of creating and sending a specially crafted LDAP packet using BER encoding.
*   **No Credentials:** The attacker does not require any prior knowledge of the device's configuration or any form of authentication.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability impacts several Cisco products (both physical and virtual appliances) running ASA or FTD software with LDAP authentication configured.
