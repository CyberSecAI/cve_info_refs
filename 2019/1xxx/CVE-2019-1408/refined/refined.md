Based on the content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-1408:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write
*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation of user-supplied data in the `ulGetNearestIndexFromColorref` function within `win32k.sys`. This leads to a write outside the bounds of an allocated array.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation to SYSTEM, allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write
*   **Root Cause:** Improper validation of user-supplied data in the `GreSetMagicColors` function within `win32k.sys`. This leads to a write past the end of an allocated array.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local attacker with the ability to execute low-privileged code.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation to SYSTEM, allowing arbitrary code execution.
