Based on the provided documents, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2019-1886:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server certificates within the HTTPS decryption feature of Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insufficient validation of SSL server certificates. Specifically, the Cisco WSA is not properly validating malformed certificates from web servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Successful exploitation leads to an unexpected restart of the proxy process on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker.
- The attacker needs to install a malformed certificate on a web server.
- The attacker then sends a request to the web server through the Cisco WSA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious server with a malformed certificate.
- The attacker must be able to send requests to that server via a network that the vulnerable Cisco WSA is monitoring.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco WSA, both virtual and hardware appliances.
- It is only exploitable when the HTTPS Proxy feature is enabled and has at least one decryption policy configured. The HTTPS Proxy feature is disabled by default.
- Exploitation causes the proxy process to generate a core file with a particular backtrace.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds, although bypassing decryption for web servers hosting malicious certificates can mitigate the impact.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.6 (High) with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
- The affected versions are prior to 11.7, with fixed releases provided for older versions.
