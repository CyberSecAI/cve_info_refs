| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Smart Tunnel Vulnerabilities Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190807-asa-multi  First Published: 2019 August 7 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2019 August 29 13:00 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvo78789](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo78789)     CVE-2019-1944 CVE-2019-1945     CWE-20 CWE-732       CVSS Score: [Base 6.7](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-1944 CVE-2019-1945     CWE-20 CWE-732       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-asa-multi/csaf/cisco-sa-20190807-asa-multi.json)   Email      Summary  * Multiple vulnerabilities in the smart tunnel functionality of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to the *root* user or load a malicious library file while the tunnel is being established.  For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this security advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-asa-multi>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect Cisco ASA Software.  For information about which Cisco ASA Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableOnly products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Two vulnerabilities in the smart tunnel functionality of Cisco ASA could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to the *root* user or load a malicious library file during execution.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  **Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Smart Tunnel Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the smart tunnel functionality of Cisco ASA could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to the *root* user. This privilege escalation happens on a client device that attempts to establish a smart tunnel connection with the Cisco ASA. The escalation does not occur on the ASA itself.  The vulnerability occurs because the Cisco ASA smart tunnel creates local system files on the client device with file permissions that are not restrictive enough. In addition, the ASA smart tunnel does not validate the system commands in these local system files before executing them. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a malicious script on the client device when a valid user is establishing the Cisco ASA smart tunnel connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to *root* on the client machine without the user's knowledge. The attacker needs valid device credentials on the local client device to exploit this vulnerability.  The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-1944  **Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Smart Tunnel Library File Load Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the smart tunnel functionality of Cisco ASA could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite specific system files, which could then be loaded and executed during smart tunnel connection establishment. The attacker could take these actions on the client device that is attempting to establish the smart tunnel connection with the Cisco ASA and not on the ASA itself.  The vulnerability occurs because the Cisco ASA can write files to specific locations on the file system, and the smart tunnel functionality does not validate the integrity of system files that load during execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious system file and writing it to a specific location on the file system when a valid user is establishing the Cisco ASA smart tunnel connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the smart tunnel to load a malicious executable. The attacker needs valid device credentials on the local client device to exploit this vulnerability.  The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-1945  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases and the right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory and the release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities.  **Cisco ASA Software**       | Cisco ASA Software Release | First Fixed Release for These Vulnerabilities |   | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 9.41 | 9.4.4.37 |   | 9.4 | 9.4.4.37 |   | 9.51 | 9.6.4.30 |   | 9.6 | 9.6.4.30 |   | 9.71 | 9.8.4.7 |   | 9.8 | 9.8.4.7 |   | 9.9 | 9.10.1.22 |   | 9.10 | 9.10.1.22 |   | 9.12 | 9.12.2.1 |      1.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.7 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.
