Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-1621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control on the `/fm/downloadServlet` servlet in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM). This servlet allows users to download arbitrary files from the DCNM server's filesystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** The `DownloadServlet` does not properly validate or restrict the `showFile` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server.
*   **Insufficient Authentication:** In DCNM versions prior to 11.1(1), authentication is required to access the vulnerable servlet. However, in version 11.1(1), this restriction was removed, allowing unauthenticated access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to download any file on the DCNM server, including sensitive configuration files (e.g., `/usr/local/cisco/dcm/fm/conf/server.properties` which stores database credentials and the SFTP root password) and system files like `/etc/shadow`, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  By obtaining sensitive information such as database credentials or the SFTP root password, an attacker can gain further access to systems or elevate privileges within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **Direct Web Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable servlet, providing a path to the target file using the "showFile" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the DCNM server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access (for version 11.1(1)):** In DCNM version 11.1(1), no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Authenticated Access (for versions <= 11.0(1)):** In earlier versions, the attacker needs a valid user session.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory notes that a Metasploit module exists for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in DCNM version 11.2(1) by removing the vulnerable servlet altogether.
*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) software releases prior to Release 11.2(1). Specifically, it affects versions up to and including 11.1(1). In versions 11.0(1) and earlier, authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. However, in version 11.1(1), unauthenticated access is possible.

In summary, CVE-2019-1621 is a high severity vulnerability that enables unauthorized file access on vulnerable Cisco DCNM systems, due to insufficient access controls on a file download servlet.
