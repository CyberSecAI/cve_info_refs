Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a vulnerability within the Remote Desktop Services (RDS) of affected Microsoft Windows systems. This vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted requests to the target system via RDP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the target system.
- **Unauthenticated Access:**  An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Exposure:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network access to the Remote Desktop Service (port 3389/tcp).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) Impact:** The vulnerability impacts all three aspects of security: confidentiality (potential data disclosure), integrity (data manipulation), and availability (potential denial of service).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system, specifically port 3389/tcp, which is used by the RDP service.
- **Specially Crafted RDP Requests:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the target system's Remote Desktop Service via RDP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any user credentials or prior access to the system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the target system's RDP service (port 3389/tcp).

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is part of a set of four related vulnerabilities referred to as "DejaBlue"
- This particular CVE only affects products based on Windows 10.
- Microsoft has released patches to address the vulnerability and recommends that affected users apply those patches.

This information provides more detail than the basic description from the CVE record, specifically outlining the attack vector, the unauthenticated nature of the exploit, and the impact of arbitrary code execution.
