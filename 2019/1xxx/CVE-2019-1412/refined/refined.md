{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the handling of Type 1 fonts in the Windows kernel due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Improper validation of user-supplied data can lead to reading past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information and potentially escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel in conjunction with other vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system to trigger the vulnerability.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
