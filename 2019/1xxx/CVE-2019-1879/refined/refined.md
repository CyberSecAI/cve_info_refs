Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-1879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input at the CLI of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected device.
- Full control of the system by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the device.
- CLI: The vulnerability is triggered via the command-line interface of the IMC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated: The attacker must authenticate with administrator credentials via the CLI.
- Local Access: The attacker requires local access to the affected system.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) allows an authenticated local attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges due to insufficient input validation. This can lead to full system compromise.
