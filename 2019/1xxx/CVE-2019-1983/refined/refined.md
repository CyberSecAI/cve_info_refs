- No special privileges or user interaction is required from the target's side.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the affected software attempts to filter emails with malicious attachments.
- After process restarts due to the crash, the software attempts to re-process the same malicious attachment, leading to a recurring DoS.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability, and no workarounds are available.
- The vulnerability does not affect Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
