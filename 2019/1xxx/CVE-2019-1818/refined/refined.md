Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within HTTP request parameters that specify filenames. This allows for directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal techniques (e.g., "../") in file path parameters. This permits access to files outside the intended directory. (CWE-22)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to download and view application files that should be restricted. These files may contain sensitive information, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:**  Exploitation occurs through crafted HTTP requests containing malicious file paths within parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cisco Prime Infrastructure or Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager software.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

**Summary of the Vulnerability:**

This is a path traversal vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager software. An authenticated attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating HTTP request parameters containing filenames to access sensitive files outside the intended directory. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2019-1818.
