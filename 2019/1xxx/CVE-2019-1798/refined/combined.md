| [Description](#c0)  mikepolniak    2002-02-11 18:54:42 UTC  ``` A command line player and recorder of .wav files.        wavplay  plays  a  WAV format file to the audio device (by        default /dev/dsp ) reading WAV parameters from  the  input        file  header.   (Command-line  options will override these        defaults, if you know better or for special effects.)         wavrec samples the audio device and  writes  a  WAV  file.        Command-line  options  provide  complete  control over the        resolution and duration of sampling.         Both wavplay and wavrec  allow  the  audio  device  to  be        locked for exclusive access. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  mikepolniak    2002-02-11 18:56:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 164](attachment.cgi?id=164 "wavplay-1.4.ebuild (New Package)") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=164&action=edit "wavplay-1.4.ebuild (New Package)")] wavplay-1.4.ebuild (New Package) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  mikepolniak    2002-02-14 12:37:12 UTC  ``` Please note the attxhment #164 is a tar.gz of the wavplay-1.4.ebuild ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sascha Schwabbauer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-02-04 12:54:07 UTC  ``` hmm, i cant open the ebuild, please fix that.. and is this still the latest version of wavplay? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  mikepolniak    2003-02-04 14:07:15 UTC  ``` # Copyright 1999-2002 Gentoo Technologies, Inc. # Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, v2 or later # Author: mike polniak <mikpolniak@adelphia.net> # /space/gentoo/cvsroot/gentoo-x86/skel.ebuild,v 1.3 2002/02/04 15:46:51 gbevin Exp  S=${WORKDIR}/${P} DESCRIPTION="A command line player/recorder for wav files" SRC_URI="[http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/apps/sound/players/${P}.tar.gz](http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/apps/sound/players/%24%7BP%7D.tar.gz)" HOMEPAGE="<http://orphan//>" DEPEND="virtual/glibc"  src_compile() { 	make clean 	make no_x || die }  src_install () { 	mkdir -p ${D}usr/bin 	make INSTDIR=${D}usr/bin install_no_x \ 	setuid_root || die  	#If you compiled with the SCHED_PRIORITY macro 	#defined in the Makefile (default), then you'll         #be asked to make the program setuid root.
