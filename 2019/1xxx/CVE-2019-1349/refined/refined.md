{
  "CVE-2019-1349": {
    "description": "When submodules are cloned recursively, under certain circumstances Git could be fooled into using the same Git directory twice. We now require the directory to be empty.",
    "root_cause": "Git could be tricked into using a non-empty directory as a path for a submodule while recursively cloning a repository.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Insufficient checks on submodule paths"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially overwrite the .git directory and remotely execute code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Recursive clone of a malicious repository",
      "Abuse of NTFS Alternate Data Streams or synonymous directory names"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the content of a git repository, including the submodule definitions.",
    "notes": "This vulnerability mainly affects Git for Windows and any platform where Git clones onto a mounted network drive."
  }
