{
  "CVE-2019-1991": {
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `btif_dm_data_copy` function due to incorrect usage of a union when copying data. Variables were defined as subtypes of the union rather than as the union type, leading to potential buffer overflow if the subtype is cast to the union type.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Incorrect union usage"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted transmission via Bluetooth could trigger the vulnerable code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted Bluetooth transmission."
  }
