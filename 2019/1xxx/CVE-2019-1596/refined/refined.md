Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1596:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **incorrect permissions** assigned to a system executable within the Bash shell implementation of Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-732):** The system executable has overly permissive settings, allowing a low-privileged user to potentially manipulate it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated local attacker can escalate their privileges to the `root` level, gaining full control over the affected device.
*   **Complete System Compromise (C:H/I:H/A:H):** With root access, the attacker could potentially:
    *   Read sensitive system data (Confidentiality Impact: High).
    *   Modify critical system configurations (Integrity Impact: High).
    *   Cause a denial of service by crashing or shutting down the device (Availability Impact: High).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker must have local access to the device's Bash shell.
*   **Crafted Command:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by executing a specially crafted command at the Bash prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to authenticate to the Cisco NX-OS device.
*   **Access to Bash Shell:** The attacker needs access to the Bash shell, which is typically available to users with `dev-ops` or `network-admin` roles.
*   **Low Privilege Account (PR:L):** The attacker only needs a low privileged account to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than applying the vendor provided patch.
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects several Cisco Nexus series switches running vulnerable releases of NX-OS software. The specific affected products are:
    *   Nexus 3000 Series Switches
    *   Nexus 3500 Platform Switches
    *   Nexus 3600 Platform Switches
    *   Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode
    *   Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
