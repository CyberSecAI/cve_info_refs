Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1694:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of TCP traffic within the TCP processing engine of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper handling of TCP traffic.
-  Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of TCP packets.
-  The vulnerability resides in the TCP processing engine which is responsible for managing TCP connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause an affected device to reload.
- This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, disrupting traffic through the device while it reboots.
- The impact is a temporary disruption of service due to the device rebooting.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Remote network attack.
-  The attacker sends a specific sequence of packets at a high rate through the affected device.
-  The attack is performed over the network, requiring no local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
- No authentication is required.
- Attacker needs to be able to generate a specific sequence of TCP packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered if a TCP protocol is configured for inspection.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability affects several Cisco products running vulnerable versions of ASA and FTD software, including both physical and virtual appliances.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
