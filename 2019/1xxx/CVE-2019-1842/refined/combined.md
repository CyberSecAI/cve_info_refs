| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.4 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.4 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR Software Secure Shell Authentication Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190605-iosxr-ssh  First Published: 2019 June 5 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvo03672](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo03672)     CVE-2019-1842     CWE-287       CVSS Score: [Base 5.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-1842     CWE-287       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-iosxr-ssh/csaf/cisco-sa-20190605-iosxr-ssh.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) authentication function of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to successfully log in to an affected device using two distinct usernames.  See the [Details](#details) section for more information.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.      This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-iosxr-ssh>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software when the SSH server is enabled.  For information about affected software releases, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section in this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The impacts of this vulnerability when the SSH server is enabled are as follows:    + Some logged events will be attributed to the impersonated user. **Example:** Authenticated Attacker A who is assigned the *operator* task group exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B who is assigned the *sysadmin* task group. In this case, the attacker could execute all commands that are assigned to the *operator* task group, but the commands would be reported as being issued by Admin B.    + Username and user task group enumeration can be performed. **Example:** Authenticated Attacker A exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B. If Attacker A issues the CLI command **show user** , relevant information for Admin B will be returned. If the Admin B username does not exist, the command will not be executed.  Additionally, if the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) command authorization feature is enabled with the configuration command **aaa authorization commands** , AAA command authorization bypass can occur.  The vulnerability is due to a logic error that results in the authenticated username being tied to the correct task groups; however, the alternate username is tied to the command authorization requests. The attacker will always retain the task groups that they were assigned as part of the successful authenticated username.  The impact of this vulnerability if the command being executed by the authenticated attacker is allowed as part of their task group configuration and AAA command authorization is configured on the device, is as follows:    + The command will be sent to the AAA server to validate that the command is authorized. This authorization request will be sent as the impersonated username, which may allow the authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands. **Example:** Authenticated Attacker A who is assigned the *operator* task group exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B who is assigned the *sysadmin* task group. If Attacker A tries to execute a command that is not allowed by the *operator* task group, but is authorized to the *sysadmin* group, the command will not be authorized and is not sent to the AAA server for authorization.    **Example:** Authenticated Attacker A who is assigned the *operator* task group, but with command restrictions imposed via their AAA profile, exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B who is assigned the *operator* task group, but with no command restrictions imposed via their AAA profile. If Attacker A tries to execute a command that is allowed by the *operator* task group, but not allowed in their AAA profile, the command will be authorized because the command authorization check is performed using the Admin B username.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco will release [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  **Customers Without Service Contracts**  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
