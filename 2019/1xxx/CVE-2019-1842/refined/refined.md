Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1842:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A logic error occurs during SSH login, where the authenticated username is correctly associated with its task groups, but an alternate username is used for command authorization requests. This allows an attacker to potentially execute commands authorized for the alternate user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect association of usernames and task groups:** The vulnerability stems from the SSH server incorrectly tying the authenticated user's task group permissions to the command authorization requests of an impersonated username.
- **Authentication bypass:** While not a complete authentication bypass, the attacker leverages their authenticated session to perform actions under another user's identity.
- **AAA command authorization bypass:** If AAA command authorization is enabled (using `aaa authorization commands`), the system bypasses authorization checks based on the authenticated user's AAA profile and instead uses the impersonated username for authorization requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Logging data misrepresentation:** Logged events are attributed to the impersonated user, not the attacker, which can hinder proper auditing and tracing.
- **User enumeration:** Attackers can enumerate usernames and their task group assignments via commands like `show user`, due to the impersonation.
- **Command authorization bypass:** Attackers can execute commands not permitted by their own task group or AAA profile but authorized for the impersonated username.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attacker needs to establish an SSH session with the affected device remotely.
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the device using SSH.
- **Specific sequence of actions:** The attacker needs to follow a specific sequence of actions during the SSH login process to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Awareness of target user:**  The attacker can enumerate users and potentially leverage the impersonation to run commands permitted by the impersonated user.
