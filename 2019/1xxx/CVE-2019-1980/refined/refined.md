Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1980

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper detection of the initial use of a protocol on a nonstandard port. This means that when a specific protocol is used for the first time on a port that is not its usual default port, the affected software fails to recognize it correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Non-standard protocol detection bypass:** The core issue is that the software's protocol detection mechanism fails when a protocol is initiated on a non-standard port.
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-264):** By exploiting the bypass, an attacker could potentially access protected systems or resources that should otherwise be blocked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Filtering Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the security filtering mechanisms of the affected Cisco devices.
- **Delivery of Malicious Requests:** This bypass can be used to send malicious traffic to protected systems behind the firewall or security device.
- **Compromise of Protected Systems:** Ultimately, a successful exploit can lead to the compromise of internal systems that were intended to be protected by the affected Cisco products.
- **Limited Impact:** Once the initial protocol flow is detected, future flows on the non-standard port will be handled by the applied policy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker sends traffic over the network to the vulnerable Cisco device.
- **Non-standard port:** The attack relies on using a non-standard port for a specific protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** No prior authentication is required, and the attacker can be located remotely from the targeted Cisco device.
- **Ability to send network traffic:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable device.
- **Knowledge of the protocol:** The attacker needs to know which protocol to use in the attack.
