Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure removal of cleartext encryption keys stored on local partitions of the hard drive in affected Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Insecure storage of encryption keys: Encryption keys are stored in cleartext on local disk partitions and are not properly removed, even after they are no longer needed, thereby remaining accessible to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Confidential Information Disclosure:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can retrieve encryption keys. These keys could potentially be used to decrypt other data and sensitive information stored on the device, ultimately leading to the disclosure of confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attack requires physical access to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Local Physical Access:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the Cisco APIC device to retrieve data from the physical disk.
-  **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) associated with this vulnerability is CWE-320 (Key Management Errors).
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.6, with a vector string of CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
