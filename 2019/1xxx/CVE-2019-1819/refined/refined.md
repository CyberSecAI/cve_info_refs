Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied input within HTTP request parameters that are intended to represent filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary weakness is a path traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input parameters to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to download and view application files that should be restricted. These files may contain sensitive information.
- **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to modify files or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out by manipulating HTTP request parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Prime Infrastructure or Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager software.
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system over a network.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Prime Infrastructure releases prior to 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager releases prior to 3.0.1.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, and the advisory includes links to obtain the updates.
- The CVSS base score is 6.5 (Medium), with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
