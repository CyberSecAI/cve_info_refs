Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1583:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an HTML injection flaw within the Twistlock Console. This allows for a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTML Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering HTML, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/script code.
- **DOM-based XSS:** The injected script executes client-side in the user's browser when a victim interacts with the affected component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:**  A Twistlock user with "Operator" capabilities can escalate their privileges to those of another user. This is achieved by injecting malicious code that executes in the context of the victim user's session.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact**: The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability. This suggests an attacker can gain access to sensitive information, modify data and cause disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **User Interaction:**  Successful exploitation requires the victim to interact with the vulnerable component. This implies that a user must click a link or perform some other action that would trigger the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** An attacker needs only "Operator" privileges within Twistlock, which is a relatively low level of access.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Twistlock console.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker also needs a victim to interact with the malicious code injected into the system.

**Affected Product and Versions:**
- Twistlock Console versions 19.07.357 and earlier are affected.
- Twistlock Console versions 19.07.358 and later are unaffected.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered externally and reported by William Wirahasbianto.
- The provided CVSS score is 8, which is rated as High severity.
- The identified weakness type is CWE-264 (Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls).
