    "cve": "CVE-2019-1749",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the ingress traffic validation of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 900 Route Switch Processor 3 (RSP3) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "root_cause": "The software insufficiently validates ingress traffic on the ASIC used on the RSP3 platform.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of ingress traffic"
    ],
     "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a reload of the *iosd* process, triggering a device reload and resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPF version 2 (OSPFv2) message to an affected device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected device and unauthenticated.",
    "affected_products": "Cisco ASR 900 RSP3 devices that are running Cisco IOS XE Software and are configured for OSPFv2 routing and OSPF Message Digest 5 (MD5) cryptographic authentication."
    ,
    "additional_notes": [
        "Devices configured for OSPFv2 routing and Hashed Message Authentication Code-Secure Hash Algorithm (HMAC-SHA) cryptographic authentication are not affected.",
        "No workarounds available.",
        "This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case."
