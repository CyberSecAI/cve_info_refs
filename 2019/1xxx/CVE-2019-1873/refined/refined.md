- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incomplete input validation of a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) ingress packet header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation in the cryptographic driver for Cisco ASA and FTD software when processing SSL/TLS packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted TLS/SSL packet to an interface of the targeted device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an interface of the targeted device, and a valid SSL or TLS session is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
