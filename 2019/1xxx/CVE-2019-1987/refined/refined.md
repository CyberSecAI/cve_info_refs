Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1987:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in Skia's PNG decoding functionality. Specifically, when sampling during the decoding process, the offset ends up the same as the width of the image data. This leads to the read operation going beyond the allocated buffer if not handled properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Heap buffer overflow:** A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to incorrect offset calculation during image sampling within the PNG decoding process.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted PNG file, which would allow them to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Specially crafted PNG file:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted PNG image file to a vulnerable application that utilizes Skia's PNG decoding library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted PNG file to a vulnerable application. This might involve:
   - Sending it over a network (e.g., through a web browser loading an image).
   - Delivering it locally through another app.

**Additional Details:**
The provided information also suggests that the vulnerability occurs due to how the sampling offset is handled when downsampling, which leads to the offset being equivalent to the width of the image, causing the overflow when reading. The fix involves ensuring that the offset calculations are handled correctly during sampling to avoid reading beyond the buffer boundaries. The fix also addresses issues related to uninitialized errors within the SkPngCodec, making sure the row decoded variable is initialized to prevent use of uninitialized values. In addition, it makes sure that if an error is hit during decoding, the code sets the row decoded value correctly to stop further errors.
