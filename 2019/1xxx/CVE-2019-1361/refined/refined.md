Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing cursor files in the user32 library. This can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability during the parsing of cursor files.

Impact of exploitation: An attacker can disclose sensitive information by triggering the out-of-bounds read. This can potentially be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.

Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered by a user visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file containing a crafted cursor file.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to lure a user to interact with a malicious page or file, implying no special network position is required, but user interaction is.
