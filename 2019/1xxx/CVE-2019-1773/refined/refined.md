Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-1773:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists because the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player improperly validate Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

Improper validation of ARF and WRF file formats. This is a classic case of a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption vulnerability (CWE-119).

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This means the attacker could potentially gain complete control of the user's computer.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or email attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker needs to persuade the user to open the malicious ARF or WRF file with the vulnerable software on their local system. No specific privileges are needed and the user must interact with the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need to be on the same network, and a local attack is possible through the user's local storage (downloaded files).
