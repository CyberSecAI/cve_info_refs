Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the CLI of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, which arises because the software doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in commands.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of arguments passed to specific commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution as Root:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. This means the attacker can gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CLI:** The attack vector is through the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco FTD software.
- **Command Argument Injection:** Attackers inject malicious commands into the arguments of a specific vulnerable CLI command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
- **Privileged User:** The provided CVSS vector indicates that the attacker would require High privileges, or more likely a privileged user account.
