Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insufficient authentication mechanism within the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) console implementation of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication:** The primary weakness is the inadequate authentication process used to establish a VNC session. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   **Missing Access Control:** The VNC console session does not properly restrict access, allowing unauthorized interception and interaction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can gain access to the VNC console session of an administrative user.
*   **Session Monitoring:** The attacker can passively observe the administrator's console session, potentially gaining sensitive information.
*   **Session Interaction:** The attacker can actively interact with the console session, effectively gaining administrative access to the affected device. This allows for full control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Interception of VNC Request:** The attacker intercepts a legitimate administrator's VNC session request before the administrator logs in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected device.
*   **Ability to Intercept VNC Requests:** The attacker must be able to intercept VNC session requests before the legitimate administrator.
*   **No prior authentication** is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) releases prior to 3.12.1 are vulnerable.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates (3.12.1 and later) to address this issue.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, rated as Critical.
*   **CWE:** CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) is associated with this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing.
