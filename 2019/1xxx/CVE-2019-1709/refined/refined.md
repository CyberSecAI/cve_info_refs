Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1709

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the CLI of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing specific CLI commands. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into arguments of these commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation enables the attacker to execute commands with *root* privileges on the affected system. This could lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to perform various malicious activities, including data theft, system modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have direct access to the device or access via a management interface within the local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated and have a high level of privileges on the affected Cisco FTD device. Specifically, they need to have access to the CLI.

**Summary of Information:**

The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software CLI. An authenticated local attacker can exploit this by injecting commands into the arguments of certain CLI commands due to insufficient input validation. Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining root privileges on the system. This vulnerability affects various versions of Cisco FTD software prior to 6.2.3.12 and does not affect Cisco ASA software. There are no known workarounds, and a software update is required to fix the vulnerability.
