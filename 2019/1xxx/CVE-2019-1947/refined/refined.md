Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of email messages containing large attachments within the email message filtering feature of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of large email attachments.
- Lack of proper resource management when processing large attachments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100%, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The DoS condition may be permanent and require manual intervention to recover the ESA.
-  The high CPU utilization can also lead to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a malicious email message containing a large attachment through the targeted device (Cisco ESA).
- The attack is remote and unauthenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send email messages to the Cisco ESA.
- No authentication is required, meaning the attacker does not need to be internal to the network.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Products**: Cisco AsyncOS Software 12.1.0-085 and 11.1.0-131 for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) are affected.
- **Unaffected Products**:  Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) and Web Security Appliance (WSA) are not affected.
- **Indicator of Compromise:** High CPU utilization, specifically in the MGA CPU field, as shown in the output of the `status detail` command in the Cisco ESA CLI.
- **CVSS Score:**  Base score of 8.6 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)
- **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to address this vulnerability.
- **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco AsyncOS Software for ESA 12.5.0-059 and later.
