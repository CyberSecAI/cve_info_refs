Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a logic error within the internal packet-processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. This error can prevent the replenishment of ingress buffers under specific traffic conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Logic Error:** A flaw in the logic of how ingress buffers are managed.
*   **Input Buffer Exhaustion:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to consume all available input buffers, which are shared across all active interfaces.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a queue wedge condition in all active interfaces, causing the affected device to stop processing any incoming traffic. The device will remain in a DoS condition until manually reloaded.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker sends a series of specifically crafted packets to the targeted device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the device remotely without prior authentication.
*  **Ability to craft specific packets:** The attacker must be able to craft packets that will trigger the logic error.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Firepower 2100 Series devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco FTD software. Specifically, versions 6.2.1, 6.2.2, and 6.2.3 are affected.
*   **Unaffected Products:** Cisco ASA 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services, ASA Software, Firepower Management Center, Firepower 4100 Series, FirePOWER 7000/8000/9300 Series Appliances, and FirePOWER Threat Defense for ISRs are not affected.
*   **Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to version 6.2.3.12 or later or 6.3.0.3.

This analysis provides more detail than the CVE description, clarifying the nature of the logic error, the mechanism of buffer exhaustion, and the specific affected and unaffected products.
