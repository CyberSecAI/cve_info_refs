Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1851:

*   **Vulnerability:** Cisco Identity Services Engine Arbitrary Client Certificate Creation Vulnerability
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) in the External RESTful Services (ERS) API of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
*   **Weakness:** Improper control of generation of arbitrary certificates signed by the Internal Certificate Authority (CA) Services on ISE. (CWE-285)
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific HTTP request with administrative credentials to the ERS API. The ERS API must be enabled on the ISE deployment.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to generate a certificate that is signed and trusted by the ISE CA with arbitrary attributes. The attacker could use this certificate to access other networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.
*   **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available to address this vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco ISE deployments with the ERS API enabled are affected.
*   **Fixed Software:** Consult the Cisco bug ID (CSCvm81230) for information about fixed software releases.
