{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the DWASSVC service due to a size mismatch when handling inter-process communication messages via named pipes. Specifically, the service allocates memory based on the data length provided in the message but copies data using a different, larger size, allowing for out-of-bounds writes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow",
    "Improper calculation of buffer size",
    "Lack of input validation on named pipe messages",
     "Privilege escalation via named pipe access"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute code with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges, allowing full control over the affected machine. In shared hosting environments, it could lead to the compromise of other tenants' applications, data, and accounts, breaking the security model of the App Service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted message to the named pipe used for communication between the DWASSVC service and the worker process (w3wp.exe).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute code within an Azure App Service environment, specifically within a worker process (w3wp.exe). This allows the attacker to enumerate open handles, find the named pipe handle and send malicious messages to trigger the overflow. This could be achieved by deploying a malicious application to the App Service."
