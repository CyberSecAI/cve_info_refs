Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Webex Teams client using unsafe search paths within its application URI handler, specifically on Windows operating systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Library Loading:** The application is vulnerable to loading libraries from directories specified in the URI link. This is due to improper handling of search paths by the URI handler.
*   **Unsafe Search Paths:** The application's URI handler uses unsafe search paths that can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted system with the privileges of the user running Webex Teams.
*   **Compromise of System:** The attacker can gain control of the user's system by loading malicious libraries.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, which are all rated as "High" in the CVSS score.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker convinces a user to click a malicious link containing a crafted URI.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to place the malicious library in a directory accessible to the vulnerable system.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The targeted user must click the malicious link to initiate the exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious link that includes a specific URI targeting a directory they control.
*   The attacker must be able to place a malicious library file in a directory that is accessible by the targeted user's system.
*   The attacker must convince the user to click on the malicious link, triggering the vulnerable URI handler.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Cisco Webex Teams prior to version 3.0.10260.
*   There are no known workarounds.
*   Cisco has released updates to address this vulnerability.
*   A public announcement of exploit methods has been made, but there are no reports of malicious use.
* The CVSS score is 7.8, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
