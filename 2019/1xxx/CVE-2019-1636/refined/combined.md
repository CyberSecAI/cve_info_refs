This vulnerability is due to unsafe search paths used by the application URI that is defined in Windows operating systems. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could cause the application to load libraries from the directory targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this behavior to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the targeted user if the attacker can place a crafted library in a directory that is accessible to the vulnerable system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects all versions of Cisco Webex Teams prior to version 3.0.10260, which was released on November 21, 2018.  To determine which Cisco Webex Teams version is running, users can click their profile picture, which is between the **Home** icon and search field in the application window. The user can choose **Help > About** to view the version information, which is similar to the following:  Webex Teams   Version: 3.0.10260.0 Products Confirmed Not VulnerableOnly products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco Webex Teams versions 3.0.10260 (released on November 21, 2018) and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.  Customers are advised to upgrade to the latest version of Cisco Webex Teams. In the left panel of the app, click the **Refresh** icon (the circular green arrow) and then click **Update**. If the **Refresh** icon is not present, there is no update pending.  For more information, see the Cisco Webex Teams help article [Update the Cisco Webex Teams App to the Latest Release](https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/g1otrv).  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is aware of a public announcement that demonstrates exploit methods related to this vulnerability. However, there have been no reports of malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  Source  * Cisco would like to thank rgod of 9sg Security Team, working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, for reporting the vulnerability.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator: Â  Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent AV:Â Network AV:Â Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC:Â Low AC:Â High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR:Â None PR:Â Low PR:Â High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI:Â Required UI:Â None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S:Â Unchanged S:Â Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Low C:Â High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Low I:Â High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Low A:Â High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:Â Unknown  RC:Â Reasonable  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV:Â Local  MAV:Â Adjacent  MAV:Â Network  MAV:Â Physical  MAV:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC:Â Low  MAC:Â High  MAC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR:Â None  MPR:Â Low  MPR:Â High  MPR:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI:Â Required  MUI:Â None  MUI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS:Â Unchanged  MS:Â Changed  MS:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC:Â None  MC:Â Low  MC:Â High  MC:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI:Â None  MI:Â Low  MI:Â High  MI:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA:Â None  MA:Â Low  MA:Â High  MA:Â Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.8 |
