# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.5 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.5 |

For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco FTD Software:    + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Firewalls   + ASA 5500-X Series with FirePOWER Services   + Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks for FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances   + AMP for Networks for FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances   + FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + Firepower Threat Defense for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)   + FTD Virtual (FTDv)   + Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) For information about which Cisco FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  These vulnerabilities may also affect the open-source Snort project. For more information, see the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/). Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release To determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:  ```   > show version      ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------   Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)   UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c   Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt   VDB version : 279   ----------------------------------------------------   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco has confirmed that these vulnerabilities do not affect the following Cisco products:    + Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software   + Firepower Management Center   + Meraki MX Security Appliances  Details  * Two vulnerabilities in the SMB Protocol preprocessor detection engine for Cisco FTD Software could allow an adjacent or remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.  The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.  Details about the vulnerabilities are as follows.  **Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SMB Protocol Preprocessor Detection Engine Low System Memory Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the SMB Protocol preprocessor detection engine for Cisco FTD Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the device to run low on system memory, which may cause the device to stop forwarding traffic. A manual reload of the device may be required to clear the condition.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect SMB ingress packet processing for specific SMB packet types. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted SMB packets to the targeted device from the local subnet. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to run low on system memory, which could prevent the Snort process from forwarding traffic. This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 or IPv6 with either SMB Version 2 (SMBv2) or SMB Version 3 (SMBv3) network traffic.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-1696  The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: High  **Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SMB Protocol Preprocessor Detection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability**  A vulnerability in the SMB Protocol preprocessor detection engine for Cisco FTD Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Snort process to unexpectedly restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect SMB ingress packet processing for specific SMB packet types. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SMB connection to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort process to crash. This vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 or IPv6 with either SMBv2 or SMBv3 network traffic.  The CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2019-1704  The SIR for this vulnerability is: High  Indicators of Compromise  * The Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SMB Protocol Preprocessor Detection Engine Low System Memory Denial of Service Vulnerability could cause the device to run low on system memory, which could cause the Snort process to restart unexpectedly. If the following error log is observed, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to determine whether the vulnerability has been exploited on the device.  ```   Firepower-module1 kernel: [1111040.969265] snort invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0xd0, order=0, oom_score_adj=0   ```  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to [upgrade to an appropriate release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in the applicable table in this section.
