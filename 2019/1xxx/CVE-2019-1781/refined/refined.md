Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient validation of arguments passed to certain CLI commands within Cisco FXOS and NX-OS software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system via CLI commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.
- Full System Compromise: This can potentially lead to a full compromise of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the affected device.
- CLI Access: The attacker exploits the vulnerabilities through the CLI interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated: The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to access the CLI.
- Local Access: Physical or direct console access to the vulnerable device is needed.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is present in multiple Cisco products running vulnerable versions of FXOS and NX-OS software.
- The provided document lists several related command injection vulnerabilities identified by different CVE and Cisco bug IDs, some affecting different product sets.
- There are no known workarounds to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to fix the vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.7 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, although requiring local access and high privileges.
