  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of DirectComposition PropertySet objects in the kernel. The issue results from a failure to guard critical data from being modified while the kernel is performing an operation, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure.",
  "root_cause": "A race condition exists within the handling of DirectComposition PropertySet objects in the kernel where critical data is not properly guarded from modification while the kernel is performing an operation.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Race condition",
    "Lack of proper synchronization/locking",
    "Write past the end of an allocated data structure"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
  "attack_vectors": "Local access. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
  "required_capabilities": "Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
