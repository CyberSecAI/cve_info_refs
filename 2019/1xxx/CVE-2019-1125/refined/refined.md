    "description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.Security Fix(es):* kernel: hw: Spectre SWAPGS gadget vulnerability (CVE-2019-1125)",
    "root_cause": "A newly swapped “GS” value is used to perform accesses to kernel data, using the PER_CPU macros contained within the kernel. The “SWAPGS” instruction was added as part of the mechanism to transition from userspace to kernel space, which determines a convention to find kernel data such as kernel stack data. The SWAPGS instruction is a primitive instruction and does not validate the correctness of the values it uses. There are cases where the system may enter kernel code but may not require the swap or may re-enter kernel mode when already running in kernel mode.",
