Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1730

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of a CLI command within the Guest Shell of Cisco NX-OS Software. This allows a Bash command to be improperly invoked from the Guest Shell CLI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect CLI Implementation:** A flaw in how a specific CLI command is implemented enables the bypass of restrictions.
- **Bash Command Invocation:** The vulnerability allows arbitrary Bash commands to be executed from within the Guest Shell.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can leverage this to execute commands with the privileges of a network-admin user, which is higher than what should be allowed in the Guest Shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Guest Shell Restrictions:**  An attacker can bypass the intended limitations of a Guest Shell account.
- **Unauthorized Command Execution:** Ability to execute commands that should be restricted, gaining broader control over the device.
- **Potential System Compromise:** The ability to execute privileged commands could lead to further compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device.
- **Guest Shell CLI:** The attack is initiated via the Guest Shell CLI prompt.
- **Crafted Command:** Exploitation requires entering a crafted command at the Guest Shell prompt to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the device using valid administrator credentials.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to access the Guest Shell on the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus Series switches running vulnerable versions of NX-OS Software.
- The Bash shell, normally accessible only to "dev-ops" or "network-admin" roles, can be accessed improperly by exploiting this vulnerability in the Guest Shell
- No workarounds are available.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
