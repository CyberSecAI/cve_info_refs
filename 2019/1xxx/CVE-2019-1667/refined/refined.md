Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient authorization controls in the Graphite interface of Cisco HyperFlex software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The Graphite service lacks proper authorization checks, allowing an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions.
*   **Arbitrary Data Write:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary data to the Graphite interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write arbitrary data to Graphite, which could result in the presentation of invalid statistics within the interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker must connect to the Graphite service.
*   The attacker sends arbitrary data to the service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected system.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated.

**Additional Notes**
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
*   The base CVSS v3 score is 4.0 (Medium Severity) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

The provided information aligns with the official CVE description by describing a vulnerability in Cisco HyperFlex software that allows an attacker to write arbitrary data due to insufficient authorization controls.
