ID: CVE-2019-1732
Description: A vulnerability in the Remote Package Manager (RPM) subsystem of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator credentials to leverage a time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition to corrupt local variables, which could lead to arbitrary command injection.

- Root cause of vulnerability: Lack of a proper locking mechanism on critical variables that need to stay static until used.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: TOCTOU race condition.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary command injection.
- Attack vectors: Authenticating to an affected device and issuing a set of RPM-related CLI commands.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Authenticated, local attacker with administrator credentials.
