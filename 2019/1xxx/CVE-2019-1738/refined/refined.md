Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-1738, CVE-2019-1739 and CVE-2019-1740:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerabilities are caused by a parsing issue in the Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) feature when processing DNS packets.

**Weaknesses:**
- Improper parsing of crafted DNS packets.
- Lack of proper input validation of DNS packets in the NBAR feature.

**Impact:**
- A successful exploit can cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker can send crafted DNS packets.
- The malicious packets need to pass through a router that is running an affected version of Cisco IOS or IOS XE software.
- The router must have the NBAR feature enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated remote attacker.
- Ability to send crafted DNS packets to a vulnerable device.
- No specific privileges or user interaction are required.

**Additional Details:**

-  The advisory explicitly states that there are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities besides disabling NBAR.
- A successful exploit will cause an affected device to reload and generate a crashinfo file.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerabilities were discovered during the resolution of a support case.
- The vulnerabilities affect routers running vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software with NBAR enabled.
- Cisco IOS XR and Cisco NX-OS Software are not affected.

**CVE IDs Mapping:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2019-1738, CVE-2019-1739, and CVE-2019-1740 are all related to the same underlying issue of parsing DNS packets within the NBAR feature, and all have the same impact, attack vector and required capabilities. They are all addressed by the same fix. They are associated with the same Cisco Bug IDs.

**CVSS Score:**
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.6, with a vector of `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H`. This indicates a high severity vulnerability due to the potential for a denial of service.
