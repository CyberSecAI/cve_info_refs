Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A logic error exists in the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) related to the processing of different types of input packets. This logic error is present in the ingress buffer management of the FPGA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The primary weakness is the logic error within the FPGA's ingress buffer management. This error allows a specific sequence of crafted input packets to cause a queue wedge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit causes a queue wedge condition on the affected interface.
*   When a queue wedge occurs, the device stops processing any additional packets received on that interface, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   Manual intervention, potentially including a device reboot, may be required to restore normal operation.
*  The input discard or overrun interface counters will increase exponentially.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker must be on the adjacent subnet to the affected device.
*   The attacker needs to send a crafted sequence of input packets to a specific interface on the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a network presence on the same subnet as the affected device (adjacent network).
*   The attacker must be able to send network packets to the device.
*   No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Firepower 9000 Series with the Cisco Firepower 2-port 100G double-width network module (PID: FPR9K-DNM-2X100G)

**Not Affected Products:**

* Firepower 2100 Series
* Firepower 4100 Series

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by an FPGA firmware upgrade, not an FXOS software upgrade.
*   There are no known workarounds that address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
