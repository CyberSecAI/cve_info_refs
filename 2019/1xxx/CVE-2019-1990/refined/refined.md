    "description": "The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2019-03-05 or later address all of these issues.  The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in Media framework that could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to signal `IVD_RES_CHANGED` when crop parameters change, which could lead to out-of-bounds write issues. Specifically, the decoder may allocate an output buffer based on the current dimensions being decoded. If the display dimensions change without signaling `IVD_RES_CHANGED` and the new buffer size is smaller than the frame being returned, an out-of-bounds write can occur.",
    "vulnerabilities": [

    "impact": "Remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control of an affected device.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted file to the vulnerable device to trigger the out of bounds write vulnerability.",
