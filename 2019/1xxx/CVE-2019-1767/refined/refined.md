Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command in Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow (CWE-119):  A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of input passed to a specific CLI command.
- Command injection (CWE-77): The insufficient input validation also makes the system vulnerable to command injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with *root* privileges on the underlying operating system.
- Full system compromise:  The ability to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges could lead to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: The attacker needs to be on the local network with access to the affected device.
- CLI command: The vulnerabilities are triggered by crafting a malicious input argument to a specific CLI command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs valid administrator credentials to exploit these vulnerabilities.
- Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable device.
