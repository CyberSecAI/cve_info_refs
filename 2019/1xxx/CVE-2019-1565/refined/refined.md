Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw within the External Dynamic Lists feature of PAN-OS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Neutralization:** The system fails to properly neutralize input when generating web pages. Specifically, user-provided data within External Dynamic Lists is not sanitized, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability type is a classic XSS vulnerability, where malicious scripts can be injected into a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript/HTML Injection:** A successful attack allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML into the affected PAN-OS web interface.
*   **Compromised User Sessions:** This could potentially lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, stealing of sensitive information, or defacement of the interface when a user interacts with the maliciously crafted element.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker would typically need network access to the affected system.
*   **External Dynamic Lists:**  The vulnerability exists in how PAN-OS handles input to External Dynamic Lists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:**  The attacker must be an authenticated user of the PAN-OS device.
*   **Write Privileges:** The attacker must have write privileges to External Dynamic List configurations.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, meaning that an unsuspecting user has to view a web page that includes malicious code injected through an External Dynamic List.

**Affected Versions:**

*   PAN-OS 7.1.21 and earlier
*   PAN-OS 8.0.14 and earlier
*   PAN-OS 8.1.5 and earlier

**Resolution:**

*   The vulnerability is resolved in PAN-OS 7.1.22 and later, PAN-OS 8.0.15 and later, and PAN-OS 8.1.6 and later.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text includes a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4, which is rated as MEDIUM severity.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in production use.
