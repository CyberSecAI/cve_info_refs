| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.4 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.4 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.4 |

"text": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific EVPN routing information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network.\r\n\r\nA successful exploit could result in a crash of the l2vpn\_mgr process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI). On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-evpn-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-evpn-dos\"]"

"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and are participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS XR Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determining Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration\r\nThere are two methods for determining whether the device has a vulnerable configuration.\r\n\r\nOption 1: Using the show evpn evi | include EVPN command\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show evpn evi | include EVPN command to determine whether the device is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show evpn evi | i EVPN\r\nTue May 14 09:40:09.277 EST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVPN-ID Encap Bridge Domain Type\r\n---------- ------ ---------------------------- -------------------  MPLS  EVPN\r\n\r\nIf this command does not exist, or if it produces an output that does not show the string EVPN within the Type column, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Using the show running-config formal l2vpn | include \"l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+\" command\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show running-config formal l2vpn | include \"l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+\" command to determine whether the device is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show running-config formal l2vpn | include \"l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+\"\r\nl2vpn bridge group bridge-domain evi\r\n\r\nAn empty output of this command indicates that the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nNote: Some hardware/software combinations may not support the show running-config formal command. In that case, use the verification step indicated in Option 1.\r\n Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release\r\n To determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the System image file is text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.5.2:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version\r\nTue May 14 01:32:32.751 EST Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 6.5.2[Default] Copyright (c) 2019 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

"text": "EVPN is a next-generation solution that provides Ethernet multipoint services over MPLS networks. In EVPN, customers' MAC addresses are used as routable addresses. PE devices participating in an EVI use Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) as a route learning and distribution mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific MP-BGP EVPN update messages. An attacker that controls multiple Customer Edge (CE) devices could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the EVPN network. An exploit could cause the Provider Edge (PE) device to advertise specific MP-BGP EVPN update messages that could result in a crash of the l2vpn\_mgr process on PE device members of the same EVI."

The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific EVPN routing information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network.  A successful exploit could result in a crash of the *l2vpn\_mgr* process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI). On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and are participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.  For information about which Cisco IOS XR Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determining Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration There are two methods for determining whether the device has a vulnerable configuration.  *Option 1: Using the **show evpn evi |** **include EVPN** command*  Administrators can use the **show evpn evi | include EVPN** command to determine whether the device is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show evpn evi | i EVPN   Tue May 14 09:40:09.277 EST      ```        ```   VPN-ID     Encap     Bridge Domain                Type   ---------- ------ ---------------------------- -------------------      MPLS                           EVPN   ```  If this command does not exist, or if it produces an output that does not show the string **EVPN** within the Type column, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.  *Option 2: Using the **show running-config formal l2vpn | include "l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+"** command*  Administrators can use the **show running-config formal l2vpn | include "l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+"** command to determine whether the device is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.   The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI:  ```   RP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show running-config formal l2vpn | include "l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+"   l2vpn bridge group  bridge-domain  evi    ```  An empty output of this command indicates that the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.  **Note**: Some hardware/software combinations may *not* support the **show running-config formal** command. In that case, use the verification step indicated in *Option 1.* Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show version** command in the CLI. If the device is running *Cisco IOS XR Software* or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the *System image file* is text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.  The following example shows the output of the **show version** command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.5.2:  ```   RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version   Tue May 14 01:32:32.751 EST      Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 6.5.2[Default]   Copyright (c) 2019 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Configuration register on node 0/RSP0/CPU0 is 0x2102    ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect devices running Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Details  * EVPN is a next-generation solution that provides Ethernet multipoint services over MPLS networks. In EVPN, customers' MAC addresses are used as routable addresses. PE devices participating in an EVI use Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) as a route learning and distribution mechanism.  The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific MP-BGP EVPN update messages. An attacker that controls multiple Customer Edge (CE) devices could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the EVPN network. An exploit could cause the Provider Edge (PE) device to advertise specific MP-BGP EVPN update messages that could result in a crash of the *l2vpn\_mgr* process on PE device members of the same EVI.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the affected device to repeatedly generate an error message similar to the following:  ```   RP/0/RP0/CPU0:May 14 15:41:03.241 IST: syslog_dev[117]: l2vpn_mgr[1265] PID-8642:   l2vpn/evpn/include/evpn_label_db_defs.h: 412 FALSE -- assertion failed   ```  Customers are advised to contact their support organization to review the error message and determine whether the device has been affected by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:      <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner.
