CVE-2019-1849: Cisco IOS XR Software BGP MPLS-Based EVPN Denial of Service Vulnerability

- Root cause: A logic error occurs when the affected software processes specific MP-BGP EVPN update messages.
- Vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software.
- Impact: An attacker could trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. A successful exploit could result in a crash of the l2vpn_mgr process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI). On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.
- Attack vector: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network. An attacker that controls multiple Customer Edge (CE) devices could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the EVPN network.
- Required attacker capabilities: An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker is required.
