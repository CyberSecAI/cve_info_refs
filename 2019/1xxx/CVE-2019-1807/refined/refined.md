Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1807:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the session management functionality of the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard's web UI.
- Specifically, the application does not invalidate an existing session when a user authenticates and changes their credentials through another active session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Session Invalidation:** The core issue is the lack of proper session invalidation upon credential changes. This allows an attacker to maintain access via the old session even after a user changes their password or other login credentials from a separate, legitimate session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker, who has gained access to the application through a valid user session, can maintain access to the dashboard even after the user changes their credentials from another active session.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information in the dashboard.
- **Integrity Violation:**  An attacker could modify or manipulate data within the dashboard.
- **Availability Impact:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the dashboard, causing service availability issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely via the network.
- **Web UI:** The vulnerability resides within the web UI of the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs initial access to the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard via a valid user session. This requires valid user credentials.
- **Separate Authenticated Session:** The attacker needs another active authenticated session. This could be on the attacker's system or a second compromised user system.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction because the attacker needs the original legitimate session to remain active.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L**
    - **AV:N (Network):** The attack vector is over the network.
    - **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low.
    - **PR:L (Low):** The attacker needs low privileges (existing user).
    - **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required for the attack to succeed.
    - **S:U (Unchanged):** The scope of the attack is unchanged (limited to the affected component).
    - **C:H (High):** Confidentiality impact is high.
    - **I:H (High):** Integrity impact is high.
    - **A:L (Low):** Availability impact is low.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects the cloud-based Cisco Umbrella Dashboard.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the issue, and no user action is needed as the fix was applied to the cloud.
- There are no workarounds.
