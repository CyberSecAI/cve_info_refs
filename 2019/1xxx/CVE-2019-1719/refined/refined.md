Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1719:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the web-based guest portal of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). This lack of proper input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Specifically, this is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is reflected back to the user's browser, potentially executing malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful attack enables the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the victim's browser session when using the web interface.
- **Sensitive Information Access:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive browser-based information, such as cookies, session tokens or other data related to the user's interaction with the web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through a network connection, as indicated by the CVSS vector string "AV:N".
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to persuade a user of the web interface to click a specially crafted link containing the malicious script to trigger the vulnerability, as indicated by "UI:R".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be remote and authenticated. While the advisory does not specify the level of authentication needed, the CVSS vector string "PR:N" implies that no privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- They need to be able to create a crafted link containing malicious script.
- They need to be able to entice a legitimate user of the web interface to click the link.

**Additional Notes:**
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than installing the security patch.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE).
- The CVSS base score is 6.1, rated as MEDIUM severity.
