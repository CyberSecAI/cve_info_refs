Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1817

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of HTTP and HTTPS requests within the web proxy functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Improper input validation of HTTP and HTTPS requests. This allows for malformed requests to be processed, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a restart of the web proxy process, resulting in a temporary denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This disrupts the web security services provided by the affected appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending a malformed HTTP or HTTPS request to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device, making it a remote attack vector.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected products are Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance, both virtual and hardware appliances.
- Successful exploitation could result in the WSA writing out a core file for the main proxy process. This can be used to confirm exploitation through analysis by Cisco TAC.
- There are no workarounds available. Cisco recommends upgrading to the fixed software versions.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 8.6, indicating a high severity. The vector string is CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
