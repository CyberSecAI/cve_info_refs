Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2019-1653:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper access control in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV320 and RV325 routers. Specifically, certain CGI programs like `/cgi-bin/config.exp` and `/cgi-bin/export_debug_msg.exp` could be accessed without prior authentication.
*   The vulnerability stems from inadequate fixes by the vendor, where initial patches were bypassed via modified HTTP requests or exploiting other vectors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure through the web interface. The router's configuration file, which contains sensitive data, can be retrieved without authentication.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability allowed unauthenticated access to sensitive data via HTTP/HTTPS requests to specific URLs.
*  **Inadequate Patching:** Initial attempts to fix the vulnerability were insufficient, with researchers discovering that simple modifications of the exploit allowed it to function even after the initial patches.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Attackers can retrieve the router's configuration file, which includes:
    *   Internal network configuration details
    *   VPN and IPsec secrets
    *   Password hashes for router user accounts.
*   **Device and Network Compromise:** With the exposed configuration data, attackers can:
    *   Gain access to the router's web interface by using the password hashes (cracking is not necessarily required)
    *   Potentially gain further access into attached networks
    *   Facilitate further attacks by leveraging internal network details
*  **Location Tracking:** The debug information also leaks the SSID, allowing attackers to track the physical location of the router using services like WiGLE.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Chained):** Although CVE-2019-1653 itself is an information disclosure vulnerability, it's often chained with CVE-2019-1652 (command injection) to achieve remote code execution. By first obtaining credentials through CVE-2019-1653, attackers can then use them to leverage CVE-2019-1652.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP/HTTPS Requests:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specific HTTP or HTTPS requests to the device's web interface. The vulnerable CGI programs are accessed directly through these requests.
*   **Modified HTTP Requests:** Bypassing initial fixes required modifying the user-agent of the HTTP request and using HTTP POST requests instead of GET requests for `config.exp`, as well as adjusting the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable router, either via the WAN or LAN interface if Remote Management is enabled.
*   **No Authentication Required (Initially):** Exploiting the initial vulnerability does not require prior authentication. However, some exploits chain this vulnerability with a command injection vulnerability that requires valid credentials once they have been obtained through the information disclosure vector.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Attackers require a basic understanding of how to send HTTP requests (e.g., using tools like `curl` or custom scripts).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by RedTeam Pentesting and publicly disclosed after a period of coordinated disclosure with Cisco.
*   Cisco released firmware updates to address the vulnerability, but initial fixes were incomplete, requiring multiple rounds of updates.
*   The vulnerability affects Cisco RV320 and RV325 routers with firmware versions 1.4.2.15 through 1.4.2.20. The complete fix is available in firmware version 1.4.2.22 and later.
*   The exploitation of this vulnerability has been observed in the wild with active scanning and attempts to compromise devices.

**In summary**, CVE-2019-1653 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve sensitive device information. This vulnerability, when chained with command injection vulnerabilities, can lead to full remote control of the device, impacting the confidentiality and integrity of the device and the network it is connected to.
