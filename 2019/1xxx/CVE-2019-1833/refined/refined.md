The vulnerability stems from the improper parsing of specific attributes within the TLS packet header by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol parser in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect TLS packet parsing leading to a policy bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the configured policies of the affected Cisco FTD system.
- Successful exploitation allows unauthorized traffic to pass through without inspection, potentially leading to further attacks or unauthorized access.
- The impact is a compromise of the security policy enforcement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker can send malicious TLS messages to the affected system.
- The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the targeted Cisco FTD device.
- No special privileges are required on the target system (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required for the attack (UI:N).

**Additional Details:**
- No workarounds are available to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing.
- Cisco has released software updates to remediate the vulnerability.
- There is no evidence of public exploitation or knowledge of this vulnerability being used maliciously.
- CVSS v3 score is 5.8 (Medium) with the vector string: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
