| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XE Software Web UI Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20190612-iosxe-csrf  First Published: 2019 June 12 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2019 July 16 15:51 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuy98103](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuy98103)     CVE-2019-1904     CWE-352       CVSS Score: [Base 8.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-1904     CWE-352       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190612-iosxe-csrf/csaf/cisco-sa-20190612-iosxe-csrf.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the web-based UI (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration, execute commands, or reload an affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software with the HTTP Server feature enabled. The default state of the HTTP Server feature is version dependent.  For information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determining the HTTP Server Configuration To determine whether the HTTP Server feature is enabled for a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the **show running-config | include ip http server|secure-server** command in the CLI to check for the presence of the **ip http server** command or the **ip http secure-server** command in the global configuration. If either command is present and configured, the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the device.  The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include ip http server|secure-server** command for a device that has the HTTP Server feature enabled:  ```   Router# show running-config | include ip http server|secure-server   ip http server   ip http secure-server   ```  The presence of either command in the device configuration indicates that the HTTP Server feature is enabled.  If the output from the previous command also contains:  ```   ip http active-session-modules none   ip http secure-active-session-modules none   ```  The device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory. Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release To determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the **show version** command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays *Cisco IOS Software*, *Cisco IOS XE Software*, or similar text.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of *CAT3K\_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M*:  ```   ios-xe-device# show version      Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Sun 27-Mar-16 21:47 by mcpre   .   .   .   ```  For information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see the [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Disabling the HTTP Server feature eliminates the attack vector for this vulnerability and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Administrators can disable the HTTP Server feature by using the **no ip http server** or **no ip http secure-server** command in global configuration mode. If both http server and http-secure server are in use, then both commands are required to disable the HTTP Server feature.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free [software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.          Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x), that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse   + Enter the output of the **show version** command for the tool to parse   + Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**-in the following field:       By default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the **Impact Rating** drop-down list.     For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release. **Note:** Starting with Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.9.1, any upgrade will require Smart Licensing. Customers who plan to upgrade Cisco IOS XE to Release 16.9.1 or later are advised to consider the Smart Licensing requirement.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.8 |
