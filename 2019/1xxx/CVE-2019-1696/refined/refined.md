Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect SMB ingress packet processing for specific SMB packet types within the SMB Protocol preprocessor detection engine of Cisco FTD Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of specific SMB packet types leads to a memory exhaustion condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the device to run low on system memory. This can lead to the device stopping forwarding traffic. A manual reload of the device may be required to recover.
- The vulnerability causes a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker sends a steady stream of crafted SMB packets to the targeted device from the local subnet.
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 are viable attack vectors.
- Both SMBv2 and SMBv3 network traffic can be used for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within the local subnet (adjacent) to the targeted device.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted SMB packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is not dependent on CVE-2019-1704; exploitation of one does not require the other to be exploited.
- A specific error log (`Firepower-module1 kernel: [1111040.969265] snort invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0xd0, order=0, oom_score_adj=0`) could indicate a possible exploit of this vulnerability.
- No workarounds are available and the vulnerability is rated as High severity.
- The affected products include various Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software running on Cisco appliances, as well as open-source Snort project.
