Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) incorrectly logging the admin password in clear text when a user is forced to change the default password upon their first login to the web portal. This logging action only occurs during this initial password change and does not apply to subsequent changes or other accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-532):** The primary weakness is the logging of the admin password in clear text. This violates fundamental security principles of storing sensitive data such as passwords in encrypted or hashed form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can view the admin password in clear text.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  With the exposed admin password, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the affected system, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Web Portal:** The specific attack vector is through the web portal interface of Cisco Enterprise NFVIS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs a valid user account to access the web portal. This indicates the attacker does not need to be an administrator, but has to be a legitimate user.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote network access to the vulnerable system.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to a Cisco NFVIS system by viewing the clear text admin password stored in the logs during the initial password change.

**Additional Notes**
The provided documents also show the CVSS score for this vulnerability which is 6.5 (Medium), and includes the vector string: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N`.
It also confirms that the vulnerability was found during internal security testing and that there are no known public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
Fixed software is available in Cisco Enterprise NFVIS releases 3.9.1 and later.
