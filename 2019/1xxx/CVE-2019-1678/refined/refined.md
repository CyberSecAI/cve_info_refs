- Network Access: The attacker requires network access to the Cisco Meeting Server.

**Additional Notes:**
- No workarounds are available to mitigate the vulnerability besides patching.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server.
- The CVSS score is 4.3 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
