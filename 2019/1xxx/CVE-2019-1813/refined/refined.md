Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1813:

**Vulnerability Overview:**
Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Image Signature Verification feature of Cisco NX-OS Software that could allow an attacker to install a malicious software image on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to improper verification of software digital signatures during CLI command execution.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the improper verification of software digital signatures when executing CLI commands related to software image installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper digital signature verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated, local attacker with administrator-level credentials can install an unsigned or malicious software image on the affected device.
- If the device is not patched for a previously disclosed vulnerability (cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif), a successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot the device with a malicious software image.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the device.
- CLI (Command Line Interface)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access to the device with administrator-level credentials.
- Ability to execute CLI commands.

**Affected Products (from the advisory):**
- Nexus 3000 Series Switches (Specific PIDs listed)
- Nexus 3600 Platform Switches
- Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode
- Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platform

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory states that a complete fix requires both a software update and a BIOS update. If the device was previously vulnerable to  cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif, the BIOS might not be up to date even if the software is updated.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- Cisco has released software updates to address these vulnerabilities.
