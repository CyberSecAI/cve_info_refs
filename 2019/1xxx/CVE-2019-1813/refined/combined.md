"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Image Signature Verification feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator-level credentials to install a malicious software image on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities exist because software digital signatures are not properly verified during CLI command execution. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to install an unsigned software image on an affected device.\r\n\r\nNote: If the device has not been patched for the vulnerability previously disclosed in the Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif\"], a successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-sisv2 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-sisv2\"]"

"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the applicable table in this section. In the following tables, the left column lists Cisco NX-OS Software releases.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.7 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.7 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.7 |

The vulnerabilities exist because software digital signatures are not properly verified during CLI command execution. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to install an unsigned software image on an affected device.  **Note:** If the device has not been patched for the vulnerability previously disclosed in the Cisco Security Advisory [cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif), a successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products These vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software:    + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platform **Note:** For the Nexus 3000 Series Switches, only a subset of products supports image signature verification. The following Nexus 3000 Series product IDs (PIDs) are affected by these vulnerabilities:    + N3K-C31108PC-V   + N3K-C31108TC-V   + N3K-C31128PQ-10GE   + N3K-C3132C-Z   + N3K-C3164Q-40GE   + N3K-C3232C   + N3K-C3264C-E   + N3K-C3264Q   + N3K-C34180YC   + N3K-C3432D-I   + N3K-C3464C For information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determining the Cisco NX-OS Product ID To check the PID, administrators can use the **show inventory** command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the PID **N3K-C3232C**:  ```   switch# show inventory         NAME: "Chassis",  DESCR: "Nexus3000 C3232C Chassis"                      PID: N3K-C3232C          ,  VID: V02 ,  SN: FOC20291JA0                  NAME: "Slot 1",  DESCR: "32x40/100G QSFP28 2x10G SFP+ Ethernet Module"        PID: N3K-C3232C          ,  VID: V02 ,  SN: FOC20291JA0                  NAME: "Power Supply 1",  DESCR: "Nexus3000 C3232C Chassis Power Supply"         PID: NXA-PAC-650W-PI     ,  VID: V01 ,  SN: LIT20362Z6G     ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the   vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and   expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they   have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or   otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the   terms of the Cisco software license:   <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they   have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco   authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance   upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security   software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license,   additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to   regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available   from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded   contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and   software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the   new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to   contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted   maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco   service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party   vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their   point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be   prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement   to a free upgrade. Fixed ReleasesCustomers are advised to [upgrade to an appropriate release](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) as indicated in the applicable table in this section. In the following tables, the left column lists Cisco NX-OS Software releases. The right column indicates the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. **Note:** A complete fix for these vulnerabilities requires that a proper BIOS version is installed. Customers who are running an affected product that is listed in the previously disclosed Cisco advisory [cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif) may not have upgraded the BIOS when the software was installed even if they are running a fixed software release.
