Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Secure Storage feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software.
- When handling configuration updates, the software may not perform a complete cleanup of the encryption buffer.
- This incomplete cleanup can lead to the storage of an unencrypted version of the configuration file alongside its encrypted counterpart.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Memory Operations:** The software fails to properly clear the memory buffer after encryption, leaving sensitive data exposed in unencrypted form.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability enables access to sensitive system information due to the presence of unencrypted configuration data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Keying Materials:** A successful exploit can expose keying materials within the device configuration.
- **Recovery of Critical System Information:** This leaked keying material can then be used to recover sensitive system information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
- **Memory Retrieval:** The attack vector involves retrieving the contents of specific memory locations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the device.
- **Local Privilege:** The attacker must have high privileges to access the necessary memory locations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software with the Secure Storage feature enabled.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this issue, and users are advised to consult the Cisco IOS Software Checker to determine if their software is affected and for updated versions.
- The CVSS score of 4.4 indicates a medium severity vulnerability with high confidentiality impact.
