Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of JPEG files within the Skia graphics library. Specifically, the decoder was treating the output of a JPEG as if it were a 16-bit per component RGB PNG, leading to a type confusion and incorrect processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type confusion:** The Skia library incorrectly assumes the format of the decoded JPEG data, leading to the wrong data interpretation.
- **Incorrect data handling:**  Due to the type confusion, the library processes the data incorrectly, potentially leading to memory corruption or other issues.
- **Integer Overflow:** A separate commit also addresses a heap buffer overflow vulnerability where the offset ends up the same as the width during sampling, leading to an incorrect write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  As per the Android Security Bulletin, successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This is the most severe potential impact.
- **Memory corruption:** Incorrect handling of image data can lead to memory corruption issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted JPEG file:** A remote attacker needs to craft a malicious JPEG file designed to trigger the vulnerability in the Skia library.
- **File processing:** This crafted file could then be delivered to a vulnerable Android device, potentially via web browsing, email, or other means that involve image processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, requiring only the ability to deliver the malicious JPEG file to a vulnerable device.
- **No specific privileges:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the target device to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Crafting knowledge:** The attacker needs the technical expertise to craft a JPEG that triggers the type confusion vulnerability.
