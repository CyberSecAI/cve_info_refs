  "cve": "CVE-2019-1380",
  "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the user-mode printer driver host process splwow64.exe. The code is subject to a time-of-check/time-of-use race condition when handling a call from a client. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges from low integrity and execute code in the context of the current user at medium integrity.",
