Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1604

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect authorization check within the user account management interface of Cisco NX-OS Software. Specifically, the system doesn't properly validate user accounts and their associated Group IDs (GIDs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Authorization Check (CWE-863):** The core issue is the flawed authorization mechanism that allows users to potentially execute commands with higher privileges than they should have. This is due to a logic error in how the system handles user accounts and their GIDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local, authenticated attacker to gain elevated privileges on the affected device.
- **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges:** The attacker can execute commands with root-level or administrative access on the underlying Linux shell of the device. This allows full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be a user with valid authentication credentials on the device

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an existing, authenticated user account on a vulnerable Cisco NX-OS device.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the device's command-line interface (CLI).
- User Interaction is Required as the attacker would need to manually use the higher privileged commands they are not supposed to access.

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-1604 is a privilege escalation vulnerability affecting Cisco NX-OS software. It arises from an improper authorization check related to user accounts and GIDs, allowing an authenticated local attacker to execute commands with elevated privileges. Successful exploitation leads to the attacker gaining root-level control of the device.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing at Cisco.
- There are no known workarounds, and users are advised to apply the software updates provided by Cisco to fix the issue.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Nexus series switches running NX-OS software in standalone mode.

**CVSS Score:**
- Base Score: 7.3 (High)
- Vector String: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
