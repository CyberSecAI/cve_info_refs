- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-119, which generally relates to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, including the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends a user a malicious ARF or WRF file via a link or email attachment.
- The user must be persuaded to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software.
- The attack vector is local, meaning the malicious file must be executed on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create or obtain a specially crafted ARF or WRF file.
- The attacker needs to deliver this malicious file to a user of the vulnerable software and convince them to open the file.
- No special privileges are required on the target system itself to trigger the vulnerability. The user opening the file provides the required privileges.
