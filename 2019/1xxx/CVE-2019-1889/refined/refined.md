Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from incomplete validation and error checking of the file path during software uploads via the REST API in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate input validation: The system fails to properly validate the file path provided during software uploads. This allows for potentially malicious paths to be specified.
- Insufficient error checking:  The system lacks proper error handling when processing the uploaded software, which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to escalate their privileges to *root* on the affected device. This grants the attacker complete control over the system.
- Malicious software deployment: By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could upload and execute malicious software on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- REST API: The attack is carried out by uploading malicious software through the Cisco APIC REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication: The attacker must be authenticated with the *administrator* role on the device before exploiting this vulnerability.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the affected Cisco APIC device to utilize the REST API.

**Summary:** This is a privilege escalation vulnerability that arises due to improper handling of file paths during software uploads via the REST API. A remote authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can exploit this flaw to gain root access on the vulnerable system by uploading malicious software.
