Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient security requirements during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The vulnerability exists because of a lack of sufficient security checks during the LLDP setup when connecting to the infrastructure VLAN.
- The default "permissive mode" setting for fabric secure mode on the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI switches is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can bypass security validations.
- An attacker can connect an unauthorized server to the highly privileged infrastructure VLAN.
- With access to the infrastructure VLAN, an attacker can:
  - Make unauthorized connections to Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) services.
  - Join other host endpoints within the infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends a malicious LLDP packet on the adjacent subnet to the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switch in ACI mode.
- This requires the attacker to be on the same Layer 2 network segment as the targeted switch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be adjacent to the vulnerable Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switch (same Layer 2 network segment).
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.
- The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted LLDP packet.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode running software versions prior to 14.1(2g) when using the default permissive mode setting for fabric secure mode.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by enabling strict mode, which enforces additional security checks.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.4 (High).
