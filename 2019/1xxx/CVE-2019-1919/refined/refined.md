Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1919:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of a static account with known credentials within the underlying Linux operating system of Cisco FindIT Network Management Software virtual machine (VM) images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Static Credentials:** The use of a hardcoded username and password combination creates an easily exploitable weakness.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The presence of the static account with root privileges in the default VM image is a security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root-Level Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain *root*-level privileges on the affected VM.
*   **Full System Control:** With root access, the attacker can fully compromise the affected system and potentially pivot to other systems in the network.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact**: The attacker can potentially access, modify, and disable any resources on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the VM console. This means physical or virtual access to the VM running the affected Cisco software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access to VM Console:** The attacker must be able to access the command line interface of the vulnerable VM. This could be via a virtual machine hypervisor console or physical access to the underlying server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or knowledge of credentials to exploit the vulnerability besides the static credentials.

**Additional Notes**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects only Cisco FindIT Network Manager and Cisco FindIT Network Probe Release 1.1.4 when using Cisco-supplied VM images.
*   **Workaround:** Disabling the root account using the command `sudo passwd -dl root` at a shell prompt is provided as a workaround.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. Upgrading to version 2.0 is recommended for affected versions.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 8.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
