Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-1881:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the web-based management interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform arbitrary actions on an affected device by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. This leverages the user's web browser and their privileges within the application.
- The impact is related to integrity, allowing the attacker to modify settings or data through actions performed with the user's privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is network-based (AV:N).
- It requires low attack complexity (AC:L).
- No privileges are required (PR:N) by the attacker.
- User interaction is required (UI:R), the user must click a malicious link or take another action to initiate the exploit.
- The scope is changed (S:C) meaning the vulnerability allows the attacker to affect resources beyond what the user can typically control.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted link or web page to a legitimate user of the Cisco IND web-based management interface.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to launch the CSRF attack.
- The attack is launched remotely over the network.
