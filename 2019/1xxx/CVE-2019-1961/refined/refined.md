Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the improper input validation of tar packages uploaded through the Web Portal to the Image Repository in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate the contents of uploaded tar packages, allowing a malicious actor to craft a specially designed tar file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system (OS) of the affected device.
*   The confidentiality of the system is compromised as an attacker can access sensitive information by reading files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely through the Web Portal.
*   **Uploaded Crafted TAR Package:** An attacker uploads a malicious tar package to the Image Repository through the Web Portal.
*   **Log Analysis:** The attacker views log entries generated after uploading the malicious package, potentially exposing the contents of files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the Web Portal and upload files.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must have remote network access to the affected system to reach the Web Portal.

**Summary of Findings**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation when handling tar packages uploaded via the web portal, which an attacker can leverage after authenticating to read arbitrary files from the underlying OS by examining log entries generated during the upload.
