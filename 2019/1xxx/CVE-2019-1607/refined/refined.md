Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1607:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of arguments passed to specific CLI commands within Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands within the arguments of vulnerable CLI commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
*   **Elevated Privileges:** These arbitrary commands are executed with elevated privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected device's CLI.
*   **CLI Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the device's command-line interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:**  The attacker needs valid administrator credentials to access the CLI and execute the malicious commands.
*   **Local CLI Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device and be able to interact with the CLI.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches
*   Cisco Nexus 7700 Series Switches

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary mitigation is to upgrade to a fixed version of Cisco NX-OS software. There are no workarounds to prevent exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory is part of a bundled publication of security advisories for Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software.
* The advisory mentions that several similar CLI command injection vulnerabilities exist, differing primarily in affected products and software versions.
* The provided CVSS score is 4.2 (Medium) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
* The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
