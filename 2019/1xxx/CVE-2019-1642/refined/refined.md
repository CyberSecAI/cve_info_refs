Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1642

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow the attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.
    - Access sensitive, browser-based information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Attackers persuade a user of the affected interface to click a crafted link containing the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to persuade a user to click the crafted link.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**
- **Affected versions:** Cisco Firepower Management Center versions 6.2.2.2 & 6.2.3.
- **Proof of concept:** The exploit demonstrates the XSS by appending a malicious script to the URL within the FMC's Time Setting configuration page:
`https://<ip address>/platinum/platformSettingEdit.cgi?type=>"><script>alert("XXS POC")</script>&`
- **Solution:** Upgrade to version 6.3.0 or a later version where the fix for the vulnerability is implemented.
