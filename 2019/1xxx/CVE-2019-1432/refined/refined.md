Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-1432:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing font files in the DirectWrite library within Microsoft Windows. This inadequate validation allows for a read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read due to the lack of proper input validation. Specifically, the DirectWrite library does not properly check the size or boundaries of the data it is processing when handling font files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the system's memory due to the out-of-bounds read. The attacker could use this leaked information to further compromise the system.
- Code Execution: While the vulnerability itself is an information disclosure, the advisory mentions that it can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution within the current process's context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Font Files: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing maliciously crafted font files.
- Malicious Pages:  Attackers can deliver these malicious font files through a malicious website.
- Malicious Files: Attackers can also deliver these files through other means, such as email attachments or other file transfer methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User interaction: The target user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage containing the malicious font file.
- No privilege required: The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
