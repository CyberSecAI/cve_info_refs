Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient validation of arguments passed to certain CLI commands in Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-88):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system due to a lack of proper input sanitization in CLI commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device with elevated privileges.
*   **Compromise of Device:**  An attacker can potentially gain full control of the device through the arbitrary command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected device.
*   **CLI:** The attack is performed through the command-line interface of the Cisco NX-OS software.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by including malicious input as arguments to vulnerable CLI commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs valid administrator credentials on the affected device to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the device's CLI.

**Additional Notes:**

*   No workarounds are available, requiring a software update to fix the issue.
*   This vulnerability is part of a bundle of similar CLI command injection vulnerabilities, primarily differing in affected products and software versions.
