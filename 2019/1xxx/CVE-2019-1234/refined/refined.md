  "CVE-2019-1234": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation on the host when loading a template from a remote URL within Azure Stack's User Portal, which results in a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The User Portal sends an HTTP GET request to the provided URL without proper checks, allowing access to internal services.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
        "Lack of authentication on internal API endpoints"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit the SSRF vulnerability to access internal Azure Stack services, such as the DataService, which does not require authentication. This allows the attacker to gather screenshots and other sensitive information about tenant and infrastructure virtual machines.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious template URL that points to the internal DataService API.",
        "The attacker then uses the Azure Stack User Portal to load the template, which triggers the SSRF vulnerability."
       ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the Azure Stack User Portal and the ability to load a template from a remote URL. They must also know or be able to discover internal API endpoints."
