**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex HX-Series.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The web interface lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to potentially perform unintended actions.

- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade a legitimate user of the web-based management interface to follow a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link that exploits the CSRF vulnerability.
