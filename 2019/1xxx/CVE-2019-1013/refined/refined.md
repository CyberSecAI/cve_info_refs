## Analysis of CVE-2019-1013

The provided content from Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) describes two distinct vulnerabilities, both identified as CVE-2019-1013, affecting Microsoft Windows gdiplus library during font file parsing.

**Vulnerability 1 (ZDI-19-580): Out-Of-Bounds Read**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during font file parsing in the gdiplus library.
*   **Vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data within font files, potentially leading to a read operation beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** User interaction is required. The target must open a malicious font file or visit a malicious webpage that triggers the parsing of a malicious font.
*   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious font file to the victim.
*   **Affected Component:** gdiplus library

**Vulnerability 2 (ZDI-19-573): Uninitialized Pointer**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it during font file parsing in the gdiplus library.
*   **Vulnerability:** The issue stems from the gdiplus library's failure to properly initialize memory before accessing it. This can lead to the use of an uninitialized pointer.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** User interaction is required. The target must open a malicious font file or visit a malicious webpage that triggers the parsing of a malicious font.
*   **Attacker Capability:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious font file to the victim.
*   **Affected Component:** gdiplus library

Both vulnerabilities have a CVSS score of 3.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N). Both advisories mention that Microsoft has released an update to address the vulnerability. They also mention that exploitation could be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.
