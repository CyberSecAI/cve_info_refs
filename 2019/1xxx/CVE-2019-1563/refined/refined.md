  "CVE-2019-1563": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2019-1563",
      "Description": "In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, using a Bleichenbacher padding oracle attack. Applications are not affected if they use a certificate together with the private RSA key to the CMS_decrypt or PKCS7_decrypt functions to select the correct recipient info to decrypt.",
        "Other_Information": "Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s)."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain decryption functions, specifically within `PKCS7_dataDecode` and `CMS_decrypt_set1_pkey`, leading to a Bleichenbacher padding oracle vulnerability.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Padding Oracle",
        "Incorrect handling of decryption functions"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can potentially recover a CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted message that was encrypted with the public RSA key, by sending a large number of messages to be decrypted. This could allow an attacker to decrypt encrypted communications.",
       "Attack Vectors": [
        "Network",
        "Timing Side-Channel"
       ],
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send a large number of messages to be decrypted and receive automated notifications of successful or failed decryption attempts. The attacker can be remote and doesn't need to be on a local machine.",
      "Affected Versions": [
        "OpenSSL 1.1.1-1.1.1c",
        "OpenSSL 1.1.0-1.1.0k",
        "OpenSSL 1.0.2-1.0.2s"
      ]
    }
