## CVE-2019-1759

This content is related to CVE-2019-1759.

### Root Cause
The vulnerability is due to a logic error introduced in Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.1.1, which prevents the ACL from working when applied against the management interface (Gigabit Ethernet Management interface).

### Weakness
The ACL applied to the Gigabit Ethernet Management interface is not evaluated, leading to an ACL bypass.

### Impact
An unauthenticated, remote attacker can reach the configured IP addresses on the Gigabit Ethernet Management interface, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the device.

### Attack Vector
A remote attacker attempts to access the device via the management interface.

### Required Attacker Capabilities
The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device's management interface. They do not need any authentication credentials.
