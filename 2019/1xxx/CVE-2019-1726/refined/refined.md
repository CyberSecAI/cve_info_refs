Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command in Cisco NX-OS Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper Input Validation: The system fails to properly validate user-supplied arguments to a CLI command.
- CLI Bypass: By exploiting the insufficient input validation, an attacker can bypass intended restrictions and access internal services.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Access to Restricted Services: A successful exploit allows an attacker to access internal services, such as the NX-API, that should be restricted.
- Potential for Further Compromise: Access to these internal services could potentially lead to further compromise or unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the affected device.
- CLI Interaction: Exploitation occurs through a malicious crafted argument within a specific CLI command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid Device Credentials: The attacker must have valid device credentials to log in and execute the vulnerable command.
- Local Access: The attacker must have a local presence on the device.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Products: The advisory lists a range of Cisco products running vulnerable versions of NX-OS software, including MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches, various Nexus switches, and UCS Fabric Interconnects.
- No Workarounds:  There are no workarounds to mitigate this issue other than upgrading to the fixed software releases.
- Fixed Software: Cisco has released software updates for affected products.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-78 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command).
- The CVSS base score is 5.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L.
