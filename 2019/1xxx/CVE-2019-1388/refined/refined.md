Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-1388:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the User Account Control (UAC) user interface displayed on the secure desktop in Microsoft Windows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The UAC interface, when interacted with maliciously, allows launching a highly-privileged web browser on the normal desktop.
- This interaction bypasses security restrictions and allows for privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to the SYSTEM level.
- This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have access to an interactive desktop on the target system as a low-privileged user.
- Exploitation involves malicious interaction with the UAC user interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have initial access to an interactive desktop with low privileges on the targeted Windows system.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the UAC interface to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2019-07-23 and publicly disclosed on 2019-11-13.
- Microsoft has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Eduardo Braun Prado.

The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, specifically about the mechanism of exploitation involving interaction with the UAC interface and the resultant launch of a highly-privileged browser.
