Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-1859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to a flaw in how OpenSSH handles the authentication process on Cisco Small Business switches. Specifically, it mishandles the logic when client-side certificate authentication is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSH Certificate Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass client-side certificate authentication.
- **Fallback to Password Authentication:** When certificate authentication fails due to the OpenSSH mishandling, the system incorrectly reverts to password authentication. This allows attackers to attempt logins with passwords, even when certificate auth is preferred.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** If the attacker successfully bypasses certificate authentication and guesses a valid password (or if default credentials are still in use), they can gain administrative access to the vulnerable device. This allows them to access and modify the configuration of the switch.
- **Complete Control:** Administrative access could potentially lead to a full compromise of the device's security.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network. An attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device to send SSH connection attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the targeted switch.
- **SSH Access:** The attacker must initiate an SSH connection to the vulnerable device.
- **Privileges:** While not required initially, the attacker will attempt to gain privileged administrative access.
- **Password knowledge (if default credentials are changed):** If certificate authentication is enabled, but default password are changed, the attacker will need to attempt to use password guessing techniques

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Small Business 200, 250, 300, 350, 350X, and 550X series switches are affected by this vulnerability with specific software releases.
- **No Workarounds:** Cisco has stated that there are no workarounds to fully mitigate the vulnerability. Disabling client-side certificate auth and using password-based auth is a mitigation strategy.
- **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
- **Reported by:** Katie Sexton and Jimi Sebree of Tenable Research.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 7.2, which is considered High.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability falls under CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation.
