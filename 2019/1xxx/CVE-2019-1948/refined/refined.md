Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-1948

**Root Cause:** Insufficient SSL certificate validation in Cisco Webex Meetings Mobile (iOS) application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The application does not properly validate SSL certificates. This allows an attacker to present a crafted, invalid certificate that the application will incorrectly accept.
*   CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*   The attacker can decrypt confidential information exchanged between the user's device and the Webex server. This means the attacker gains unauthorized read access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is remote, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the device.
*   The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the user's device and the server to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   The attacker needs the capability to create and supply a crafted SSL certificate.
*   No authentication is required, so any attacker in a network position to intercept the traffic can attempt the attack.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco Webex Meetings Mobile (iOS) releases 11.3 to 39.5 if they were running on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.

**Fixed Software:**
*   Cisco Webex Meetings Mobile (iOS) releases 39.6 and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
