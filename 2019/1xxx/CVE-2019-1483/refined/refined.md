  "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the AppX Deployment Service. By creating a hard link, an attacker can abuse the service to overwrite the contents of a chosen file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the AppX Deployment Service, which can be abused by creating a hard link to overwrite the contents of a chosen file.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "The AppX Deployment Service improperly handles hard links, leading to arbitrary file overwrite."
  ],
  "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Local attackers who already have the ability to execute low-privileged code can exploit the vulnerability by creating a hard link to a chosen file and causing the AppX Deployment Service to overwrite its content."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "Ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
