## Description

[![@GoogleCodeExporter](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9614759?u=cc9d321ce8a017c405d02d97701bd06d77b5b30c&v=4&size=48)](/GoogleCodeExporter)[GoogleCodeExporter](https://github.com/GoogleCodeExporter)opened [on Mar 14, 2015](https://github.com/jianlinwei/cool-php-captcha/issues/2#issue-61400276)
```
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. http://127.0.0.1/example-form.php?captcha=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
filtered with htmlspcialchars()

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
0.2.1

Please provide any additional information below.
textbook xss.

Overall I think your captcha is quite secure and easy to implement. I like
the text manipluation and the random fonts. I recommend using randomly
generated answers over a list of words because possible guesses can be
compared to the list before making a real guess.
