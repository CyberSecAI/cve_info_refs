  "Root cause of vulnerability": "TurboGears2 ships with a quickstart configuration that uses a default value for the cookie salt in repoze.who for user authorization/authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Using a default cookie salt makes it possible for an attacker to craft a cookie that bypasses normal authentication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the site without going through the normal authentication process.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a cookie using the default cookie salt.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know the default cookie salt value."
