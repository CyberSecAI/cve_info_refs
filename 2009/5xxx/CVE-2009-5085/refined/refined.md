Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in APAR IZ44555, which is likely related to the specified CVE (though not directly mentioned):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the OpenID Trusted Sites Manager in IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager does not properly delete site information cookies. Specifically, when a user removes trust for a relying party site and then revisits that site, the consent-to-authenticate page is not displayed as it should. This indicates that the system still remembers the user's previous trust decision, likely due to an improperly cleared cookie or related data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Inadequate cookie/trust data management: The system fails to completely invalidate stored trust information after a user explicitly revokes trust for a site.
- Bypass of consent mechanism: The consent-to-authenticate mechanism is bypassed, potentially leading to unintended authentication and access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Unintended Access: If an attacker can access a user's browser or trick a user into visiting a previously trusted site after the user has revoked that trust, the user will be automatically logged in, potentially exposing their data.
- Loss of Control: Users lose control over which sites they have granted trust, making it difficult to prevent future unauthorized accesses.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves a user removing a trust relationship with an OpenID relying party site, then revisiting that site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need any specific capabilities besides tricking a user to revisit a site after trust revocation. The attacker does not need access to the system or the user's device if the user revisits the site directly, or if the site initiates a login process (e.g. through an embedded iframe).
- The attacker is assumed to be someone that could use the user's account through a vulnerability in the OpenID trust mechanism, such as through a malicious relying party site.

**Additional Notes**

- The APAR (IZ44555) indicates a problem with the OpenID identity provider functionality.
- The fix for this issue is included in multiple fix packs for Tivoli Federated Identity Manager 6.2.0
- The description of the vulnerability suggests it could be related to a cookie management issue.

While the provided content does not explicitly mention CVE-2009-5085, it describes a vulnerability that could potentially be the subject of the CVE, given the timeframe and product involved. The root cause and impact are consistent with common web authentication issues.
