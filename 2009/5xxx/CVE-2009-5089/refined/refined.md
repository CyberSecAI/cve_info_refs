Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-5089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of Local File Inclusion (LFI) and SQL Injection flaws in the ideacart 0.02 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files through the `page` parameter in `index.php` by manipulating the path.
*  **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cID` parameter in `/secure/index.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, potentially leading to information disclosure.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or complete compromise of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a manipulated `page` parameter.
*   **SQL Injection:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `/secure/index.php` with a manipulated `cID` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**

*   **LFI:** The exploit uses path traversal and null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass input validation mechanisms.
*   **SQL Injection:** The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` query to extract the database version, which can be customized to extract other sensitive data.
