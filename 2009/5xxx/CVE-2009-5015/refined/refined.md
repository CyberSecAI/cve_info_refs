{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default configuration of TurboGears2 ships with a default cookie salt for the authorization cookie in repoze.who.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure default configuration. The default cookie secret for authentication is known, allowing attackers to craft valid authentication cookies.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker knowing the default cookie secret can create a crafted cookie to gain unauthorized access to the site, bypassing normal authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafting a malicious cookie with the known default secret.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Knowledge of the default cookie secret and ability to create a cookie with the crafted value."
