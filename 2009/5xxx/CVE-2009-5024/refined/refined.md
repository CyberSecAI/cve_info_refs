Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-5024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `cvsdb.py` file in ViewVC versions prior to 1.1.11 did not properly enforce the administrator-defined `row_limit` configuration setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Consumption:** The vulnerability lies in the failure to enforce the limit on the number of rows returned by a database query. This allows a user to bypass the intended restrictions on query size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a request with a large `limit` parameter, a remote attacker could force the ViewVC server to process an extremely large request. This could exhaust CPU and RAM resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the web interface of ViewVC.
*   **Maliciously crafted URL parameter:** The attack involves manipulating the `limit` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special access:** An attacker does not need any special credentials or prior access to exploit this vulnerability; it can be triggered through the standard web interface exposed by ViewVC.

**Additional Information:**

* The fix for this issue was included in ViewVC version 1.1.11.
