## Error description

* ```
  Note this defect only affects users of username/password
  managed information card identity provider configurations.

  When tracing is turned on for the class
  com.tivoli.am.fim.infocard.delegates.InfoCardSTSDelegate
  and someone presents a username/password information card
  at the IDP to exchange for a SAML assertion, the user's
  password is logged in trace.

  To recreat:

  Set up and InforCard IDP federation and turn on the
  trace string:
  com.tivoli.am.fim.infocard.delegates.InfoCardSTSDelegate=all

  Then authenticate to a relying-party with a
  username/password managed card and check trace.

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  Don't turn on trace for that class, or be very aware that
  passwords may appear in trace text and don't send them
  unaltered to anyone.

  ```
