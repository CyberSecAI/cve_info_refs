Looking into groff's NEWS file, pdfroff was added in version 1.19.2, so
that may be used as "first affected" in CVE description:

Subject: CVE id request: groff (pdfroff)

Hi,
We got two bug reports in our BTS for groff with security
impact which need CVE ids.

First one:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538330>
pdfroff tool of groff is creating files in a insecure manner
in the /tmp directory.

Second:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538338>
pdfroff tool of groff is calling ghostscript with the
-dSAFER command line option. From the manpage:

       -dSAFER
              Disables  the  "deletefile"  and  "renamefile" operators and the
              ability to open files in any mode other  than  read-only.   This
              strongly  recommended  for spoolers, conversion scripts or other
              sensitive  environments  where  a  badly  written  or  malicious
              PostScript  program  code must be prevented from changing impor-
              tant files.

This allows an attacker to delete or rename arbitrary victim owned files.

Can you allocate CVE ids for that?

Cheers
Nico

```
```
Package: groff
Version: 1.20.1-4
Severity: grave
File: /usr/bin/pdfroff
Tags: security

pdfroff invokes gs without -dSAFER, leading to the ability to write,
rename, and delete arbitrary files:

  lakeview ok % cat attack.roff
  I am an evil attacking document.  Boo!
  \X'ps: exec (/tmp/remove-me) deletefile'
  lakeview ok % touch /tmp/remove-me && pdfroff attack.roff >/dev/null && [ ! -f "/tmp/remove-me" ] && echo removed
  GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.64: Unrecoverable error, exit code 1
  removed

Using ps2pdf may be a better solution, since it uses -dSAFER
automatically.

Obviously, this is a fairly straightforward example, but in a document
the size of groff's -me manual, this could easily be hidden.  Disguising
it is easy, such as in:

  lakeview ok % cat attack.roff
  I am an evil attacking document.  Boo!
  .ds df deletefile
  .ds fn /tmp/remove-me
  \X'ps: exec (\*(fn) \*(df'

Processing or viewing a document from an unknown source shouldn't by
default cause code from that document to be executed, in general.

groff uses -dSAFER elsewhere (pre-html.cpp); is there any reason not to
do so here?
