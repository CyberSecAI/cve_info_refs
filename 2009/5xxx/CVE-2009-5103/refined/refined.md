  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-5103",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the bpe_nid parameter in default.asp is vulnerable.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize the email variable, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries to gain access to sensitive data, potentially including usernames and passwords. An attacker can also execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies or performing other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vectors are through HTTP GET requests to the default.asp page with malicious parameters. The SQL injection is triggered via the `bpe_nid` parameter and XSS is triggered via email variable. ",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges or access is required.",
    }
