Package: burn
Version: 0.4.4-1
Severity: normal
Tags: security

Hey there,

I just discovered that burn has trouble with quotation marks in file
names, and on a closer inspection it seems as if this actually has
security implications. I attached a tiny patch that fixes three of the
quotation problems, but there seem to be more issues like this in the
code, and I don't have the time right now to look closely at all of
them.

For a demonstration of the problem, create a valid ogg file and name
it

  " | date #".ogg

Then run burn -A -a *.ogg, and burn will happily print the current
date.

Thanks for the bug report; you're right that this is a security issue.

The correct fix for this will be to avoid string concatenation for
constructing command lines, and instead to use the ‘subprocess.Popen’
class for invoking subprocesses.

Are the quote characters meant to be part of the filename? I assume
not, but I'm currently unable to reproduce this behaviour.

> date.

Here is the series of steps I'm following:

* Start with a known Ogg Vorbis file (in my case, ‘postgresql.ogg’).

* Copy the file to a problematic filename::

    $ cp postgresql.ogg " | date #".ogg
    $ ls -1 *.ogg
     | date #.ogg
    postgresql.ogg

* Run ‘burn’ (with no disc in the drive)::

    $ burn -A -a *.ogg

At what point in the procedure do you see the date get printed?

Does the program continue with the rest of the normal procedure,
recording an audio disc?

Is it necessary to actually consume a blank disc to see this reported
behaviour?

Yes, the quotes are part of the filename and crucial to the exploit.

So just use the following as your first step:

$ cp postgresql.ogg '" | date #".ogg'

No need to waste a disk for this, the date gets printed while
preparing the image.

This is indeed a security issue, but not important enough to warrant
a DSA. However, we encourage maintainers to fix such minor security
issues through a point update. To do so, please prepare an updated
package for stable and send a debdiff to debian-release@lists.debian.org
for review.

Thanks,
        Moritz

Thanks. For the record, here are the steps I use to successfully
reproduce this bug:

* Start with a known Ogg Vorbis file (in my case, ‘postgresql.ogg’).

* Copy the file to a problematic filename::

    $ mv postgresql.ogg '" | date #".ogg'
    $ ls -1 *.ogg
    " | date #".ogg

* Run ‘burn’ (with no disc in the drive)::

    $ sudo burn -A -a ~/*.ogg

I have taken on the upstream maintainer role for this package, and am
currently testing a fix for this bug in a new version.

Back-porting the fix will not be impossible, but will be very tedious
because of many refactoring changes in the meantime. I guess, for
exacely the same reason, it's not acceptable to submit a package of
the new upstream version?

retitle 542750 burn: should use ‘subprocess’ module for secure child process interaction

Acting as upstream developer for the program, I have prepared a new
version that (among other changes) uses the ‘subprocess’ module, and
its sanitised argument handling, for all child process interactions.

This could have unforeseen effects. Could you please test the upstream
0.4.5 version from <URL:<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/burn/0.4.5>> and
make sure it works for all your use cases?

Ok, I just test with a couple of file collections that I burned
recently, among them one with quotation marks in filenames that caused
me to report the problem in the first place. Everything seems fine,
thank you!

By the way, is the README file in that tar.gz empty intentionally?

Great. Was this tested all the way through to burning discs? I would
very much appreciate that, if you have one you are willing to record.

> By the way, is the README file in that tar.gz empty intentionally?

Whoops, no it's not intentional. (Amusingly enough, it was caused by a
mis-use of ‘subprocess’ :-)

I've fixed the generation of that file, and uploaded version 0.4.5
again: <URL:<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/burn/0.4.5>>. Please download
and test that if you have the chance.
