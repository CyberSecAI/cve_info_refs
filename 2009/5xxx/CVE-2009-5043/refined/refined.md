  "cveId": "CVE-2009-5043",
  "description": "burn allows file names to escape via mishandled quotation marks",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The `burn` application mishandles quotation marks in filenames when constructing command lines for subprocesses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of filenames with special characters, specifically quotation marks",
       "Use of string concatenation for constructing command lines",
      "Lack of proper sanitization of command arguments before passing them to shell",
      "Vulnerable to command injection via filenames."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution. An attacker can craft a filename containing shell metacharacters, which `burn` will then execute as part of a command line, leading to code execution with the privileges of the user running `burn`.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious filename with shell metacharacters (e.g., `\" | command #\".ogg`)"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Ability to create files with arbitrary names on the filesystem"
    ],
    "requiredPosition": "Local user"

       "Ubuntu 8.04 LTS hardy",
       "Ubuntu 10.04 LTS lucid",

        "Ubuntu 11.04 natty",
        "Ubuntu 11.10 oneiric"
      ]
    }
  ],
   "additionalNotes": [
    "The vulnerability is triggered when `burn` processes audio files. For instance, when adding files for burning to an audio CD. The vulnerability can be triggered by simply preparing a file with the malicious filename, it's not necessary to burn a CD to trigger the exploit.",
       "The fix involves using the Python `subprocess` module to avoid shell expansion of arguments, ensuring safe invocation of child processes.",
       "The vulnerability was initially reported in Debian bug #542329."
