Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the issue #100 for pyftpdlib:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how `pyftpdlib` handles rapid connection attempts, specifically when the server is "bashed" with a large number of connections in a short time. This rapid connection/disconnection can lead to a race condition where the server attempts to get the peer name from a socket that is no longer connected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Race Condition:** The server's asynchronous event handling using `asyncore` appears vulnerable to race conditions. When a client connection is closed abruptly, the `asyncore` handler might still attempt to access the socket for operations like getting the peer name (`getpeername()`) which can cause the socket to be in an invalid state.
-   **Error Handling:** The server's error handling is insufficient to gracefully manage the `socket.error: (107, 'Transport endpoint is not connected')`. Instead, this error crashes the server, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the FTP server to crash by rapidly establishing and closing connections, making the service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
-   **Rapid Connection Attempts:** The attacker sends a high volume of connection requests to the FTP server and disconnects immediately, or before the connection is fully established. Tools like `nmap` can be used to achieve this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the FTP server.
-   **Ability to Generate Connections:** The attacker must be capable of sending a rapid series of connection attempts to the target server.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The attack does not require authentication or access to any privileged information.

**Additional Information:**

-   The provided traceback indicates the exception occurs within the `asyncore.py` module, specifically the `handle_accept` function of `pyftpdlib/ftpserver.py` which calls `getpeername` on a socket that is not connected.
-   The issue was reported for pyftpdlib version 0.5.1 running on Python 2.5.4.
-   The issue is marked as "Security" and "Priority-High" indicating its significance.
-   The user reporting the issue suggested a "robustly serve" option for the server indicating that the server was not robust.
-  The issue is marked as "imported from old googlecode site and very likely outdated".
