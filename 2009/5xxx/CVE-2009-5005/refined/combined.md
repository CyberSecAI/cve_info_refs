| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=642377#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-10-12 18:02:37 UTC  ``` It was reported [1], [2] that Apache QPID would crash due to a NULL pointer dereference when a remote, authenticated user attempted to redeclare an existing exchange and add a new alternate exchange.  This would result in a denial of service condition of the server.  This was corrected upstream by r811188 [3].

RHSA-2010:0773 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2010:0773 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging and Grid Version 1.3

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

Updated packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
multiple enhancements are now available as part of the ongoing support and
maintenance of Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging and Grid for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a realtime IT
infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG Messaging uses Apache Qpid to
implement the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) standard, adding
persistence options, kernel optimizations, and operating system services.

This update moves Red Hat Enterprise MRG to version 1.3.

A flaw was found in the way Apache Qpid handled the receipt of invalid AMQP
data. A remote user could send invalid AMQP data to the server, causing it
to crash, resulting in the cluster shutting down. (CVE-2009-5005)

A flaw was found in the way Apache Qpid handled a request to redeclare an
existing exchange while adding a new alternate exchange. If a remote,
authenticated user issued such a request, the server would crash, resulting
in the cluster shutting down. (CVE-2009-5006)

This update also adds the following enhancements:

* This update introduces a protocol-independent C++ API. The extra layer of

indirection will make it easy to support new versions of the AMQP protocol,
as well as multiple versions simultaneously. (BZ#497747)

* The management component is now capable of working in a cluster.

(BZ#501015)

* The Messaging Client Python API is now protocol-independent. (BZ#497748)
* This update allows a JMS client to subscribe to the failover exchange to

retrieve cluster membership information and subsequently to receive
updates. (BZ#483753)

* With this update, the qpidd service can be run without additional

authentication options. (BZ#515513)

* This update adds an OpenMPI wrapper script to Condor. It adds support for

OpenMPI jobs. (BZ#537232)

* The Messaging Client Python API now provides a failover mechanism for

clustered brokers. (BZ#495718)

* The Python Messaging API now includes support for Simple Authentication

and Security Layer (SASL), which allows authentication support to be added
to connection-based protocols. (BZ#548493)

* The qpid-tool is now able to determine which session a queue consumer

belongs to. (BZ#504325)

* This update handles backward/forward compatibility for QMF and its

components. (BZ#506698)

* Both Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)

entries can now appear in the list of known URLs. (BZ#471632)

* This update allows for the scheduler daemon to run without swap.

(BZ#548090)

* This update introduces a mechanism that specifies the queue size of a

queue that is setup via the Java API. (BZ#534008)

* Previously, a collector could not be remotely restarted. With this

update, the restart is possible and works as expected. (BZ#543021)

* The usage information for the qpid-config utility (that is, the output of

the "qpid-config -h" command) has been updated to include a brief
explanation of the exchange type. (BZ#506420)

These updated packages include many other bug fixes and enhancements. Users
are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.3 Technical Notes for
information on these changes:

<http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

All Red Hat Enterprise MRG users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues and add these enhancements, as well as
resolving the issues and adding the enhancements noted in the Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 1.3 Technical Notes. After installing the updated packages,
the qpidd service must be restarted ("service qpidd restart") for this
update to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The assignment for groupArray[0].maxAllowed is prior to the calculation, but should be after the calculation.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=628086#c2)  Jon Thomas    2010-08-30 13:08:25 UTC  ``` Easiest way to repro is create one group with quota and use GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT to trim a slot count and observe in negotiatorlog that  a) the slot count is actually reduced such as:  08/30/10 09:00:09 GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT constraint reduces machine count from 39 to 38  b) that the maxAllowed value for groupArray[0] is not set to the reduced value such as:  08/30/10 09:00:09 negotiationtime: finished sort - slots 38 group  auto true quota 1.000000 maxAllowed 39.000000 numsubmits 0 parent -1 child 2  left -1 right -1 i 0  In the above, the maxAllowed value for groupArray[0] should be 38, not 39.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=628086#c3)  Matthew Farrellee    2010-08-30 13:15:36 UTC  ``` Can you simplify with GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT = FALSE?  FAIL/PASS is determined by jobs running or not?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=628086#c4)  Jon Thomas    2010-08-30 14:00:20 UTC  ``` That would likely work, but I tend to look at the logs so I can isolate hfs behavior from matching, preemption, etc issues.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=628086#c5)  Jon Thomas    2010-09-07 20:13:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 445775](attachment.cgi?id=445775&action=diff "owner slots patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=445775&action=edit "owner slots patch") owner slots patch  Patch changes the order so the number of slots relects the machine constraints.  Patch implements NEG_TRIM_OWNER_STARTDS   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=628086#c6)  Matthew Farrellee    2010-09-09 15:49:44 UTC  ``` Built in 7.4.4-0.11 sans NEG_TRIM_OWNER_STARTDS   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=628086#c8)  Tomas Rusnak    2010-09-16 12:21:41 UTC  ``` The GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT and/or NEG_TRIM_OWNER_STARTDS looks like undocumented feature.   Please, could you specify, how to reproduce/verify this, and provide some information, how the parameter affect dynamic group?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=628086#c9)  Matthew Farrellee    2010-09-16 16:14:36 UTC  ``` NEG_TRIM_OWNER_STARTDS does not exist.  GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT assists the Negotiator in converting dynamic group quotas, %'s, in absolute numbers. If you have a pool of 1000 slots and two groups each with 0.5 dynamic quota (50%), the negotiator will assume it can give 500 matches to each group. If in fact 998 of those slots are in Owner state, there are only 2 slots and the split should be 1 each. GROUP_DYNAMIC_MACH_CONSTRAINT provides a way to trim the absolute number of assumed matchable slots to make the absolute quotas more realistic.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
