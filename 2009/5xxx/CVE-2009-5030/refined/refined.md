  "CVE-2009-5030": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Heap memory corruption leading to invalid free by processing certain Gray16 TIFF images",
    "details": "An out-of-bounds heap-based buffer read and write flaw, leading to an invalid free, was found in the tile coder/decoder (TCD) implementation of OpenJPEG. This occurred when releasing previously allocated memory for the TCD encoder handle while processing certain Gray16 TIFF images. A remote attacker could exploit this by providing a specially crafted TIFF image that, when converted to JPEG 2000 format, would lead to application crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Invalid free"
    ],
    "impact": "Application crash, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can provide a specially-crafted TIFF image file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted TIFF image that will then be processed with a vulnerable version of openjpeg. This could be through a website, email, file server etc."
