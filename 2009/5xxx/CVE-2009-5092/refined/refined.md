Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-5092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found within the management interface of Microsoft's FAST ESP enterprise search platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core weakness is that the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it within the management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary Script Execution: Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser when they access the FAST ESP management interface. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Information theft
    *   Defacement of the web page
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other malicious actions performed in the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-Based: The attack can be carried out remotely over the network, typically through a crafted link or by injecting the malicious script into a vulnerable input field or parameter.
*   User Interaction Required: The attacker needs to convince the victim to access the malicious link or page containing the script. This could be done via email, social engineering or a compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Remote Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable FAST ESP instance.
*   Basic Understanding of XSS: The attacker needs to understand how to craft a malicious script that will execute in the context of the victim's browser.
*   Ability to Lure the User: The attacker needs to be able to persuade the victim to click a malicious link or visit the compromised page.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** FAST ESP 5.1.5 and earlier versions are affected.
*   **Severity:** The severity of this vulnerability is rated "High" overall.
*   **CVSS Score:** The provided CVSS v2 score is 2.6 which translates to medium severity and an access vector of network, but some of the analysis notes indicate a higher exploit complexity.
*  **Reported By**: Kentaro OHSHIMA of Renesas Technology reported this vulnerability to IPA.
