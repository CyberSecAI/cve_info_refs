# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The GnuTLS library received a critical security fix and
other updates:
\* CVE-2014-0092: The X.509 certificate verification had
incorrect error handling, which could lead to broken
certificates marked as being valid.
\* CVE-2009-5138: A verification problem in handling V1
certificates could also lead to V1 certificates incorrectly
being handled.
\* CVE-2013-2116: The \_gnutls\_ciphertext2compressed
function in lib/gnutls\_cipher.c in GnuTLS allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read
and crash) via a crafted padding length.
\* CVE-2013-1619: The TLS implementation in GnuTLS did
not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a
noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of
malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to
conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery
attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted
packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169. (Lucky13)
\* CVE-2012-1569: The asn1\_get\_length\_der function in
decoding.c in GNU Libtasn1 , as used in GnuTLS did not
properly handle certain large length values, which allowed
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory
corruption and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted ASN.1 structure.
\* CVE-2012-1573: gnutls\_cipher.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS
did not properly handle data encrypted with a block cipher,
which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption and application crash) via a
crafted record, as demonstrated by a crafted
GenericBlockCipher structure.
\* CVE-2012-0390: The DTLS implementation in GnuTLS
executed certain error-handling code only if there is a
specific relationship between a padding length and the
ciphertext size, which made it easier for remote attackers
to recover partial plaintext via a timing side-channel
attack, a related issue to CVE-2011-4108.
Also some non security bugs have been fixed:
\* Did some more s390x size\_t vs int fixes. (bnc#536809,
bnc#659128)
\* re-enabled "legacy negotiation" (bnc#554084)
\* fix safe-renegotiation for sle10sp3 and sle10sp4 bug
(bnc#554084)
\* fix bug bnc#536809, fix gnutls-cli to abort
connection after detecting a bad certificate

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-24 17:13:28 UTC  ``` While investigating GnuTLS issue [CVE-2014-1959](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1959) ([bug 1065092](show_bug.cgi?id=1065092 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2014-1959 gnutls: incorrect handling of V1 intermediate certificates (GNUTLS-SA-2014-1)")), it was discovered that older versions of GnuTLS were affected by the same problem, with a different root cause.  When using default certificate verification settings, GnuTLS accepted version 1 X.509 certificates as intermediate CAs.  An attacker able to obtain a V1 certificate from a CA trusted by application could generate certificates for other hosts or users that would be accepted by GnuTLS.  This issue affected GnuTLS versions before 2.7.6.  Problem was reported in the following post:  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351/focus=3361](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351/focus%3D3361)  and fixed upstream via:  <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/c8dcbedd1fdc312f5b1a70fcfbc1afe235d800cd>  This did not affect applications that used GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT verification flag, which instructs GnuTLS to allow root CA certificates to be version 1 certificates.  This was set by e.g. gnutls-cli client application in GnuTLS versions affected by this bug.  This issue affects gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Versions used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or current Fedora versions are newer than 2.7.6 and are not affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-25 20:50:09 UTC  ``` It seems this issue was introduced in upstream version 1.2.1 via:  <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/e0516d09a008352a3481ea518001ae3f58840a5f>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-27 07:45:42 UTC  ``` [CVE-2009-5138](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-5138) was assigned to this issue:  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/12127/focus=12227](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/12127/focus%3D12227)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 10:17:14 UTC  ```  Created mingw32-gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1071851](show_bug.cgi?id=1071851 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-5138 mingw32-gnutls: gnutls: incorrect handling of V1 intermediate certificates [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 10:20:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of gnutls as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-03 18:25:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0247 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0247.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-24 17:13:28 UTC  ``` While investigating GnuTLS issue [CVE-2014-1959](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-1959) ([bug 1065092](show_bug.cgi?id=1065092 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2014-1959 gnutls: incorrect handling of V1 intermediate certificates (GNUTLS-SA-2014-1)")), it was discovered that older versions of GnuTLS were affected by the same problem, with a different root cause.  When using default certificate verification settings, GnuTLS accepted version 1 X.509 certificates as intermediate CAs.  An attacker able to obtain a V1 certificate from a CA trusted by application could generate certificates for other hosts or users that would be accepted by GnuTLS.  This issue affected GnuTLS versions before 2.7.6.  Problem was reported in the following post:  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351/focus=3361](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/3351/focus%3D3361)  and fixed upstream via:  <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/c8dcbedd1fdc312f5b1a70fcfbc1afe235d800cd>  This did not affect applications that used GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT verification flag, which instructs GnuTLS to allow root CA certificates to be version 1 certificates.  This was set by e.g. gnutls-cli client application in GnuTLS versions affected by this bug.  This issue affects gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  Versions used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or current Fedora versions are newer than 2.7.6 and are not affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-25 20:50:09 UTC  ``` It seems this issue was introduced in upstream version 1.2.1 via:  <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/e0516d09a008352a3481ea518001ae3f58840a5f>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-27 07:45:42 UTC  ``` [CVE-2009-5138](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-5138) was assigned to this issue:  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/12127/focus=12227](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/12127/focus%3D12227)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 10:17:14 UTC  ```  Created mingw32-gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1071851](show_bug.cgi?id=1071851 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-5138 mingw32-gnutls: gnutls: incorrect handling of V1 intermediate certificates [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 10:20:42 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of gnutls as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1069301#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-03 18:25:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0247 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0247.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated gnutls packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).

It was discovered that GnuTLS did not correctly handle certain errors that
could occur during the verification of an X.509 certificate, causing it to
incorrectly report a successful verification. An attacker could use this
flaw to create a specially crafted certificate that could be accepted by
GnuTLS as valid for a site chosen by the attacker. (CVE-2014-0092)

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS handled version 1 X.509 certificates.
An attacker able to obtain a version 1 certificate from a trusted
certificate authority could use this flaw to issue certificates for other
sites that would be accepted by GnuTLS as valid. (CVE-2009-5138)

The CVE-2014-0092 issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the
Red Hat Security Technologies Team.

Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the GnuTLS library must be restarted.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-25 19:50:59 UTC  ``` It was discovered that GnuTLS X.509 certificate verification code failed to properly handle certain errors that can occur during the certificate verification.  When such errors are encountered, GnuTLS would report successful verification of the certificate, even though verification should end with failure.  A specially-crafted certificate can be accepted by GnuTLS as valid even if it wasn't issued by any trusted Certificate Authority.  This can be used to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against applications using GnuTLS.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-26 09:54:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgment:  This issue was discovered by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of the Red Hat Security Technologies Team.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-26 10:04:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 867911](attachment.cgi?id=867911&action=diff "Patch from Nikos") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=867911&action=edit "Patch from Nikos") Patch from Nikos   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 07:23:31 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in GnuTLS 3.1.22 and 3.2.12: <http://lists.gnutls.org/pipermail/gnutls-devel/2014-March/006794.html> <http://lists.gnutls.org/pipermail/gnutls-devel/2014-March/006795.html>  Upstream advisory id is: GNUTLS-SA-2014-2 <http://gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-2>  Upstream commits (3.2.x, 3.1.x, 2.12.x): <https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/855127da290a280df839038671ae6aba01957736> <https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/a79aed24327cfb2771062956399d5a54ede1e923> <https://www.gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/6aa26f78150ccbdf0aec1878a41c17c41d358a3b>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 07:50:10 UTC  ```  Created mingw-gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1071796](show_bug.cgi?id=1071796 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0092 mingw-gnutls: gnutls: incorrect error handling in certificate verification (GNUTLS-SA-2014-2) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 07:50:15 UTC  ```  Created gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1071795](show_bug.cgi?id=1071795 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0092 gnutls: incorrect error handling in certificate verification (GNUTLS-SA-2014-2) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 07:50:18 UTC  ```  Created mingw32-gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1071797](show_bug.cgi?id=1071797 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2014-0092 mingw32-gnutls: gnutls: incorrect error handling in certificate verification (GNUTLS-SA-2014-2) [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-03 18:26:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0247 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0247.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-03 18:26:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0246 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0246.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1069865#c15)  Fedora Update System    2014-03-06 08:16:54 UTC  ``` gnutls-3.1.20-4.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has two
fixes is now available.
Description:
The GnuTLS library received a critical security fix and
other updates:
\* CVE-2014-0092: The X.509 certificate verification had
incorrect error handling, which could lead to broken
certificates marked as being valid.
\* CVE-2009-5138: A verification problem in handling V1
certificates could also lead to V1 certificates incorrectly
being handled.
\* CVE-2013-2116: The \_gnutls\_ciphertext2compressed
function in lib/gnutls\_cipher.c in GnuTLS allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read
and crash) via a crafted padding length.
\* CVE-2013-1619: Timing attacks against hashing of
padding was fixed which might have allowed disclosure of
keys. (Lucky13 attack).
Also the following non-security bugs have been fixed:
\* gnutls doesn't like root CAs without Basic
Constraints. Permit V1 Certificate Authorities properly
(bnc#760265)
\* memory leak in PSK authentication (bnc#835760)
