  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-5138",
    "description": "A verification problem in handling V1 certificates could also lead to V1 certificates incorrectly being handled.",
    "affected_products": [
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP3",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 for VMware",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 11 SP3",
      "SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP3",

      "SUSE Manager 1.7 for SLE 11 SP2",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5"
    ],
    "root_cause": "GnuTLS incorrectly handles version 1 X.509 certificates, accepting them as intermediate CAs when they should not be.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect certificate verification",
      "Improper handling of V1 certificates"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker able to obtain a V1 certificate from a CA trusted by application could generate certificates for other hosts or users that would be accepted by GnuTLS.",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker needs to obtain a valid V1 certificate from a trusted CA and then create certificates for other hosts or users.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to obtain a valid V1 certificate issued by a certificate authority that is trusted by the vulnerable application.",
    "additional_information": "This issue affects GnuTLS versions before 2.7.6. Applications using the GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT flag were not affected."
