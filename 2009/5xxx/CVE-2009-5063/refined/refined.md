Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-5063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `embedded_profile_len()` function in `pngwutil.c` of the libpng library. This function failed to properly check for negative values when processing the length of embedded profiles within PNG images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Handling Error:** The primary weakness was the lack of validation for negative profile lengths. This allowed a malformed PNG image to specify a negative length, leading to incorrect memory allocation.
*   **Memory Leak/DoS**: When a negative length is used, the library could attempt to allocate a large amount of memory due to treating the negative value as a very large unsigned value. This could cause a memory exhaustion, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. On i386 it could lead to a crash (segfault).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to excessive memory consumption, causing the application using libpng to slow down or crash.
*   **Potential Crash:** As mentioned, on some architectures, this issue resulted in a segmentation fault.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PNG Files:** The primary attack vector involved crafting a specially designed PNG image with a negative embedded profile length.
*   **Image Conversion:**  Software like GraphicsMagick, when used to convert other formats (e.g., JPEG) to PNG, can trigger the vulnerability if the source image metadata leads to the creation of a malformed PNG with a negative profile length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a malformed PNG image to a vulnerable application or a tool that uses libpng to process images. This could occur in a variety of scenarios, including:
    *   A web server processing user-uploaded images.
    *   Image processing software converting images.
    *   Any application that parses untrusted PNG images.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was introduced in libpng version 1.2.13beta1 and fully fixed in 1.2.39beta5.
* An incomplete fix was attempted in 1.2.15beta3.
*  The vulnerability can be triggered during conversion from JPEG to PNG, where the negative value could be introduced in the metadata of the image.
*   The vulnerability was present since 2006 (discovered in the Gentoo bug tracker), with the final fix in 2009.

The provided information from different sources consistently points to a memory handling issue due to a missing negative length check in libpng, leading to potential DoS.
