This document is a release note for Cisco 800 series routers with Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)XA. It contains information on system requirements, new features, and caveats. Several resolved caveats are mentioned which are related to security vulnerabilities, including:

**1. CSCth03022:**
    - **Root cause:** Multiple vulnerabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation.
    - **Weaknesses:** Crafted SIP packets can cause a device reload or trigger memory leaks.
    - **Impact:** Device reload or system instability.
    - **Attack vectors:** Unauthenticated, remote attacker sending crafted SIP packets.
    - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send SIP messages to the affected device. The device must be configured to process SIP messages.

**2. CSCti33534:**
    - **Root cause:**  Issue with IPv6 auto-configuration.
    - **Weaknesses:** Flooding an interface configured with "ipv6 address autoconf" with random IPv6 router advertisements, and then removing the IPv6 configuration, may cause a reload.
    - **Impact:** Device reload and other system instabilities.
    - **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, flooding the targeted device with IPv6 router advertisement messages.
    - **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to be directly connected to the Cisco IOS device to send crafted neighbor discovery messages.

**3. CSCte91259:**
    - **Root cause:** Issue with Dynamic DNS.
    - **Weaknesses:** Using DHCP Client Dynamic DNS update may lead to a bus error and unexpected reload.
    - **Impact:** Device reload.
    - **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the DHCP client dynamic DNS update mechanism on the affected device.
    - **Required capabilities:** The device must be configured to use DHCP client dynamic DNS update.

**4. CSCtg41733:**
    - **Root cause:** Memory leak during SIP UDP REGISTER calls.
    - **Weaknesses:** Certain crafted packets may cause a memory leak in the device.
    - **Impact:** Memory leak potentially leading to instability.
    - **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack involving sending crafted packets to a device configured for SIP processing.
    - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send crafted packets to a device configured for SIP.

**5. CSCsd34855:**
    - **Root cause:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the VTP feature.
    - **Weaknesses:** Receiving a VTP summary advertisement with a VLAN name greater than 100 characters can cause a buffer overflow.
    - **Impact:** Device reset with an Unassigned Exception error, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    - **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted VTP summary advertisement.
    - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send a VTP packet on a trunk enabled port with a matching domain name and VTP password if configured.

**6. CSCtf91428:**
    - **Root cause:** Denial of service vulnerabilities in the NAT functionality related to SIP, H.323, and H.225.0 call signaling for H.323 packets.
    - **Weaknesses:** Vulnerabilities in translation of SIP, H.323, and H.225.0 packets.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
    - **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the Network Address Translation functionality using specially crafted SIP, H.323, and H.225.0 packets.
    - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send crafted SIP, H.323, or H.225.0 packets.

**7. CSCtf17624:**
   - **Root cause:** Denial of service vulnerabilities in the NAT functionality related to SIP.
   -  **Weaknesses:** Vulnerabilities in translation of SIP packets.
   -  **Impact:** Denial of service.
   -  **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the Network Address Translation functionality using specially crafted SIP packets.
   - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send crafted SIP packets.

**8. CSCte14603:**
   - **Root cause:** Vulnerability in the IGMPv3 implementation.
   -  **Weaknesses:** A remote attacker can cause a reload of an affected device by exploiting a vulnerability in IGMPv3.
   -  **Impact:** Device reload, sustained denial of service (DoS) condition.
   -  **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted IGMPv3 messages.
   -  **Required capabilities:** Remote attacker capable of sending crafted IGMPv3 messages.

**9. CSCtd33567:**
    - **Root cause:** Vulnerabilities in the H.323 implementation.
    - **Weaknesses:** Two vulnerabilities that can be exploited to cause a DoS.
    - **Impact:** Denial of Service.
    - **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation of H.323 functionality.
    - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send specific H.323 traffic.

**10. CSCtd86472:**
    - **Root cause:** Denial of service vulnerabilities in the NAT functionality related to SIP, H.323, and H.225.0 call signaling for H.323 packets.
    - **Weaknesses:** Vulnerabilities in translation of SIP, H.323, and H.225.0 packets.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
    - **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the Network Address Translation functionality using specially crafted SIP, H.323, and H.225.0 packets.
    - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send crafted SIP, H.323, or H.225.0 packets.

**11. CSCtf72678:**
    - **Root cause:** Multiple vulnerabilities in the SIP implementation.
    - **Weaknesses:** Crafted SIP packets can cause a device reload.
    - **Impact:** Device reload.
    - **Attack vectors:** Unauthenticated, remote attacker sending crafted SIP packets.
    - **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to send SIP messages to the affected device, which must be configured to process SIP messages.

**12. CSCta19962 & CSCtb93855:**
