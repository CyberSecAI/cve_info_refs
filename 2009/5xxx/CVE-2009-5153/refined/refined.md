The provided content relates to CVE-2009-5153.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack overflow within the Novell NetWare NFS Portmapper daemon. Specifically, the daemon improperly handles a length field in CALLIT RPC calls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow: The daemon trusts the length field provided in the RPC call, and copies data based on this length into a stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- Lack of authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
- Insufficient input validation: The daemon fails to validate the length of the provided data before using it to copy data into a buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution under the context of the vulnerable daemon. This can allow an attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote network access: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- Crafted RPC calls: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted CALLIT RPC calls with an oversized length field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable NetWare server.
- The attacker does not need any authentication credentials.
