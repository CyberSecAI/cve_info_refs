| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c0)  Adam Mariš    2015-07-31 07:44:21 UTC  ``` DL::dlopen could open a library with tainted library name even if $SAFE > 0. This vulnerability affects Ruby versions 1.8, 1.9, 2.1, 2.2.  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/4600cf725a86ce31266153647ae5aa1197b1215b>  Additional information and CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/222>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c1)  Adam Mariš    2015-07-31 07:46:24 UTC  ```  Created ruby tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1248937](show_bug.cgi?id=1248937 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-5147 CVE-2015-7551 ruby: DL::dlopen could open a library with tainted library name [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c2)  Vít Ondruch    2015-07-31 08:11:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to Adam Mariš from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c0)) > DL::dlopen could open a library with tainted library name even if $SAFE > 0. > This vulnerability affects Ruby versions 1.8, 1.9, 2.1, 2.2.  This is hardly true, since DL was removed from Ruby 2.2:  <https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/07308c4d30b8c5260e5366c8eed2abf054d86fe7>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c3)  Mamoru TASAKA    2015-07-31 08:36:16 UTC  ``` First of all, why is this CVE(-2009-5147, note "2009") reported now? The above oss-sec report says that this is already fixed in 1.9.1-p129.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c4)  Adam Mariš    2015-07-31 11:45:41 UTC  ``` Hello!  This bug is only being reported now because the CVE was assigned only two days ago. Because the flaw was patched in 2009, it got a CVE from year 2009. As Vit noted above, this probably does not affect Ruby 2.2 but we still have to look into all other versions to see if they were patched.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c9)  Martin Prpič    2015-12-18 13:50:14 UTC  ``` This flaw has been re-introduced in Fiddle:  "There is an unsafe tainted string vulnerability in Fiddle and DL. This issue was originally reported and fixed with [CVE-2009-5147](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-5147) in DL, but reappeared after DL was reimplemented using Fiddle and libffi.  And, about DL, [CVE-2009-5147](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-5147) was fixed at Ruby 1.9.1, but not fixed at other branches, then rubies which bundled DL except Ruby 1.9.1 are still vulnerable."  <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/12/16/unsafe-tainted-string-usage-in-fiddle-and-dl-cve-2015-7551/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c10)  Fedora Update System    2015-12-29 22:23:35 UTC  ``` ruby-2.2.4-47.fc23 has been pushed to the Fedora 23 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c11)  Fedora Update System    2016-01-08 03:27:19 UTC  ``` ruby-2.2.4-47.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1248935#c12)  Andrej Nemec    2017-09-08 11:55:29 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

# CVE-2015-7551: Unsafe tainted string usage in Fiddle and DL

Posted by usa on 16 Dec 2015

There is an unsafe tainted string usage vulnerability in Fiddle and DL.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
[CVE-2015-7551](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7551).

## Details

There is an unsafe tainted string vulnerability in Fiddle and DL.
This issue was originally reported and fixed with [CVE-2009-5147](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-5147) in DL,
but reappeared after DL was reimplemented using Fiddle and libffi.

And, about DL, [CVE-2009-5147](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-5147) was fixed at Ruby 1.9.1,
but not fixed at other branches, then rubies which bundled DL
except Ruby 1.9.1 are still vulnerable.

Impacted code looks something like this:

```
handle = Fiddle::Handle.new(dangerous_user_input)
```

Or:

```
handle = Fiddle::Handle.new(some_library)
function_pointer = handle[dangerous_user_input]
```

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
the workarounds immediately.

## Affected Versions

* All patch releases of Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby 1.9.3 (DL and Fiddle).
* All patch releases of Ruby 2.0.0 prior to Ruby 2.0.0 patchlevel 648 (DL and Fiddle).
* All versions of Ruby 2.1 prior to Ruby 2.1.8 (DL and Fiddle).
* All versions of Ruby 2.2 prior to Ruby 2.2.4 (Fiddle).
* Ruby 2.3.0 preview 1 and preview 2 (Fiddle).
* prior to trunk revision 53153 (Fiddle).

## Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade, the following monkey patch can be applied as a
workaround for Fiddle:

```
class Fiddle::Handle
  alias :old_initialize :initialize

  def initialize file, *args
    raise SecurityError if file.tainted? && $SAFE > 0
    old_initialize file, *args
  end

  alias :sym :[]
  alias :old_call :[]

  def [] fun
    raise SecurityError if fun.tainted? && $SAFE > 0
    old_call fun
  end
end
```

If you are using DL, use Fiddle instead of it.

## Credits

Thanks to Christian Hofstaedtler zeha@debian.org for reporting this issue!

# Re: CVE request: Two ruby 'dl' vulnerabilities fixed in ruby-1.9.1-p129

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

We can assign an ID for one of these but we have a question about the other.

```
> ```

```

Use CVE-2009-5147.

```
> ```
> * DL::Function#call could pass tainted arguments to a C function even if
> $SAFE > 0.
> <https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/7269e3de3cee3bbb6ab77fc708f3a10cab00b65e>

```

```
> ```
> These seem to be different issues than CVE-2008-3657.
>
> ```

```

Please clarify what research you have done to reach this conclusion
for the DL::Function#call issue. Finding information about
vulnerabilities with different dates does not always mean that
separate CVE IDs are used. For example, if a 2008 patch was
ineffective in the sense that it did not actually fix any aspect of a
CVE-2008-xxxx vulnerability, and then an effective patch and a new
advisory were produced in 2009, the previously assigned CVE-2008-xxxx
ID would continue to be used - there would not be a new CVE-2009-yyyy
ID.

The available information about CVE-2008-3657 includes the "Lack of
taintness check in dl" section of
<https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2008/08/08/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-ruby/>
with "dl doesn't check taintness ... This vulnerability was reported
by sheepman" and "Please upgrade to ... 1.8.7-p72." See the
ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ archives.

Comparing ext/dl/sym.c between p71 and p72 shows a new
rb_check_safe_obj(pval) line in rb_dlsym_call.

Comparing ext/dl/dl.c between p71 and p72 shows new instances of
OBJ_INFECT, among other changes.

The 2009 commit mentions "Patch by sheepman" and a change to a .rb
file (no changes to any .c file).

Is the 2009 issue a new issue because it is specific to a "tainted
arguments to a C function" attack, and the 2008 patch correctly
resolved the 2008 test case involving uname?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c0)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-01 09:08:12 UTC  ``` Ruby through 2.2.7, 2.3.x through 2.3.4, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 can expose arbitrary memory during a JSON.generate call. The issues lies in using strdup in ext/json/ext/generator/generator.c, which will stop after encountering a '\0' byte, returning a pointer to a string of length zero, which is not the length stored in space_len.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/flori/json/commit/8f782fd8e181d9cfe9387ded43a5ca9692266b85>  References:  <https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/13853> <https://hackerone.com/reports/209949>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c1)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-01 09:08:30 UTC  ``` Created ruby tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1487553](show_bug.cgi?id=1487553 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2017-14064 ruby: Arbitrary heap exposure during a JSON.generate call [fedora-all]")]   Created ruby193-ruby tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openshift-1 [[bug 1487554](show_bug.cgi?id=1487554)]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c2)  Doran Moppert    2017-09-06 04:26:39 UTC  ``` This is triggered by passing a string containing \0 in the "opts" argument to JSON.generate - the object being serialised cannot cause memory disclosure to occur.  Normally, this argument can not be influenced by users or potential attackers.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c4)  Adam Mariš    2017-09-15 09:21:20 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/09/14/json-heap-exposure-cve-2017-14064/>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2017-12-19 08:37:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 EUS   Red Hat Software Collections for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 EUS  Via RHSA-2017:3485 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3485](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017%3A3485)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1487552#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2017-12-19 17:06:53 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and 6. These versions do not include the JSON module.  This issue affects the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as well as the versions of rh-ruby22-ruby and rh-ruby23-ruby as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue.
