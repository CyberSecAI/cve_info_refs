{
  "CVE-2009-5147": {
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in the DL module of Ruby, where DL::dlopen could open a library with a tainted library name, even if $SAFE > 0. This allows loading of arbitrary libraries, potentially from user-controlled input.",
    "root_cause": "The `DL::dlopen` function in Ruby's DL module does not properly sanitize or check if a library path is tainted before attempting to open it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Use of Untrusted Data",
      "Unsafe Dynamic Library Loading"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution by loading malicious shared libraries or bypassing security restrictions. Exposure of sensitive information by executing code within the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can control the library path passed to `DL::dlopen`, typically through user input or other means of tainting data. This path is then used to load a library via dlopen or a similar system call.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the string passed to `DL::dlopen` with a tainted library path. This could be through user-provided input, data retrieved from a network or other sources that are not trusted, or through a chain of operations that ultimately taints the library name."
