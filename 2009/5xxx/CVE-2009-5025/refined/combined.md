# [BMSA-2009-07] Backdoor in PyForum

BLUE MOON SECURITY ADVISORY 2009-07
===================================

:Title: Backdoor in PyForum
:Severity: Critical
:Reporter: Blue Moon Consulting
:Products: PyForum v1.0.3
:Fixed in: --

Description
-----------

pyForum is a 100% python-based message board system based in the excellent web2py framework.

We have discovered a backdoor in PyForum. Anyone could force a password reset on behalf of other users whose emails are
known. More importantly, the software author, specifically, can obtain the new Administrator's password remotely.

The problem is in module ``forumhelper.py``. A new password is generated and saved in the database. Then a notification
email which contains this new password in plaintext is sent to the user. There is no password reset confirmation code
or similar verification action required. This causes a mild annoyance, or at most an account lockout.

When it comes to Administrator account, however, the problem is more severe. This default account's email is set to
``administrator () pyforum org`` and can only be changed directly in the database. Therefore, new password is sent to
the software author by default. And since this email address is known, everyone can request a password reset easily.

This bug may exist in older versions and in zForum, from which pyForum derives, too.

Workaround
----------

Change Administrator's email address immediately and do not publish it anywhere.

Fix
---

There is no fix at the moment.

Disclosure
----------

Blue Moon Consulting adapts `RFPolicy v2.0 <<http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/policy.html>>`_ in notifying vendors.

Considered this *an intentional backdoor*, we decided to alert the public immediately.
