{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Cookie Dump Servlet` in Jetty versions up to 6.1.20 is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored XSS vulnerability exists because user-controlled input is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the web application."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application through the Cookie Dump Servlet. These scripts would be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that includes a specially crafted cookie. When the Cookie Dump Servlet processes this request, it stores the malicious code.",
      "A victim user then accesses the affected page (e.g. via the Cookie Dump Servlet UI), which displays the stored malicious code, executing it in their browser"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jetty server to inject the malicious cookie.",
	  "The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or user credentials to inject the malicious code."
