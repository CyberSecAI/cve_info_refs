Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2009-5013:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `pyftpdlib` handles the `QUIT` command during a file transfer. Specifically, when a `QUIT` command is issued while a file transfer (RETR, STOR) is in progress, the server uses `asynchat`'s `close_when_done()` method instead of `close()` after the transfer is completed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The use of `close_when_done()` instead of `close()` leads to a memory leak. The server maintains a reference to the `FTPHandler` instance and the connection socket, preventing garbage collection.
- **Hanging client connection:** The client does not get disconnected after transfer is finished and hangs forever.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeatedly sending a `QUIT` command during transfers will cause memory to accumulate on the server, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
- **Unresponsive Server:** The server may become unresponsive over time due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker establishes a connection to the FTP server.
- The attacker initiates a file transfer (either uploading or downloading a file).
- The attacker sends a `QUIT` command during the ongoing file transfer.
- This causes a memory leak on the server and the client hangs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have network access to the FTP server to establish a connection.
- The attacker needs to be able to issue FTP commands, specifically `QUIT`, while a file transfer is in progress.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was originally reported on the old Google Code site for the project.
- The issue is labeled as both a "bug" and "Security" issue in the project's issue tracker.
- The issue description indicates that the client will hang and the server will keep a reference to FTPHandler instance as well as connection socket object, which are not garbage collected.
