```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input provided through the 'start' GET parameter, allowing for path traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Disclosure via path traversal.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the web server has access to.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a URL that includes a 'start' GET parameter with a path traversal sequence (e.g., ../../), an attacker can access files outside the intended directory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and application. No authentication is required for this vulnerability."
