Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities related to temporary file handling in groff:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the insecure creation of temporary files and directories by various groff scripts. These scripts used predictable paths (often in `/tmp` or the current directory) or insecure methods, making them vulnerable to symlink attacks or other forms of unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Insecure Temporary File Creation in `pdfroff`:**
    *   `pdfroff` script was creating temporary files in a predictable location within `/tmp` or the current directory by default, using `pdf$$.tmp` . This could be influenced by environment variables like `GROFF_TMPDIR`, `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP`.
    *   The initial patch used `mktemp -t -d groffXXXXXX` which lacked error checking and didn't remove the directory.

2.  **Failures in `eqn2graph.sh`, `grap2graph.sh`, `pic2graph.sh`:**
    *   These scripts had duplicated code for creating temporary directories.
    *   If all attempts to create a temporary directory failed, they would proceed to use the last tried path, which could be an existing directory under an attacker's control.

3.  **Insecure File Creation in `gendef.sh` and `doc/fixinfo.sh`:**
    *   These scripts were creating files in `$TMPDIR` (if set) or the current directory without any precautions.
    *   Setting `$TMPDIR` to a shared location like `/tmp` would make these files vulnerable during build.

4.  **Insecure File Creation in `contrib/gdiffmk/tests/runtests.in`:**
    *   This script created files directly in `/tmp` using a predictable name.

5.  **Insufficiently Random Filename Patterns:**
    *   `contrib/groffer/perl/groffer.pl` and `contrib/groffer/perl/roff2.pl` used only four 'X's in filename patterns, making them easier to predict.

6.  **Insecure Example in Documentation:**
    *   `doc/groff.texinfo` and `doc/groff.info-2` had examples that demonstrated saving program output to a file in `/tmp`.

7.  **Insecure Temporary Directory Creation in `configure` and `config.guess`:**
    *   The portable tmp directory creation code was complex and contained insecure mkdir patterns, which were replaced with `mktemp`.
    *   The code had a window where the directory could be created, and not cleaned up if the name was not assigned to $tmp before exiting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker could potentially create symbolic links with the same name as groff's temporary files/directories to point to arbitrary locations, leading to arbitrary file overwrites.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the groff scripts were run with elevated privileges (e.g. during build) and wrote to a location controlled by an attacker, the attacker could gain higher privileges.
*  **Denial of Service:** By filling up `/tmp` or other temporary locations, an attacker could cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** An attacker with local access could set specific environment variables, create malicious symbolic links or modify files in shared directories like /tmp to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Build-time Exploitation:** An attacker could influence the build process of groff, if the vulnerable scripts were run during the build process with a non-safe $TMPDIR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where groff is being used.
*   **Ability to Control Environment Variables:** The attacker may need to control environment variables such as `TMPDIR`, `GROFF_TMPDIR`, `TEMP`, and `TMP`.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to create or manipulate files and symbolic links in the file system, especially in shared temporary directories or directories where the vulnerable scripts are executed.

**Additional Information:**

*   The patch provided replaces insecure temp file creation with `mktemp`, which creates temporary files securely with random file names
*   The patch also ensures the temporary directory is removed after use.
*  Scripts with temporary file handling issues that were not essential were removed to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
