The provided content relates to CVE-2009-5149.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "password of the day" for multiple ARRIS cable modem models is generated using a publicly known algorithm. This algorithm uses the date and a seed as inputs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Predictable password generation:** The use of a publicly known algorithm and the date as input makes the password generation deterministic, and thus predictable.
- **Publicly Known Algorithm:** The algorithm used to generate the "password of the day" is publicly available, allowing anyone to generate the passwords if they know the seed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker with knowledge of the algorithm, the date, and the seed can gain technician access to the vulnerable ARRIS modem. This access can be used to further compromise the modem.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Knowledge of the algorithm used to generate the password.
- Knowledge of the date for which the password needs to be generated.
- Knowledge of the seed used in the algorithm. This can be obtained through web management interface if the attacker has access to it.
