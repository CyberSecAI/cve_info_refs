Package: groff
Version: 1.20.1-4
Severity: grave
File: /usr/bin/pdfroff
Tags: security

According to pdfroff(1) (and my inspection of the source code), pdfroff
uses $$ (the current pid) to create temporary files.  This is extremely
easy to predict, and thus, insecure.

Please fix both the code and the documentation so that they securely
generate (or reference) temporary files.

See attached report; this is indeed a standard anti-pattern resulting in
security vulnerabilities. In Debian I'd be rather tempted to use 'mktemp
-d' to fix this. What do you think?

Nico Golde points out that Openwall have a patch for this. I'm applying
this to the Debian package:

  curl -s '<http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/groff/groff-1.20.1-owl-tmp.diff>' | filterdiff -i '*pdfroff*'

Thanks,

Subject: CVE id request: groff (pdfroff)

Hi,
We got two bug reports in our BTS for groff with security
impact which need CVE ids.

First one:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538330>
pdfroff tool of groff is creating files in a insecure manner
in the /tmp directory.

Second:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538338>
pdfroff tool of groff is calling ghostscript with the
-dSAFER command line option. From the manpage:

       -dSAFER
              Disables  the  "deletefile"  and  "renamefile" operators and the
              ability to open files in any mode other  than  read-only.   This
              strongly  recommended  for spoolers, conversion scripts or other
              sensitive  environments  where  a  badly  written  or  malicious
              PostScript  program  code must be prevented from changing impor-
              tant files.

This allows an attacker to delete or rename arbitrary victim owned files.

Can you allocate CVE ids for that?

Cheers
Nico

Subject: Re: CVE id request: groff (pdfroff)

Hi Nico,

Thank you for forwarding this info in here - it has helped.

Have you notified Werner LEMBERG, the upstream maintainer?

I have some comments on "the first bug" and on groff's temporary file
handling in general:

On Sun, Aug 09, 2009 at 03:48:17PM +0200, Nico Golde wrote:
> First one:

There's a mitigating factor: pdfroff will use $TMPDIR (or one of three
other env vars that it checks) if set.  On Owl, pam_mktemp sets $TMPDIR
to point to the user's private temporary file directory upon PAM session
setup, which is invoked on both remote and console logins, and on cron
job invocations.

I found your trivial patch (pdfroff.sh.diff, 389 bytes) a bit unfinished:

-  WRKFILE=${GROFF_TMPDIR=${TMPDIR-${TMP-${TEMP-"."}}}}/pdf$$.tmp
+  WRKFILE=${GROFF_TMPDIR=$(mktemp -t -d groffXXXXXX)}/pdf$$.tmp

- no check for a possible mktemp error;
- will leave the directory around upon pdfroff termination;
- changes semantics, but does not update documentation (the man page is
explicit on what temporary file directories pdfroff uses).

I included more elaborate changes to pdfroff (both the script and the
man page) in groff-1.20.1-owl-tmp.diff available here:

<http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/groff/>

Other issues I found (and patched in groff-1.20.1-owl-tmp.diff) are:

Bugs in eqn2graph.sh, grap2graph.sh, pic2graph.sh (duplicated code)
where these scripts would fail to properly handle the case when all
attempts to create a temporary directory fail.  In that case, they would
proceed to use the last-tried pathname.  Hopefully, this would just fail
in some weird way, but it is also possible that the directory would in
fact exist and be under someone else's control.  Since this was the last
thing I dealt with today and I was already tired, I opted for the
simplest fix, which was to reset the variable at the end of each loop
iteration.  At a later time, I may drop all non-mktemp code from these
scripts, like I did in other places.

gendef.sh and doc/fixinfo.sh created files in $TMPDIR (if defined) or in
the current directory without any precautions.  Not an issue if $TMPDIR
is safe or is not set, and these are only used during groff build, but
it is an issue if someone sets $TMPDIR to /tmp or to another shared
directory.  I've patched these to use mktemp(1).  gendef.sh is on my
list of files accessed during groff build (which means that it could
have been run but this is not certain); fixinfo.sh is not (so it was
certainly not run during my build but this does not mean much for other
builds).

contrib/gdiffmk/tests/runtests.in created files in /tmp in the worst way
possible.  I've patched it to use mktemp(1), although maybe it should
just use the current directory since it does so in other places anyway.
It is on my list of files accessed during groff build.

contrib/groffer/perl/groffer.pl and contrib/groffer/perl/roff2.pl used
only four X'es in filename patterns.  The reasonable minimum is
considered 6; we typically use 10.  Patched to use 10.

doc/groff.texinfo (source) and doc/groff.info-2 (pre-compiled) contained
an example for invoking an external program with ".sy", saving its
output to a file under /tmp.  Patched to use a file in the current
directory instead, even though this is not perfect.

Finally, we're patching configure and config.guess to use the
mktemp-only code just to be fail-close, even though I understand the
rationale behind the original portable code.  I am also adding a #error
comment to src/roff/groff/pipeline.c, just to save a few minutes next
time I or someone else looks at this code.

That's all for the patch.  However, my grep's also identified potential
issues in install-sh and contrib/groffer/shell/*.  Since these files
were not used during our groff package builds, I opted to remove rather
than patch them.  So I added:

# Remove/disable unused files with temporary file handling issues in them to
# make sure that these are in fact unused.
rm -r contrib/groffer/shell
echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nexit 1' > install-sh

to our groff.spec, and I also had to add
groff-1.20.1-owl-groffer-Makefile.diff to allow groff to build without
the contrib/groffer/shell/* files (their presence was checked by make
even though they were not read).  On systems with Perl, groff uses the
version of groffer written in Perl instead of this shell version, but
there's some risk of it falling back to the shell version if Perl can't
be run for whatever reason.

A related detail is that we force the configure script to detect the
presence of mkstemp(3), we don't take chances:

export ac_cv_func_mkstemp=yes \
%configure

In the case of groff, the fallback code (when mkstemp(3) is not present)
is not that bad, though.

Speaking of my grep's, I used:

fgrep -rl /tmp .
fgrep -rl mktemp .
fgrep -rl tmpnam .
fgrep -rl tempnam .
fgrep -rl TMPDIR .

Then I briefly reviewed the files identified in this way.  Of course, I
could have missed something, yet this would have caught the pdfroff
issue.  We updated Owl-current to this version of groff with pdfroff in
it just 8 days ago, and we were not as careful right away...

No I just dumped this on the list so far and hope that our
maintainer did this. However I CCed groff@....org now.

Yes I saw this, unfortunately those variables aren't set on
Debian.

True this is quick and dirty and can't be considered
complete.

True, I didn't do this as groff removes the files via a trap
before the patch and I missed that GROFF_TMPDIR is not
pointing to a directory that was created for this usage.

Ok, I didn't read the manpage while writing the patch.

The patch looks great and way more clean than my
quick-and-dirty one. Thanks! I forwarded this to the Debian
bug report.

[not stripping this because of the new CC]
Can someone please assign CVE ids to these issues?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Looking into groff's NEWS file, pdfroff was added in version 1.19.2, so
that may be used as "first affected" in CVE description:
