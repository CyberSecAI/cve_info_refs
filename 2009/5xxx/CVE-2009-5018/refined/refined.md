{
  "CVE-2009-5018": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow in gif2png 2.5.3 and earlier allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a long command line argument passed to the gif2png binary.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing overly long command line arguments, specifically an `strcpy` call that fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying them to a fixed size buffer.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Insecure use of strcpy"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by passing a long command-line argument to the `gif2png` binary.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get the vulnerable user to execute the gif2png binary with a crafted long command line argument. This could be through tricking a user into opening a malicious image, or via a web application that uses gif2png to process images."
