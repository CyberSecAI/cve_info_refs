```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `index_inc.php` file, specifically at line 22, where an include statement is used: `include ($inc_ordner . "config.php");`. The `$inc_ordner` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL, leading to Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in `index_inc.php`.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server. This can lead to Remote Command Execution (RCE) by including a shell (e.g., c99 shell) and then passing commands to it via HTTP GET parameters.
- Attack vectors: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index_inc.php` file, setting the `inc_ordner` parameter to a URL pointing to a malicious file, followed by the commands to be executed.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They need access to a publicly hosted malicious shell.
