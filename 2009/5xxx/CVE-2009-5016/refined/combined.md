code could allow an attacker to bypass cross-site scripting (XSS)

protections. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, Ubuntu 8.04 LTS,

and Ubuntu 9.10. ([CVE-2009-5016](/security/CVE-2009-5016))

It was discovered that the XML UTF-8 decoding code did not properly

handle non-shortest form UTF-8 encoding and ill-formed subsequences

in UTF-8 data, which could allow an attacker to bypass cross-site

scripting (XSS) protections. ([CVE-2010-3870](/security/CVE-2010-3870))

It was discovered that attackers might be able to bypass open\_basedir()

restrictions by passing a specially crafted filename. ([CVE-2010-3436](/security/CVE-2010-3436))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that a NULL pointer derefence in the

ZIP archive handling code could allow an attacker to cause a denial

of service through a specially crafted ZIP archive. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and Ubuntu

10.10. ([CVE-2010-3709](/security/CVE-2010-3709))

It was discovered that a stack consumption vulnerability in the

filter\_var() PHP function when in FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL mode, could

allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 9.10, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, and

Ubuntu 10.10. ([CVE-2010-3710](/security/CVE-2010-3710))

It was discovered that the mb\_strcut function in the Libmbfl

library within PHP could allow an attacker to read arbitrary memory

within the application process. This issue only affected Ubuntu

10.10. ([CVE-2010-4156](/security/CVE-2010-4156))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that an integer overflow in the

NumberFormatter::getSymbol function could allow an attacker to cause

a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 10.10. ([CVE-2010-4409](/security/CVE-2010-4409))

Rick Regan discovered that when handing PHP textual representations

of the largest subnormal double-precision floating-point number,

the zend\_strtod function could go into an infinite loop on 32bit

x86 processors, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-4645](/security/CVE-2010-4645))

What do you propose to solve this bug?  ``` **[2009-09-29 01:58 UTC] sird at rckc dot at** ``` it is a PHP bug, the function is not decoding correctly, check the ppt and the acunetix blog for details.  there are several bugs in the code, one of them is that a variable holding the value of the char is overflowed (trying to put 21 bits in a 16 bits int), also the code is not checking if it is a valid unicode char (reading unicode specification should explain it).  the example root@80sec gave you was an overlong utf representation of a single quote. that is forbidden by unicode, and should transform the char to ?.  also, the code is not checking if the chars are valid UTF, so stuff like: <img alt="\x90" title=" src=x:x onerror=alert(1)//"> are going to be transformed to <img alt="? title=" src=x:x onerror=alert(1)//">   this is a very serious vulnerability and there are several bugs in the same function (there's even unreachable code).  you can check the implementation of utf by Mozilla or Webkit, they do it right. dont use java as a reference since they are also flawed.  due to the fact that PHP is for web applications and utf is widely used, and it allows an attacker to do all type of attacks (from sql injection to xss) its imperative to fix that function.  Greetings!!  ``` **[2009-09-29 04:56 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` > there are several bugs in the code, one of them is that a variable holding the value of the char is overflowed (trying to put 21 bits in a 16 bits int)  That was fixed in 5.2.11  ``` **[2009-09-29 05:29 UTC] sird at rckc dot at** ``` the rest is still dangerous.. eating chars without the 10xx xxxx is against the spec, and overlong UTF.  ``` **[2009-10-16 01:36 UTC] sird at rckc dot at** ``` : rasmus@php.net  It has come to my attention that this hasn't been fixed..  unsigned int has a size of 16 bits, don't take my word for it  <http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/1.2.html>  Section: 1.2.2 Variables  unsigned int  	16 bits  I just downloaded PHP 5.2.11, and I quote the code:   //  php-5.2.11.tar.bz2/php-5.2.11/ext/xml/xml.c#558 PHPAPI char *xml_utf8_decode(    //  ... { 	int pos = len; 	char *newbuf = emallo    //  ... 	unsigned int c;          // sizeof(unsigned int)==16 bits 	char (*decoder)(unsig    //  ... 	xml_encoding *enc = x    //  ... //  ... //  #580 	c = (unsigned char)(*s); 	if (c >= 0xf0) { /* four bytes encoded, 21 bits */ 		if(pos-4 >= 0) { 			c = ((s[0]&7)<<18) | ((s[1]&63)<<12) | ((s[2]&63)<<6) | (s[3]&63); 		} else { 			c = '?';	 		} 		s += 4; 		pos -= 4; //  ...  Also no checking at ALL is made on the leading bytes (they should be in the form: 10xx xxxx, a check is very easy, to check if s[0] has the correct form: you do an AND with 1100 0000 and then compare it with 1000 0000.  s[0]&0xC0==0x80  Also, Overlong UTF is not being taken care of, that's yeah, yet another vulnerability.

I've made a blogpost that explains the other issues ;)  <http://sirdarckcat.blogspot.com/2009/10/couple-of-unicode-issues-on-php-and.html>  I updated the post to note the last bug was fixed on 5.2.11  Greetings!!  ``` **[2009-10-16 04:01 UTC] [scottmac@php.net](//people.php.net/scottmac)** ``` PHP 5 has binary strings, not utf-8 strings. It does not attempt to do any validation on input, so expecting addslashes to magically validate things as utf-8 is wrong, simple as.  I agree that utf8_decode should do proper validation here though the overhead of doing that validation is going to be slow. So I've coded up a utf8_validate function. Still need to sort out some of the behaviour first.  ``` **[2009-10-16 04:41 UTC] sird at rckc dot at** ``` I disagree.. how slow can it be to add 2 bit operations..  } else if (c < 0x800) {  change to  } else if (c < 0x800) {     if ( (s[1]&0xC0!=0x80) ){  // this is a new operation         newbuf[(*newlen)++] = '?'; // this are not new operations         pos--; // this are not new operations         s++; // this are not new operations         continue;     } }  Besides, considering all real implementations do what the spec say they should do (it's not validate it's valid UNICODE, is that UNICODE says that the algorithm SHOULD do the check).. not doing it on PHP is just nuts.  ``` **[2009-10-16 04:45 UTC] sird at rckc dot at** ``` oh, my mistake: 		else if (c < 0x800) { 			newbuf[(*newlen)++] = (0xc0 | (c >> 6)); 			newbuf[(*newlen)++] = (0x80 | (c & 0x3f)); 		}  should be:  		else if (c < 0x800) {                         if ( (s[1]&0xC0!=0x80) ){                             newbuf[(*newlen)++] = '?';                         }else{ 			    newbuf[(*newlen)++] = (0xc0 | (c >> 6)); 			    newbuf[(*newlen)++] = (0x80 | (c & 0x3f));                         } 		}  ``` **[2009-10-16 04:52 UTC] sird at rckc dot at** ``` Oh, duh!

### [A couple of unicode issues on PHP and Firefox](http://sirdarckcat.blogspot.com/2009/10/couple-of-unicode-issues-on-php-and.html)

Well, here I am developing ACS, finding that this project resembles at some degree the creation of a browser.. but anyway, it's close to a working beta (yay!).

In any case, a couple of bugs came to my attention, some of them are public, some of them are not.

First of all, I want to describe the PHP vulnerability I made public on my presentation with David Lindsay, at [Blackhat USA 2009](http://sirdarckcat.blogspot.com/2009/08/our-favorite-xss-filters-and-how-to.html), that apparently only [Chris Weber](https://twitter.com/christoweb/status/3130572209), [Giorgio Maone (creator of NoScript)](http://noscript.net/changelog#1.9.6.1), [Mario Heiderich (creator of PHP-IDS)](http://php-ids.org/) and the [Acunetix security team](http://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-articles/security-risks-associated-with-utf8_decode/) have realized the danger of it.

It has been reported, well, [more than enough times](http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=48230) to the PHP team (I made another attempt today, hoping this will get fixed in some time soon.. if at all). This issue affects all PHP versions Mario Heiderich and me could test, and endangers practically all PHP programs that use the [utf8\_decode()](http://php.net/utf8_decode) function for decoding (as recommended by OWASP guidelines).

You can check the bug here:

<http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=49687>

In reality there are several vulns in just a couple of lines, so I'll describe them here:

1.- **Overlong UTF-8:**
> As REQUIRED by UNICODE 3.1, and noted in the Unicode Technical Report #36, UTF-8 is forbidden to interpretate a character's non-shortest form.

<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/#UTF-8_Exploit>

**VULN: *PHP makes no checks whatsoever on this matter.***

**Why is this a vulnerability?**

A filter (such as addslashes, htmlentities, escapeshellarg, etc.) will NOT be able to detect&escape such byte sequences, and so an application that relies on them for security checks wont be protected at all. Because it allows an attacker to encode "dangerous" chars, such as ', ", <, ;, &, \0 in different ways:

' = %27 = %c0%a7 = %e0%80%a7 = %f0%80%80%a7

" = %22 = %c0%a2 = %e0%80%a2 = %f0%80%80%a2

< = %3c = %c0%bc = %e0%80%bc = %f0%80%80%bc

; = %3b = %c0%bb = %e0%80%bb = %f0%80%80%bb

& = %26 = %c0%a6 = %e0%80%a6 = %f0%80%80%a6

\0= % 00 = %c0%80 = %e0%80%80 = %f0%80%80%80

[Use hackvertor to generate them.](http://www.businessinfo.co.uk/labs/hackvertor/hackvertor.php#JiA9IDxAb3ZlcmxvbmdfdXRmOF8wKDEpPiY8QC9vdmVybG9uZ191dGY4XzA%2BID0gPEBvdmVybG9uZ191dGY4XzEoMik%2BJjxAL292ZXJsb25nX3V0ZjhfMT4gPSA8QG92ZXJsb25nX3V0ZjhfMigzKT4mPEAvb3ZlcmxvbmdfdXRmOF8yPiA9IDxAb3ZlcmxvbmdfdXRmOF8zKDQpPiY8QC9vdmVybG9uZ191dGY4XzM%2B)

Enabling attacks on systems that use addslashes for example (but almost all encoding functions would be vulnerable):

> // add slashes!
>
> foreach($\_GET as $k=>$v)$\_GET[$k]=**addslashes**("$v");
>
>
>
> //  .... some code ...
>
>
>
> // $name is encoded in utf8
>
> $name=**utf8\_decode**($\_GET['name']);
>
> mysql\_query("SELECT \* FROM table WHERE name='$name';");
>
>
>
> ?>

2.- **Ill formed sequences**:

As REQUIRED by UNICODE 3.0, and noted in the Unicode Technical Report #36, if a leading byte is followed by an invalid successor byte, then it should NOT consume it.

    <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/#Ill-Formed_Subsequences>

**VULN: *PHP will consume invalid bytes.***

**Why is this a vulnerability?**

It will allow an attacker to "eat" controll chars. For example:

> // htmlentities
>
> foreach($\_GET as $k=>$v)$\_GET[$k]=**htmlentities**("$v",ENT\_QUOTES);
>
>
>
> //  ... some code ...
>
>
>
> $name=$\_GET['name'];
>
> $url=$\_GET['url'];
>
>
>
> //  ... some code ...
>
>
>
> $profileImage="<img alt=\"Photo of $name\" src=\"http://$url\" />";
>
>
>
> // ... some code ...
>
> echo **utf8\_decode**($profileImage);
>
> ?>

A request such as:

?name=%90&src=%20onerror=alert(1)%20

Will execute the code "alert(1)" when the page loads.

Note that htmlpurifier does a utf8\_decode function call at the end of the decoding, BUT they are safe because of a pre-encoding made by htmlpurifier.. other codes that do the same wont be so lucky.

Bogdan Calin from Acunetix WVS described a couple of other potential attack scenarios:

> [![](http://www.acunetix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/xss_utf8_decode.PNG)](http://www.acunetix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/xss_utf8_decode.PNG)

Where an attacker could fool the filter by doing a request like:

vuln.php?input=**%F6%3Cimg+onmouseover=prompt(/xss/)//%F6%3E**

And:

>

Where an attacker could fool the filter by doing a request like:

index.php?username=**test%FC%27%27+or+1=1+–+**&password=a

3.- **Integer overflow:**

Unsigned short has a size of 16 bits (2 bytes), that is UNCAPABLE of storing unicode characters of 21 bits, and represented on UTF with 4 bytes (1111 0xxx 10xx xxxx 10xx xxxx 10xx xxxx). PHP attempts to sum a 21 bits value to a 16 bits-size variable, and then makes no checks on the value.

The affected code follows:

> //  php/ext/xml/xml.c#558
>
> PHPAPI char \*xml\_utf8\_decode(    //  ...
>
> {
>
>     int pos = len;
>
>     char \*newbuf = emallo    //  ...
>
>     unsigned short c;          // **sizeof(unsigned short)==16** bits
>
>     char (\*decoder)(unsig    //  ...
>
>     xml\_encoding \*enc = x    //  ...
>
> //  ...
>
> //  #580
>
>     c = (unsigned char)(\*s);
>
>     if (c >= 0xf0) {         /\* **four bytes encoded, 21** bits \*/
>
>         if(pos-4 >= 0) {
>
>             c = (**(s[0]&7)<<18) | ((s[1]&63)<<12)** | ((s[2]&63)<<6) | (s[3]&63);
>
>         } else {
>
>             c = '?';
>
>         }
>
>         s += 4;
>
>         pos -= 4;
>
> //  ...

The relevant part of the code is of course, the declaration of c as an unsigned int, the comment specifing that the char is 21 bits, and this:
> x= ((s[0]&7)<<18) | ...

s[0]&7<<18 means it will move 3 bits, 18 bits to the right. As we noted before.. c's size is only 16 bits.
> (xxxx xxxx & 0000 0111) << 18

Also, this part:
> ...  ((s[1]&63)<<12) | ...

s[1]&63<<12 means it will move 6 bits, 12 bits to the right. So, 2 bits are going to be lost.
> (xxxx xxxx & 0011 1111) << 12

This allows us to make something even more interesting.

Code like this:

**%FF%F0%40%FC** that is invalid unicode, overlong, and all you want (definatelly NOT valid), will be casted as a "lower than" simbol (<).

<http://eaea.sirdarckcat.net/xss.php?unicode&html_xss=%FF%F0%40%FC>

This besides the already mentioned problems, and the possibility of bypassing quite a lot of WAFs and Filters.. demonstrate the problem of a bad unicode implementation on PHP.

I hope the PHP development team acknowledges all this issues that have been reported before, and were explained some months ago on Blackhat USA (and the developers were noticed to check the ppt more than once), and now are explained yet another time.

**This was fixed on 5.2.11 :) on my birthday!! Sept 17**

Anyway.. that's not all, now to finish this post I want to publish a overlong utf-8 exception on Firefox (actually, Mozilla's).

# The firefox one

Firefox is supposed to consider the non-shortest form exception (point #1 in the PHP vulnerabilities), and section 3.1 of the Unicode Technical Report #36 but apparently there's a flaw on it. This is specially problematic for the reasons that an overlong unicode sequence not taken into consideration may allow several types of filter bypasses.

Anyway, the severity of this vulnerability is not as high as the PHP ones, but is worth mentioning. The following non-shortest form for the char U+1000:
> 0xF0 0x81 0x80 0x80

is allowed, as well as the correct shortest form:
> 0xE1 0x80 0x80

Note that this problem is only present on the 4 bytes representation.

You can track this bug at:

<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522634>

Anyway, that's all! Thanks for your time :)

Greetings!!
