This plugin was very useful a few years ago. Now, the admin page has an error, it breaks the theme editor, and causes various other issues.

The subject line is the only info that is send but no instructions how to authenticate.
I searched for an hour but couldn’t find the answer.
I guess it’s me but I am not sure.
Look forward to a solution to have it enabled.
