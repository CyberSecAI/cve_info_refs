{
  "CVE-2009-5022": {
    "Description": "The libtiff OJPEG decoder contains a heap buffer overflow when decoding certain malformed data.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency between the ImageWidth tag in the TIFF file's IFD and the width specified in the JPEG data's SOF0 marker. The OJPEG decoder allocates buffers based on the TIFF IFD image width while the JPEG decoder writes data based on the width in the SOF0 marker, leading to a buffer overflow if the SOF0 width is larger.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application or a Denial of Service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted TIFF file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malformed TIFF image with a larger width in the JPEG SOF0 marker than in the TIFF IFD. The attacker must then entice a user to open this crafted TIFF file."
