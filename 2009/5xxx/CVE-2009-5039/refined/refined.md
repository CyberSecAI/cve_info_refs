    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerability in H.323 gatekeeper implementation
    - **Impact:** Device crash.
    - **Attack Vector:** Sending specific malicious traffic to the H.323 gatekeeper
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Sending specific crafted traffic to the H.323 gatekeeper.

**5. CSCtg41733:**
    -  **Root Cause:** Memory leak during SIP UDP REGISTER calls when fuzzing.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory leak in SIP processing.
    - **Impact:** Potential resource exhaustion leading to system instability.
    -  **Attack Vector:** Sending certain crafted packets, when SIP processing is enabled.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities**: An attacker needs to send crafted packets to a Cisco IOS device that is configured for SIP processing.

**6. CSCsd34855:**
    - **Root Cause:** Buffer overflow in VTP when receiving a VLAN name greater than 100 characters.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Buffer overflow in the VTP implementation.
    - **Impact:**  Device reset and potential arbitrary code execution.
    - **Attack Vector:**  Sending a VTP summary advertisement with a long VLAN name (over 100 characters) on a trunk enabled port.
    -  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker must be on the same VTP domain and have a matching password (if configured).

**7. CSCtf91428 & CSCtf17624:**
    - **Root Cause:** Denial of service vulnerabilities in Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in NAT processing of SIP and H.323 packets.
    - **Impact:** Denial of service.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted SIP or H.323 packets to be processed by NAT.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities**: An attacker needs to send crafted packets to a device performing NAT on SIP or H.323 packets.

**8. CSCte14603:**
   - **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) version 3 implementation.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerability in how IGMPv3 is processed.
   - **Impact**: Remote unauthenticated attacker can cause a device reload. Repeated attempts can cause sustained DoS
    - **Attack Vector**: Sending malicious IGMPv3 packets.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities**: Remote unauthenticated attacker.

**9. CSCtd33567, CSCta19962, CSCtb93855**
    - **Root Cause:** Multiple vulnerabilities in the H.323 implementation.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in how Cisco IOS software processes H.323 messages.
    - **Impact:** Remote DoS on vulnerable devices.
    - **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted H.323 packets.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Remote access and the ability to send crafted H.323 traffic to the affected device.

**10. CSCtd86472**
   - **Root Cause:** DoS vulnerability in Cisco IOS NAT when handling SIP, H.323 and H.225.0 call signaling for H.323 packets.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Improper handling of NAT with SIP and H.323 packets.
    - **Impact:** DoS.
    - **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted packets to be processed by NAT.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Attacker needs to send crafted SIP and/or H.323 packets to a Cisco IOS device that is performing NAT.

**11. CSCtf72678**
  -   **Root Cause**: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation.
    -   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerabilities in how Cisco IOS software processes SIP messages.
