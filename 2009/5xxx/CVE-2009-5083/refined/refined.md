Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the OpenID Relying Party (RP) in IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager not properly validating the returned claimed identifier during an OP-identifier login. Specifically, the RP fails to reject the login attempt if the OpenID Provider (OP) returns an OP-Identifier as the claimed identifier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The core weakness is the missing validation to ensure the returned claimed identifier is not an OP-identifier itself. The RP should reject login attempts when it discovers the returned claimed identifier is an OP identifier instead of a user identifier.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By accepting an OP-identifier as a valid claimed identifier, the system allows a potential bypass of the intended authentication flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** A malicious OP could potentially exploit this vulnerability by returning its own OP-identifier as the claimed identifier for a user. This would allow the attacker to bypass normal authentication procedures and gain unauthorized access to the system or resources protected by the relying party.
- **Impersonation:** Depending on how the Relying Party uses the claimed identifier, an attacker might be able to impersonate a user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious OpenID Provider:** An attacker would need to control or compromise an OpenID Provider (OP). This OP would then be used to respond to authentication requests with the malicious OP-Identifier as the claimed identifier.
- **OpenID Relying Party Interaction:** The attack occurs during the standard OpenID authentication flow when the Relying Party interacts with the compromised OpenID Provider.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control of an OpenID Provider:** The attacker needs to have control over an OpenID provider to manipulate the returned claimed identifier.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs to target systems using vulnerable versions of IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager and utilize its OpenID RP functionality with OP-identifier login.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It includes information on affected components, versions, and fix availability.
- The content specifies that this issue affects only OpenID relying-party configurations during OP-identifier login.
- The fix involves validating that the discovered information for the claimed identifier is not an OP identifier.
