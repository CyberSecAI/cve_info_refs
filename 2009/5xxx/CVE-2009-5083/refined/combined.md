## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  If an OP returns an OP-Identifier as the claimed identifier
  then the Relying-Party does not reject the login and allows
  authentication to succeed. The Replying-Party should reject
  the login. This issue affects only OpenID relying-party
  configurations during OP-identifier login.

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  No workaround

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  When doing discovery of a claimed identifier after an
  OP-identifier login we now validate that the discovered
  information for the claimed identifier is not an OP
  identifier.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  The fix for this APAR will be contained in the following
  maintenance packages:
  | fix pack | 6.2.0-TIV-TFIM-FP0002 |
