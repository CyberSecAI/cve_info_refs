## Version History

Here you can see the complete history of Monkey's Audio development.

Version 10.92 (January 24, 2025)

1. Changed: Updated the APE interface version and changed the input variables from BOOL to bool (standard C++ instead of Windows specific).

Version 10.91 (January 20, 2025)

1. Changed: Unsupported types (like ALAC when iTunes isn't installed) won't be added to the Add File dialog.
2. Changed: Some internal code restructuring (please report any issues).

Version 10.90 (January 18, 2025)

1. Fixed: The toolbar could draw incorrectly when dragging between monitors.
2. Changed: Preventing drag off the screen of options uses the working rectangle instead of the monitor rectangle so the start menu can no longer be covered.

Version 10.89 (January 17, 2025)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.12.4.
2. Changed: Change to how the DPI change message is routed so it uses a more common MFC framework.

Version 10.88 (January 14, 2025)

1. Changed: When dragging the window from one scale monitor to another scale monitor the size could shift unexpectedly (now the window resizes using the system provided size).

Version 10.87 (January 4, 2025)

1. Changed: The progress percentage is output to the command line window name.

Version 10.86 (December 28, 2024)

1. Changed: Added RF64 and BW64 as supported file extensions (only WAV extension with that data was supported before).

Version 10.85 (December 10, 2024)

1. Changed: Made readers no longer report pipes, but instead just flag it by returning an unknown length.
2. Changed: Made the non-Windows file reader report unknown length for pipes (should help pipes on other platforms).

Version 10.84 (December 9, 2024)

1. Fixed: When input data was from a pipe, it would still ask the file for the length which often returned 0 so the encode would fail. Now it returns a special value for pipes. Please report any issues.

Version 10.83 (December 4, 2024)

1. Fixed: Converting FLAC files didn't retain the lyrics.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.12.3.

Version 10.82 (November 29, 2024)

1. Fixed: Revised how the path is loaded for the Winamp plugin install to hopefully fix problems with Wine and possibly other systems.
2. Changed: Removed the ENABLE\_COMPRESSION\_MODE\_ defines from the old decoding code. Turn off APE\_BACKWARDS\_COMPATIBILITY if you don't want the old modes.
3. Changed: Turned backwards compatibility back on for Android because it builds fine.
4. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.12.2.

Version 10.81 (November 20, 2024)

1. Changed: A tooltip is shown over truncated list elements with the full text.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.12.1.

Version 10.80 (November 7, 2024)

1. Changed: Renewed the code signing certificate for another year.
2. Changed: Updated the definition of APE\_TAG\_FIELD\_COVER\_ART\_FRONT so only the extension needs to be stored before the image data (but loading should check for full filenames as well).
3. Changed: Conversion of FLAC files with PNG files instead of JPEG files works nicely to make images in the APE tags.
4. Changed: Binary values and large values show a little nicer in the tag display of File Info (Ctrl+I).

Version 10.77 (October 16, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.11.5.
2. Changed: Removed a couple global variables.
3. Changed: Removed the Kill function from IAPECompress because it wasn't doing anything.
4. Changed: Updated the years to 2025.
5. Fixed: Corrected a couple warnings that the latest compiler exposed.

Version 10.76 (August 15, 2024)

1. Fixed: UTF-16 CUE files can be processed by the Make APL tool (and UTF-8 will be used otherwise instead of ANSI).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.11.0.

Version 10.75 (August 11, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.10.5.
2. Changed: Corrected a few warnings surfaced by the updated compiler. Also updated naming of a few variables.

Version 10.74 (June 13, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.10.2.
2. Changed: Updated to 10.0.26100.0 Windows SDK.
3. Changed: Removed libFLAC++.dll because it isn't used by FLAC.exe (please let me know if it's needed for anything).

Version 10.73 (May 14, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.9.7.
2. Changed: Corrected a couple more warnings in the new FLAC tag code from the latest Visual Studio update.

Version 10.72 (May 4, 2024)

1. Fixed: Copying FLAC tags breaks out when it finds the last frame instead of still looping the file which fixes crashes on certain files.
2. Changed: Updated the installer to NSIS 3.10.
3. Changed: Updated to version 2.82 of the ALAC tool.

Version 10.71 (April 19, 2024)

1. Changed: Cleaned up all the warnings in the new FLAC tag code.

Version 10.70 (April 18, 2024)

1. NEW: When converting from FLAC the tags are copied. If there are additional tags you have that are not being copied, [please provide a sample](contact.html).

Version 10.65 (April 16, 2024)

1. Fixed: APE files larger than 4 GB would not decode properly for the last while (because the RF64\_HEADER was not getting allocated).

Version 10.64 (April 16, 2024)

1. Changed: More version cleanup (should be internal changes, but please report any issues).

Version 10.63 (April 16, 2024)

1. Changed: Moved some of the older decoding code into a separate class (please report any issues).
2. Changed: APE\_BACKWARDS\_COMPATIBILITY caps at version 3.99 files (files date from before 2004).

Version 10.62 (April 15, 2024)

1. Changed: The options and about dialogs can no longer be dragged off the monitor they were started on (because the scale is loaded one time and different monitors could have different scales).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.9.6.

Version 10.61 (March 27, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.9.5.

2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.9.3.
3. Fixed: A compile problem on Gentoo Linux about casting the sample rate as a double.

Version 10.55 (March 12, 2024)

1. Changed: Switched DirectShow Filter install to the InstallLib command in NSIS and removed the parts in the Monkey's Audio program (filters should still register, but please report any issues).

Version 10.54 (March 11, 2024)

1. Fixed: The DirectShow filter did not install 64-bit version properly so 64-bit DirectX programs could not find it (NSIS did not register 64-bit DLLs properly).
2. Fixed: Cleaned up the DirectShow Filter because it had some preprocessor defines causing problems in some configurations, also removed a pin name causing Clang warnings (MSDN said it was obsolete). Please report any issues.

Version 10.53 (March 6, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to WavPack 5.7.0 (uses threads for better performance).
2. Changed: Moved the build signing to the build script from the compiler settings (should be internal change, but please report any issues).

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.9.2.
2. Changed: Split the Direct Show SDK off to a seperate library.
3. Changed: Enabled Clang on the remaining Direct Show filter code and worked through the warnings.

Version 10.51 (February 22, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.9.1 (fixes possible problem with older CPUs due to a compiler bug).

Version 10.50 (February 14, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.9.0.
2. Changed: Updated to version 2.81 of the ALAC tool.

Version 10.49 (February 9, 2024)

1. Fixed: Adding data with lock and unlock buffer was not doing floating point processing like the other ways to add.

Version 10.48 (January 31, 2024)

1. Changed: The range lookup table is created at construction time of the bit array for the appropriate version so it won't need to be checked each call (please report any issues).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.8.6.
3. Changed: Now use APE\_NULL solution wide instead of NULL sometimes.

Version 10.47 (January 30, 2024)

1. Changed: Switched to APE\_NULL for the range table creation checks.
2. Changed: Corrected a couple warnings about data type conversion.

Version 10.46 (January 29, 2024)

1. Changed: Switched the range tables to smart pointers so only the one being used will be built.

Version 10.45 (January 26, 2024)

1. Changed: Switched the range table lookup tables to members from statics to avoid possible race conditions.

Version 10.44 (January 23, 2024)

1. Fixed: Building APE\_INFO\_WAV\_TOTAL\_BYTES was not working properly because it read the header and footer size before they were loaded.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.8.5.

Version 10.43 (January 11, 2024)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.8.4.
2. Fixed: Corrected a couple warnings that snuck in from the last changes.

Version 10.42 (January 6, 2024)

1. Fixed: Encoding files with the same name at the same time could fail to build an output filename because it would get a unique name then it could be gone by the time it used it. Now it tries again.

Version 10.41 (January 6, 2024)

1. NEW: Auto works for output filenames when compressing from the command line (just like auto for decoding).
2. Changed: Failures decoding legacy files better raises the actual error code (instead of just being undefined).
3. Changed: Made an internal change to the buffering readers to simply reject write calls (please report any issues).
4. Changed: Switched some variables to smart pointers (also internal change, but please report any issues).

Version 10.40 (January 3, 2024)

1. Fixed: The new header reader was not reporting position correctly so some files would fail to encode.

Version 10.39 (January 3, 2024)

1. Changed: The list no longer updates when paused (it would flicker).
2. Fixed: Compressing float files that were not marked as 32 bits per sample would not work properly.
3. Fixed: WAV files that report chunk sizes that exceed the size of the file now fail with an invalid input file error.

Thanks to Minseo Kim and DongEun Kim of the WHS WWW Team for their help finding and fixing these problems.

Version 10.38 (December 22, 2023)

1. Changed: Made the sanity check for WAV headers that are too large 8 MB instead of 1 MB (a user sent a file with an over 1 MB header) (now the same size is checked at encode and decode).

Version 10.37 (December 19, 2023)

1. Changed: Added support for files with the header format all zeroes (instead of KSDATAFORMAT\_SUBTYPE\_PCM, etc.).

Version 10.36 (December 17, 2023)

1. Changed: Made the new header reader support seeking because it was necessary for AIFF files.

Version 10.35 (December 17, 2023)

1. Changed: Made the new header reader simply fail on seek (seek shouldn't be necessary).
2. Changed: Switched to smart pointers for the I/O objects in the encoding stage.
3. Fixed: The header reader was not always returning the number of bytes read properly.

Version 10.34 (December 16, 2023)

1. Fixed: Reading the header (recent addition) was causing problems with some files.

Version 10.33 (December 16, 2023)

1. Changed: Made the program detect the incoming file type by reading the header instead of looking at the extension (makes W64 with WAV extensions work, etc.).
2. Changed: Added support for files with the BW64 header.

Version 10.32 (December 15, 2023)

1. Fixed: WAV files with extra markers that said they were float (support added a few builds ago) were not always processing properly.

Version 10.31 (December 15, 2023)

1. Fixed: Big endian conversion was not accounting for channels properly so files could fail to decode properly.

Version 10.30 (December 13, 2023)

1. Fixed: WAV files with an extra marker would only encode if they were PCM (float wasn't passing the test).
2. Fixed: Floating point AIFF compression was not working properly.
3. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.8.3.
4. Changed: Revised code signing. Internal change, but please report any issues.

Version 10.29 (November 24, 2023)

1. Changed: Switched some memory operations to use better sizing so they adjust automatically as variables change.
2. Changed: Enabled Clang-Tidy on the Direct Show filter and worked through some of the warnings.

Version 10.28 (November 21, 2023)

1. Fixed: Corrected a possible issue decoding 3930 to 3950 files.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.8.1.

Version 10.27 (November 16, 2023)

1. Changed: APE tag details are reported for WavPack files when viewing file information.
2. NEW: When converting a WavPack file to APE, the APE tag is copied.
3. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.8.0.

Version 10.26 (November 7, 2023)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.6.
2. Changed: Added a digital signature to the DirectShow filter.
3. Changed: Added decoding support for version 4.11 files. There have been a couple reports of them. I don't know where they came from, but they verify using the latest code. Please share if you know about the origins.

Version 10.25 (October 12, 2023)

1. Changed: Made use of a new APE\_INFO\_MD5\_MATCHES test during quick verify. This way reading the MD5 is wrapped up nicely.
2. Changed: Switched CAPEDecompress::GetInfo to a switch statement for slightly better performance.
3. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.5.

Version 10.24 (September 29, 2023)

1. NEW: Added APE\_INFO\_MD5 to the info object because a third-party developer wanted it.

Version 10.23 (September 27, 2023)

1. Fixed: 32-bit ARM could crash because it was enabling an intrinsic that was not available.

Version 10.22 (September 14, 2023)

1. Fixed: Little endian AIFF files would not encode properly.

Version 10.21 (September 14, 2023)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.4.
2. Changed: Updated the copyrights to 2024.
3. Changed: The check for AIFF / AIFC in file headers was incorrectly allowing other things to pass.

Version 10.20 (August 27, 2023)

1. Changed: Added a License.txt file by the installer that gets copied to the install path (also included in the SDK).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.2.
3. Changed: Added a license link to the help menu.
4. Changed: Changed a few variables to have APE\_ names because JRiver was having compile problems (Objective C doesn't care that things are in a namespace).

Version 10.19 (August 19, 2023)

1. NEW: Added the ability to convert tags to legacy ID3v1 in the console program (my car stereo needs this).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.1.

Version 10.18 (August 10, 2023)

1. Changed: Switched to the [three clause BSD license](license.html) to simplify inclusion of the source code.
2. Changed: Renamed some macros from MAC\_ to APE\_ since APE is a little more widely used now.
3. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.7.0 (fixed code analysis warning about directories in the last builds).
4. Changed: Updated the installer to NSIS 3.09.
5. Changed: Updated to version 2.80 of the ALAC tool.

Version 10.17 (June 29, 2023)

1. Changed: In task manager, Monkey's Audio is listed without the "windows program" footer.
2. Changed: Updated to FLAC 1.4.3.
3. Changed: Tuned the sizing of the large tag field getting a little.
4. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.6.4.

Version 10.16 (May 31, 2023)

1. Fixed: Getting a large APE tag field could return a buffer size that was too small so the next get would fail.

Version 10.15 (May 31, 2023)

1. Changed: Tuned the error handling a little more.

Version 10.14 (May 31, 2023)

1. Fixed: A corrupt frame could put the decoder into an endless loop trying the frame again which made players like Winamp, MC, etc. hang (feedback appreciated).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.6.2.

Version 10.13 (May 23, 2023)

1. Fixed: The AVX-512 code could fail to compile on some systems.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.6.1.
3. Changed: Enabled reference optimization which makes the build smaller.
4. Changed: Updated to WavPack 5.6.4.

Version 10.12 (May 19, 2023)

1. Changed: Simplified the [license agreement](license.html) to make it easier for inclusion in other projects.
2. Changed: Updated to version 2.79 of the ALAC tool.
3. Changed: The button images are created only once instead of again for the options dialog (slightly faster).
4. Changed: Winamp settings are stored in a section marked APE Plugin Settings when writing to the Winamp INI file.
5. Changed: Workaround a few NOLINT markers.
6. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.6.0.

Version 10.11 (May 4, 2023)

1. NEW: Added Shorten as another supported format for compressing and decompressing (verify is not available).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.5.5.

Version 10.10 (April 28, 2023)

1. Changed: A font is created for the list control that should better support international characters.
2. Changed: The program better supports filenames longer than MAX\_PATH (since Windows supports those too).
3. NEW: Added a Compress.bat and Decompress.bat file to the install path. It allows dragging multiple files from Explorer to process.
4. Changed: Prefixed a few macros with APE\_ to avoid collisions with other projects (ODN, ODS, MBN, etc.).
5. Fixed: Systems with AVX-512 support that had the support disabled by the OS could fail to work.

Version 10.09 (April 12, 2023)

1. Changed: Got an updated WavPack definition file from David Bryant that adds more compression modes.
2. Fixed: 32-bit floating point files did not decode nicely with Cool Edit.

Version 10.08 (April 2, 2023)

1. Fixed: When processing, if you would drag the program to a different monitor the toolbar would be created in the non-processing mode.
2. Changed: Column widths should maintain better dragging between different scaled monitors.
3. Fixed: Some files in the WAVE\_FORMAT\_EXTENSIBLE format would not start for the last few builds.

Version 10.07 (March 22, 2023)

1. Changed: Improved ARM support.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.5.3.

Version 10.06 (March 20, 2023)

1. Changed: Switched the size of the float transform to int64 to avoid overflows.

Version 10.05 (March 20, 2023)

1. Changed: Removed the no longer needed IO.cpp file.

Version 10.04 (March 20, 2023)

1. Changed: Made all processing happen when NULL is passed to GetData instead of no processing.

Version 10.03 (March 19, 2023)

1. Changed: Moved the file size check back to APEInfo for reading the whole file on quick verify.

Version 10.02 (March 19, 2023)

1. Changed: Made float processing happen when adding data to the encode stage as well.
2. Changed: Made the float flag get set when starting.

Version 10.01 (March 19, 2023)

1. Changed: Made whole file reading cap 200 MB for 32-bit and 64-bit instead of switching.
2. Changed: Made the seek function in the IO object return int instead of int64 since it's only returning error codes.

Version 10.00 (March 18, 2023)

1. NEW: Added 32-bit float compression (thanks Robert Kausch!).
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.5.2.
3. Changed: File information shows information for AIFF, SND, etc. (all the supported formats) instead of only for WAV.
4. Fixed: Converting from APE to APE would discard some of the extra information like that it should decode to AIFF, etc.
5. Fixed: CAF files with a data block that was not block aligned could have the last few bytes discarded on decode.
6. Changed: Converting the compression level of an APE file will update the file size each start since the original file is changed.
7. Changed: Updated CAPECompressCreate::Start to check the format tag of the passed wave format object.
8. Fixed: Old files could fail to decode since the addition of the faster lookup table.
9. Fixed: Extreme 32-bit files could fail to compress properly (now an overflow condition is encoded, so such files will need to be reencoded and decoded with the latest).

Version 9.20 (February 26, 2023)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.5.0.
2. Changed: Removed a couple more warning suppressions (should be transparent change, but please report any issues).
3. Fixed: Building the new Neon optimizations could fail with some versions of GCC.
4. Fixed: AVX could crash on Mac due to memory alignment.

Version 9.19 (February 22, 2023)

1. Changed: Switched the APE info and APE tag classes to derive from interfaces (avoids needing to silence a warning during export).
2. Fixed: Building without Unicode set was not working well on Windows.
3. NEW: Added support for little endian AIFF files.
4. Changed: AIFF files other than sowt or NONE for the compression are rejected.

Version 9.18 (February 17, 2023)

1. Fixed: The new functions in MACDll were not being exported properly.
2. NEW: Added a GetLibraryInterfaceVersion function to MACDll.
3. Fixed: Build problems using MinGW.

Version 9.17 (February 17, 2023)

1. Fixed: The time column was not filling for the last few versions.
2. NEW: Added GetLibraryVersionString and GetLibraryVersionNumber to MACDll.

Version 9.16 (February 16, 2023)

1. Changed: Updated CMakeLists.txt to link against shared libMAC again.

Version 9.15 (February 15, 2023)

1. Changed: Made decoding around 10% faster by using a lookup table.

Version 9.14 (February 14, 2023)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.4.5.
2. Changed: Made the file information dialog report a little better when opening on an unsupported WAV (because it's float for example).

Version 9.13 (February 13, 2023)

1. Fixed: Some platforms like Android were not building due to string functions.

Version 9.12 (February 13, 2023)

1. Fixed: The about dialog was not sizing nicely since the latest additions.
2. Fixed: AVX-512 was being incorrectly detected leading to crashes.

Version 9.11 (February 12, 2023)

1. NEW: Added AVX-512 optimizations when available.
2. Changed: Tuned some string functions for building on other platforms and other compilers.

Version 9.10 (February 3, 2023)

1. NEW: Improved and newly added optimizations (thanks Robert Kausch!):

   \* Intel SSE/AVX optimizations are now selected at runtime based on CPU capbilities.

   \* Added SSE4.1 and AVX2 optimizations for 24/32 coding.

   \* Added ARM Neon optimizations.

   \* Improved existing SSE2 and AVX2 optimizations for improved performance.

   \* General optimizations for improved performance.
2. NEW: Switched to the CMake build system for non-Windows and MinGW/MSYS builds.
3. Fixed: The console application didn't show fractional seconds for total elapsed time.
4. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.4.4.
5. Changed: Changed the casting in the prepare code so it casts as the native type once then uses that type instead of casting each use.
6. Changed: Use APE\_NULL a little more widely.
7. Changed: Switched to std::thread for processing files (instead of BeginThread).
8. Fixed: Closing the program while it was processing could leave temporary files -- now all the processes are terminated instead.
9. Changed: The temporary filenames used during processing have the thread ID in them so they're more unique.
10. Changed: When all files are OK, the message is shown and no sorting is performed (would sort, but basically shuffled).
11. Fixed: Very short files could try to read ID3v1 tags and cause problems because there wasn't enough data there.

Version 9.04 (December 11, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the SSE definition check for \_\_SSE2\_\_ outside MSVC.
2. Changed: Made APE\_NULL nullptr on all platforms instead of MSVC only.

Version 9.03 (December 10, 2022)

1. Changed: The program just assumes that every platform has SSE2 support since that has been the target for the 32-bit build for some time.
2. Changed: Switched to an integer define of the ID3 size instead of using sizeof because that warns about the data type sometimes (and just check that the size of the structure matches that size at save and load).
3. Changed: Defined a one packing size around the ID3 definition to avoid packing problems.
4. Changed: Replaced some numeric conversions with static\_cast implementations.
5. Changed: Use the define APE\_NULL a little more widely.
6. Changed: Use const on any variable that isn't changed again in MACLib (possible performance improvement).

Version 9.02 (December 4, 2022)

1. Changed: An ID3v1 tag is still checked for even if there are 128 bytes of terminating data on a modern encode since the header contains enough information. Legacy encodes still will not be able to check.
2. Changed: Updated another code path for the ID3v1 tag checking (used by third parties).
3. Changed: Verifying legacy files is a little faster because it doesn't open the decompress twice any longer.
4. Fixed: The whole file I/O object returned the wrong values on seek and could throw some pieces off.

Version 9.01 (December 3, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to FLAC 1.4.2.
2. Changed: Updated from the beta to release of TAK 2.3.3.
3. Changed: Updated to QAAC 2.77.
4. Changed: WAV files with ID3v1 tags at the end would fail to decode. Now ID3v1 tags are no longer checked for if that's the exact size of the WAV terminating data.

Version 9.00 (December 2, 2022)

1. NEW: Added support for 8-bit signed files (AU, AIFF, CAF, etc. formats).
2. Changed: Improved the AIFF parsing so it will accept a wider range of files (the code assumed the COMM chunk came first, but it did not have to).
3. NEW: Added support for AIFC files.

Version 8.99 (November 30, 2022)

1. Fixed: When decompressing an AIFF files (or other non-WAV encodes) with WavPack, the file type would always result in WAV.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.4.2.
3. Changed: Added a GetAPEFileType call to get the output file extension and no longer rename files after processing.

Version 8.98 (November 28, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to WavPack 5.6.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.4.1.
3. Changed: Made the destruction code run more completely when Winamp is closed.
4. Changed: Added some NOLINT markers because Clang warns on safe deletions sometimes.
5. Fixed: 32-bit integer files would not load properly with Cool Edit.
6. Changed: Renamed the Cool Edit filter to APE.flt (instead of CoolEdit Plugin.flt).
7. NEW: Monkey's Audio accepts a list of filenames so "Open With" will work.

Version 8.97 (November 10, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.4.0.
2. Fixed: Some 32-bit files could fail to encode properly since Monkey's Audio 8.68.
3. Changed: If a WAV file reports more data than the file size, an undefined (-1) length is used instead.

Version 8.96 (November 3, 2022)

1. Fixed: Sorting by compression was not working.
2. Fixed: Outside Windows opening an APE file with no header bytes could fail.
3. Changed: Updated the non-MSVC branch in APETag to hopefully avoid warnings with Xcode.

Version 8.95 (October 28, 2022)

1. Changed: Fresh cut because there were a few updates to 8.94 and that was causing third parties problems.

Version 8.94 (October 28, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the program throw an error if the amount of header or footer data exceeds 8 MB.
2. Changed: Switched c\_APECompress\_Finish to take int64 for the sizes of the terminating data.
3. Fixed: Compression could fail to copy the footer data properly since the addition of a CBufferIO object to allow pipes.

4. Changed: Updated the copyrights to 2023.
5. Changed: Ran Pinga on the artwork in the program to make it a little smaller (thanks Grouik).

Version 8.92 (October 7, 2022)

1. Changed: Moved that the APE namespace is being used into CPP files instead of the global header.
2. Fixed: The Console header was relying upon undefined types, now correctly includes All.h (thanks ValÃ©rian Sibille).
3. Fixed: NoWindows.h now defines TCHAR, LPTSTR, LPCTSTR outside of the APE namespace like on Windows (thanks ValÃ©rian Sibille).

Version 8.91 (October 7, 2022)

1. Changed: Worked through the rest of the Clang-Tidy warnings.
2. Changed: Turned on whole program optimization for the DirectShow filter (already on for everything else).
3. Fixed: With the non-Windows standard file reader, reads that didn't read any bytes would be reported as successful, causing FFmpeg pipes to hang forever after reaching the end of the input file (thanks ValÃ©rian Sibille).

Version 8.90 (September 29, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to a new certificate for signing that's good for three more years.
2. Changed: Use nullptr and override under MSVC.
3. Changed: Switched the CRC code to use a table defined in the code instead of running code to build the table (makes startup a little cleaner and faster).
4. Changed: Worked through some more Clang-Tidy warnings.
5. Changed: When verifying an APL file, it will slow verify in all cases since it's just a small chunk of a big file (instead of checking the big file quick).
6. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.3.5.

Version 8.81 (September 18, 2022)

1. Changed: Enabled Clang-Tidy code analysis for the other projects and worked through some more warnings.

4. Changed: Removed some of the foreign language comments from the DirectShow Filter (originally written by Igor Janos).
5. Changed: Switched a bunch of C-style casts to static\_cast to be a little more C++.
6. Changed: Enabled Clang-Tidy code analysis and worked through some warnings.

Version 8.70 (September 11, 2022)

1. NEW: Added the TAK compressor (compress, decompress, and verify) (thanks Thomas Becker).

Version 8.69 (September 10, 2022)

1. Fixed: Corrected a memory leak when Winamp got cover art.
2. Changed: The console program better accepts different length extensions when renaming the input to AIFF, W64, etc.

2. Changed: Corrected the remaining warnings.
3. Changed: Moved the wave format back to MACLib and removed the header.

Version 8.67 (September 7, 2022)

1. Changed: Restructured CreateIAPEDecompressCore to avoid a warning.
2. Changed: Updated makefile (thanks ValÃ©rian Sibille).
3. Changed: Went back to APE\_CLEAR for WAVEFORMATEX objects because the constructor was causing linking problems.
4. Changed: Added a newline to the end of all the files.

Version 8.66 (September 7, 2022)

1. Changed: Move the constructor to WAVEFORMATEX back to the header because people didn't like the dependency on MACLib.cpp.

3. Changed: Removed APESimple.cpp and just moved everything into MACLib.cpp.

Version 8.65 (September 6, 2022)

1. Changed: Cleaned up the definition of WAVEFORMATEX.
2. Changed: Moved the definition of the constructor of WAVEFORMATEX to MACLib so warning 4514 would not occur.
3. Changed: Renamed the CLEAR macro to APE\_CLEAR to avoid collisions with other projects.

Version 8.64 (September 5, 2022)

1. Changed: Switched WAVEFORMATEX to have a constructor and removed the macro calls to empty (had member initialization, but that was C++11).

Version 8.63 (September 5, 2022)

1. NEW: Added a tag removal feature to the console program. Run it with -r to remove tags.
2. Changed: Added Warnings.h to the top level Shared folder in the SDK.
3. Changed: Made the disc number field define APE\_TAG\_FIELD\_DISC simply "Disc" instead of "Disc #" to be more compatible with other tools.
4. Fixed: Robert Kausch submitted some source fixes / improvements (thanks!).
5. Changed: Removed the C++11 that slipped in (thanks Robert Kausch!).
6. Fixed: The 32-bit build could fail to encode due to an overflow (thanks Jukka Poikolainen).

Version 8.62 (August 31, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the file information dialog better report files with both APE and ID3 tags.
2. Changed: Made a definition of the wcscpy\_s function to avoid unused variable warnings outside Windows (thanks ValÃ©rian Sibille).

Version 8.61 (August 31, 2022)

1. Changed: Moved the code to get the compression level name into a shared space and reference it everywhere (instead of having a few copies).
2. Changed: When checking for tags, an APE tag is checked for even if an ID3 tag is found so both tags should be supported.
3. Changed: Moved the shared MFC functions to a common file instead of re-implementing in a couple places.

Version 8.60 (August 30, 2022)

1. NEW: Format Information is returned in the Winamp file information dialog.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.3.3.
3. Changed: The program is a little better about preserving the error codes issued during file open instead of returning a generic error.

Version 8.59 (August 30, 2022)

1. Changed: Getting and setting album art creates a new object each time instead of using the last loaded one.
2. Fixed: Winamp could fail to start playback in some cases because the file wasn't being opened with FILE\_SHARE\_WRITE access.

Version 8.58 (August 29, 2022)

1. Fixed: Winamp could error in some cases due to recent changes.

Version 8.57 (August 29, 2022)

1. NEW: Implemented the Winamp system for getting cover art (thanks David Bryant / WavPack).
2. NEW: Also added the Winamp function to remove cover art.
3. Note: The set function isn't being called, so if anyone has any hints on that [please share](contact.html).

Version 8.56 (August 26, 2022)

1. Changed: Switched to WavPack 5.5.0 from another source that avoids the virus warnings.

Version 8.55 (August 26, 2022)

1. Changed: Reverted to WavPack 5.4.0 (until 5.5.0 can stop the Virus Total warnings).

Version 8.54 (August 25, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.3.2.
2. Changed: Moved the MFC warnings to a seperate shared header file.
3. Changed: Temporarily removed the new WavPack because it's tripping up Virus Total. It can be downloaded separately on the download page.

Version 8.53 (August 22, 2022)

1. Fixed: The make file needed to be updated for the IO changes.

Version 8.52 (August 21, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.3.1.
2. Changed: Got rid of the warning suppression 4464 and instead just define the MACLib project as an include path.
3. Changed: Removed the ShowFileInfoDialog function from MACDll since Winamp now uses the stock dialog and the main program has its own dialogs.
4. Changed: Added a few more fields to the APE file information dialog of the main program.
5. Changed: Found that the Windows include suppressed warning 4514 so worked through that warning as well after turning it back on.

Version 8.51 (August 14, 2022)

1. Changed: For clarity flipped the naming in the code around so there is interim mode and normal mode (interim was used for a short while accidentally).

Version 8.50 (August 14, 2022)

1. Changed: The encoder uses what was previously "legacy mode" for all 24-bit encodings. This provides wider compatibility with only slightly worse compression.
2. Changed: Switched the limit for whole file reading during a verify to 500 MB for the 64-bit builds (still 100 MB for the 32-bit).

Version 8.43 (August 11, 2022)

1. Fixed: The console output saying compressing would not always show the compression mode string properly outside Windows.
2. Fixed: WAVE\_FORMAT\_EXTENSIBLE files would not compress in some cases.

Version 8.42 (August 10, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.3.0.
2. Changed: Define NOMINMAX so Windows won't add min / max macros to avoid accidental usage instead of ape\_min / ape\_max (which breaks cross-building).
3. Changed: Reenabled warning 4710 and worked around it (now MSVC uses the function used earlier for number to string conversion, etc.).
4. Changed: Added a size\_t cast to remove the final couple warnings about possible overflows.

Version 8.41 (July 31, 2022)

1. Changed: Switched to the stock Winamp file information dialog instead of showing a custom one.
2. Changed: Set a timer for three seconds after Winamp queries for file information to unload the file (since Winamp doesn't provide a finished function call).

Version 8.40 (July 30, 2022)

1. Fixed: Seeking to the end of files was broken in build 39.

Version 8.39 (July 30, 2022)

1. Fixed: Setting the EOF wasn't working nicely in a whole file reader.
2. Changed: Switched from = { 0 } to a memset to initialize arrays and other objects.
3. Changed: Introduced a CLEAR macro for emptying an object to make the code cleaner.
4. Fixed: Seeking to the end of the file could fail in some cases due to sign flipping.

Version 8.38 (July 29, 2022)

1. Changed: Added construction to wave format extended object and removed the memsets.

Version 8.37 (July 29, 2022)

1. Fixed: The versions embedded in the program were not current (because of changes a while ago).

Version 8.36 (July 28, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the whole file and buffer I/O objects independent classes so they can work with the Windows or non-Windows I/O objects.
2. Changed: Switched from a memset to zero to setting individual variables to avoid problems over smart pointers.
3. Changed: Switched to next byte packing and removed all the paddings added to avoid warning 4820.
4. Fixed: Corrected a few mixtures of signed and unsigned numbers.

Version 8.35 (July 25, 2022)

1. Fixed: Creating ID3 tags could fail on the year field because it incorrectly left room for a NULL terminator.

Version 8.34 (July 25, 2022)

1. Changed: Removed the suppression of warning 4774 and just output strings in a slightly different way.
2. Changed: Switched back to sprintf\_s because \_itoa\_s wasn't available outside Windows.
3. Fixed: Corrected a couple casting things to work better outside Windows.

Version 8.33 (July 24, 2022)

1. Changed: A little more warning tuning because warning 4710 was coming through in debug x64 for example.

Version 8.32 (July 23, 2022)

1. Changed: Switched to \_itoa\_s in APETag so that warning 4710 could be brought back.

Version 8.31 (July 23, 2022)

1. Changed: Removed the no inline for standard C functions to avoid compile problems in other programs that include Monkey's Audio (and just suppressed the warning).

Version 8.30 (July 23, 2022)

1. Changed: Turned on all compiler warnings (instead of level 4) and worked through many and disabled a few.
2. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.2.6.

Version 8.20 (July 11, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to WavPack 5.5.0.

Version 8.19 (June 25, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.2.5.
2. Changed: Removed the uninstaller from the SDK (since it was removed from the program a while ago).

Version 8.18 (June 15, 2022)

1. Changed: Adjusted the borders of the frames in options.
2. Changed: Made OK and Cancel in Options a little taller.
3. Changed: Moved options icons up a little.
4. Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 17.2.4.

Version 8.17 (June 13, 2022)

1. Changed: Set the tab order in all the dialogs again.
2. Changed: The options dialog sizes width based on the DPI setting insted of using a width stored in the resource.

Version 8.16 (June 12, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the options list a little wider to avoid truncation on high DPI.
2. Changed: Made output directory level recreation a combobox instead of an edit (since only a few values would be chosen, it seemed unnecessary to allow typing).
3. Changed: Put the browse directory button right next to the path selection in options instead of below it.
4. Changed: Put the APL naming help button back to the right of the combobox in Options.

Version 8.15 (June 12, 2022)

1. Fixed: There was no height for the drop lists in the comboboxes in Options.

Version 8.14 (June 12, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the options dialog totally build on the fly so any scale setting should work.
2. Changed: Tuned Options to look a little better at 3.0x scale.

Version 8.13 (June 10, 2022)

1. Changed: A:\ and B:\ are available as drives on right-click of the free space box (was starting at C:\).
2. Changed: Added the scale to the about box.

Version 8.12 (June 7, 2022)

1. Changed: When the statusbar switches to the processing state, it is auto-sized again.
2. Changed: Switched to the release Visual Studio (17.2.3) from the preview.

Version 8.11 (June 6, 2022)

1. Changed: The statusbar grows as necessary to hold text (and just squishes the progress bar).

Version 8.10 (June 6, 2022)

1. Changed: Tuned the options dialog a little more for high DPI screens.
2. Changed: Worked on the file information dialogs for high DPI screens.

Version 8.09 (June 6, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the about box scale in both directions for the DPI.

Version 8.08 (June 6, 2022)

1. Changed: Tuned the statusbar sizes to hold the text a little better on high DPI.

Version 8.07

1. Fixed: At 2x (or more) scale the about box would be cropped.

Version 8.06

1. Fixed: The font could grow over and over sizing between low and high DPI because the original wasn't stored.
2. Changed: The scale is loaded on WM\_DPICHANGED instead of during size of the window.

Version 8.05

1. Fixed: When Windows doesn't have the new DPI calls, the program nicely defaults to a scale of 1.0 (the call requires Windows 10).
2. Changed: The high DPI font is set in the file information dialogs as well.
3. Fixed: The file list was not saving between runs.

Version 8.04

1. Changed: Options should look good up to a 2.0 scale and the high DPI monitor I have is 1.5.

Version 8.03

1. Fixed: Moving the window between different DPIs while processing could crash as the statusbar was rebuilt.
2. Changed: Resized the options dialog a little to put items below the text labels instead of to the right.

Version 8.02

1. Changed: Set the font size in the options dialog to account for high DPI.

Version 8.01

1. Changed: The program reports itself as DPI aware and does all the DPI scaling independently (instead of leaning on the OS). It should rescale dragging between monitors of different DPI ([feedback](contact.html) appreciated).

Version 7.81 (June 3, 2022)

1. Fixed: When decoding a file that needed to build the WAV header, the format flag could be incorrect.

Version 7.80 (June 1, 2022)

1. Changed: Enabled warning 4840 and worked through the warnings.
2. Changed: Removed the little uninstall launcher and just call the main program with a switch instead.
3. Fixed: The uninstall icon was not showing the Monkey's Audio icon.

Version 7.79 (May 30, 2022)

1. Changed: Removed the unused read-only flag from CreateIAPEDecompressEx and CreateIAPEDecompressEx2 functions since they didn't do anything (still there for CreateIAPEDecompress).
2. Changed: A little more clean-up of the removal of 4127 warnings.
3. Changed: Found a define for the buffer size passed by the Winamp GetFileInformation(...) call so a safe string copy can be used.
4. Changed: Sniffed the buffer size of FilterOptionsString with my copy of Cool Edit and used that for the string copy size instead of suppressing a warning and having no cap.

Version 7.78 (May 29, 2022)

1. Changed: Removed MMX assembly since it was only used by legacy decoding for 32-bit compiles and modern CPUs have better.
2. Changed: Turned on warning 4100 and worked through the warnings.

Version 7.77 (May 29, 2022)

1. Changed: Suppressed a few more warning level 4 Direct Show SDK warnings.
2. Changed: Switched all the projects to full link time code generation to make pieces possibly faster.
3. Changed: The taskbar icon progress interface is released when processing finishes so the taskbar icon will return to the not processing state.
4. Changed: A little different approach to get around 4127 warnings about the bitdepth size in NNFilter.

Version 7.76 (May 26, 2022)

1. Changed: Visual Studio update.
2. Changed: Tried to work around 4127 warnings about testing the size of the integer type.

Version 7.75 (May 20, 2022)

1. Changed: A little faster WAVE\_FORMAT\_EXTENSIBLE check (no longer copies memory).
2. Changed: Removed the register keyword from the legacy decoder since it's no longer supported by the modern compiler.
3. Changed: Removed the seek to the start of the file right after opening because it shouldn't be necessary.
4. Changed: Initialized a few more variables and removed suppression of a warning about variable initialization.

Version 7.74 (May 12, 2022)

1. Changed: Switched the definition of GUID so it will build on other platforms.
2. Changed: Updated to a little better structure for the WAVE\_FORMAT\_EXTENSIBLE data block.

Version 7.73 (May 11, 2022)

1. Changed: Switched the number of blocks to int64 so it will never overflow.
2. Changed: Removed mulaw and alaw support since playback would not be correct.
3. Changed: When parsing a WAVE\_FORMAT\_EXTENSIBLE file, the encoder will make sure it is PCM type otherwise reject it (so floating files no longer encode).

Version 7.72 (May 11, 2022)

1. Changed: WAV files that report an odd bits per sample but whole byte alignment (ie. 12 bit / 16 bit align) will work.
2. Changed: Enabled Insane compression for 32-bit files (disabled in the past because it wasn't working, but seems to be now).

Version 7.71 (May 11, 2022)

1. NEW: Added support for mulaw and alaw encoded files (compression might not be great).

Version 7.70 (May 11, 2022)

1. NEW: Added support for 8-bit CAF files.
2. NEW: Added support for 8-bit AIFF files.
3. Changed: The command line defaults to quick verify now and can do a full verify by specifying -V (note the capitalization).

Version 7.69 (May 10, 2022)

1. Fixed: Made WAV files with sizes that were not divisible by the block size round down to the nearest block instead of error.
2. Fixed: Too large files could overflow the number of audio blocks (switched from signed to unsigned to support double the number of blocks).

Version 7.68 (May 10, 2022)

1. Changed: Visual Studio update.
2. Changed: Made it a little more clear that MACDll links to MFC in the project settings.
3. Changed: Removed a testing piece of code added last build.

Version 7.67 (May 5, 2022)

1. Changed: Use the MFC functions to get the module handle instead of being tied to the DLL name (so 32 vs 64 bit no longer matters).

Version 7.66 (May 5, 2022)

1. Fixed: The information dialogs in MACDll didn't show in the 64-bit version since the DLL was renamed.

Version 7.65 (May 5, 2022)

1. Fixed: A resource file got changed in a bad way due to the Cool Edit change.

Version 7.64 (May 5, 2022)

1. Changed: Visual Studio update.
2. Fixed: Corrected a couple warnings that crept back in to the compilation.

Version 7.62 (April 22, 2022)

1. Fixed: The FLAC version reported in the APX file was lagging the actual version.
2. Changed: Artwork is loaded from the program path first, then the install path. This way copying the program files to an external location will work.

Version 7.61 (April 19, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the list background image transparent background intead of white.
2. Fixed: Drag from the program could assert, so trying a little different approach.
3. Changed: Visual Studio update.

Version 7.60 (April 17, 2022)

1. Changed: Art is loaded from the install path so running the code out of the SDK will find the art without doing any other work.

Version 7.59 (April 12, 2022)

1. Changed: Did a little more work on setting the end of file with reading the whole file on so the end is actually set.
2. Changed: Included the uninstaller (little launcher that starts the uninstaller) in the SDK.
3. Changed: Updated to FLAC 1.3.4 for the external install.
4. Changed: Updated the version of QAAC to 2.73 (used for ALAC).
5. Changed: Made a "Custom" FLAC encode mode to allow specifying a custom command (ie. -3).
6. Changed: The Winamp plugin install is removed from the install path so that it won't flag virus checkers (with the false positive).
7. Changed: Visual Studio update.

Version 7.58 (April 9, 2022)

1. Changed: Moved the Winamp plugin install into the main install (if the directory is found) because online virus checkers were throwing false positives.
2. Fixed: When reading the whole file using the decoder, tagging could hang as it tried to remove the tags over and over.
3. Changed: APE tags are capped at 256 MB (previously they had a smaller cap in some cases).

Version 7.57 (April 7, 2022)

1. Changed: Versioned the DirectShow filter to match the program (although Windows doesn't show .ax versions).
2. Changed: Moved the DirectX code into a subfolder for the DirectShow filter (source SDK change).
3. Changed: Visual Studio update.

Version 7.56 (April 1, 2022)

1. Changed: Visual Studio update.
2. Changed: Moved the DirectX code into the DirectShow filter so there's no need for an external library.

Version 7.55 (March 31, 2022)

1. Changed: Added the main program to the SDK so any help or feedback appreciated (MAC).

Version 7.54 (March 27, 2022)

1. Changed: Updated Visual Studio (release version instead of preview version).

Version 7.53 (March 23, 2022)

1. Changed: Doing a quick verify will show progress as it reads the file and allow cancel (remember that read is one call on files less than 100MB so it won't be real fine in those cases).

Version 7.52 (March 22, 2022)

1. Changed: Cleaned up a variable used to build the RF64 headers.
2. Changed: The program won't start if another instance is running already, but instead just shows the first instance.

Version 7.51 (March 17, 2022)

1. Changed: Files over 4 GB are decoded to RF64 WAV files when building a header instead of simple WAV files so the length can be better represented (no change if a WAV with a header was encoded, or a WAV less than 4 GB is decoded).
2. Changed: Visual Studio update.

Version 7.50 (March 13, 2022)

1. Changed: Encoding no longer caps the input at 4 GB. Any size should be supported.
2. Changed: Switched MAX\_AUDIO\_BYTES\_UNKNOWN to -1 instead of the maximum integer value (hopefully internal change, but please report any problems).

Version 7.41 (March 12, 2022)

1. NEW: Added support for RF64 input files (similar to RIFF WAV files).

Version 7.40 (March 12, 2022)

1. NEW: Added support for core audio format (CAF) files.
2. Changed: Consolidated some header and footer code into a shared base class (should be internal change, but please report any issues).

Version 7.38 (March 3, 2022)

1. Fixed: LEGACY\_ENCODE was improperly engaging on 32-bit encoding.

Version 7.37 (February 25, 2022)

1. Fixed: LEGACY\_ENCODE wasn't working properly in all cases.

Version 7.36 (February 25, 2022)

1. Changed: Added a LEGACY\_ENCODE switch to the header to allow encoding in the older style for uses like FFMpeg that haven't updated their decoders.

Version 7.35 (February 23, 2022)

1. Changed: Made the help shortcut in the start menu link to the webpage instead of the old help file.
2. Changed: Removed the old help files during install.
3. Changed: MACDll.dll in the 64-bit install is copied into both the 32-bit and 64-bit system folders (the proper version).
4. Changed: Renamed the MACDll in the 64-bit build MACDll64 (like the Direct Show filter).

Version 7.29 (February 6, 2022)

1. NEW: Added an edit box to the browse folder dialog so you can type in a folder.

Version 7.28 (February 6, 2022)

1. Changed: There was no need to append the current path when piping from Foobar so it has been removed from the console.

Version 7.15 (November 13, 2021)

1. Changed: Some changes in GlobalFunctions.cpp to work better on Android and ARM/ARM64 (thanks Dmitry Kostjuchenko).

Version 7.14 (October 25, 2021)

1. Changed: Revised the naming of the endian stuff to avoid conflicts with Android.
2. Changed: Included faster CRC code for ARMv8 (64-bit ARM) chips.

Version 7.13 (October 12, 2021)

1. Fixed: The start menu path was not being loaded properly on uninstall so it could delete nothing or more than it should instead.

1. Changed: More sign simplification thanks to Dmitry Kostjuchenko for a little faster processing.

Version 7.11 (October 8, 2021)

1. Fixed: A quick verify glitch in 7.06.

Version 7.06 (September 24, 2021)

1. Fixed: The check for 4 GB was checking the whole WAV file size instead of just the data block size.
2. Fixed: Really big files could have the size of the APE chunk wrong in the header so they would fail a quick verify (but still decompress).

Version 7.05 (September 23, 2021)

1. Changed: Made quick verify read the entire file in one call if it's smaller than 100 MB as it seems to make verifying a batch of files at the same time faster.

Version 3.86 beta 1

1. Changed: Rewrote the bitstream functions. It's the first time the bitstream has changed formats since the 1.xx's. Bitstream encoding is now quite a bit faster, and it achieves slightly better compression.
2. Changed: Added file-type masking to the drag-n-drop, add files, add folder, context menus, and mode switching. Very convenient, but my head hurts.
3. Changed: MAC will now give an error if you attempt to do something with an external encoder that you don't have. (instead of piecing out)

2. Changed: 8-bit files should now compress about 1% or so better

Version 3.83 beta

1. New: New 'extra high' mode... beefed up from the previous version... even better compression, but a bit slower
2. New: Added detection of 'pure' silence, so now pure silence takes basically no space.
3. New: Added fake-stereo detection (mono split to stereo) for improved compression on these tracks (common on CD's made from old mono recordings)
4. New: Added CPU load-balancing mechanism for the playback of 'extra high' files to keep CPU usage more even.

4. New: On-the-fly conversion of your APE files... now it's a lot faster to upgrade your collection to the newest version
5. New: Convert now skips the file if you're going from APE->APE and the version and compression levels match (add your whole music folder, do a 'Convert', and it'll only convert the stuff it has to)
6. New: Added several keyboard shortcuts to make using Monkey's Audio a little easier
7. New: Improved error reporting (no more numbers :)
8. New: Can now order the file list by dragging items around

20. New: APE files now work fine when tagged with ID3v2 tags
21. Fixed: Fixed a bug causing 24-bit files to not play properly from Winamp when "Scaling" was turned on
22. New: Added Media Jukebox information loading/saving functions to the Winamp plugin... makes Media Jukebox work with APE files quite a bit nicer
23. Changed: A few little speed tweaks... (it's getting harder and harder to find places that I can speed up...)
24. Changed: Seek information stored more efficiently now... files will be a few kb smaller, and error recovery/patching will be much easier
25. Fixed: Learned how to spell "success" :)

Version 3.80

1. Changed: Complete remake of the 'extra high' mode... tons better compression and a lot of MMX assembly for speed :)
2. Changed: Some fairly substantial speed/compression improvements to 'normal' and 'high' as well
3. New: Winamp plugin can now optionally suppress long passages of silence

2. New: http:// streaming support... would be better, but it's hard to tune with a 56k modem ;)
3. New: support for Media Jukebox server format... (I would say more, but it's still top secret...just trust me, it's pretty cool)
4. Changed: Monkey's Audio now remains totally responsive while acting as a front-end for other coders; also, new pop-up windows will be minimized if Monkey's Audio is minimized

6. Changed: An even better 'High' mode
7. Changed: Shell extensions should now work with basically any program (Winamp, Media Jukebox, etc.)
8. Fixed: No longer prompts to install Winamp plugin on first run (since setup should take care of this)
