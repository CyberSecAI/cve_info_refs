The provided content discusses issues with the Cisco ASA's Real Time Log Viewer in ASDM, specifically its tendency to stop displaying logs. This issue is related to two Cisco bugs: CSCsm11264 and CSCtb92911, which are triggered by specific syslog messages when URL filtering or HTTP inspection is enabled.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is related to the ASA's handling of syslog messages, specifically messages 304001-304005 related to URL access, when HTTP inspection or URL filtering is enabled. When these logs are generated with long URL strings, it causes the Real-Time Log Viewer in ASDM to stop refreshing/displaying new messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The ASA's syslog handling mechanism has a flaw that causes the Real Time Log Viewer to become unresponsive when processing certain log messages (304001-304005), especially when long URL strings are present.
- The issue is triggered specifically with ASA versions 8.x configured with HTTP inspection or URL filtering with an external server.
- The problem also occurs if netflow is enabled and "Disable redundant syslog messages" checkbox is checked, which avoids sending log messages via both syslog and netflow, causing the log viewer to stop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the loss of real-time log visibility within the ASDM interface, hindering troubleshooting, monitoring, and security analysis.
- The log viewer becomes unresponsive, requiring the user to close and reopen ASDM to restore temporary functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- There isn't a direct 'attack vector' in the conventional sense, as the vulnerability isn't actively exploited. Instead, it's triggered by normal operation of the firewall when logging specific syslog messages related to web traffic. However, an attacker could potentially trigger the bug through actions that generate long URLs (e.g., requesting web pages with very long URL parameters).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker doesn't need specific capabilities or position to trigger the problem. The issue manifests due to the interaction between specific ASA configuration and log generation.  Any user activity that generates the problematic syslog messages (304001-304005), such as visiting web pages or using applications that generate HTTP traffic, can trigger the bug. A large amount of these log messages can make the viewer unresponsive.

**Additional details:**
- The problem is specific to ASA versions 8.x and ASDM versions 6.x.
- Workarounds include disabling specific syslog messages (304001-304005), or unchecking "Disable redundant syslog messages" when netflow is enabled.
- Fixed versions were later released (8.2(1.12) and 8.2(2)).
