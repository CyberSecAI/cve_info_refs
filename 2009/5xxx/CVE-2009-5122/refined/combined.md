Key features in this release

Websense Email Security version 7.2 includes such functional enhancements as
support for Windows Server 2008 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008. This release also
contains the new features described in this section. For information on all Websense
Email Security features, see the Websense Email Security Help menu, or the
Websense Email Security Administrator Help.

Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 support

If your operating system is Windows Server 2008 or your database uses SQL Server
2008, you need to modify some system settings for Websense Email Security to run
properly.

File sharing

Windows Server 2008 supports 2 types of file sharing: public file sharing and standard
file sharing. You must enable standard file sharing and network discovery for
Websense Email Security to function properly in a cluster configuration running
Windows Server 2008.

You can enable file sharing and network discovery in the Windows Network and
Sharing Center as follows:

1. Navigate to the Network and Sharing Center window, which lists file sharing

options (Start > Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center).

2.

3.

In the Sharing and Discovery section, click the down arrow to the right of the File
sharing option and choose to enable standard file sharing.

In the Sharing and Discovery section, click the down arrow to the right of the
Network discovery option and choose to enable network discovery.

SQL Server passwords

Password requirements under Windows Server 2008 are more complex than those for
earlier versions. If you are running Windows Server 2008, the password must

(cid:1) Not contain the user’s account name or parts of the user’s full name that exceed

two consecutive characters

(cid:1) Be at least six characters in length

(cid:1) Contain characters from three of the following four categories:

(cid:2) Uppercase characters (A – Z)

(cid:2)

Lowercase characters (a – z)

(cid:2) Digits (0 – 9)

(cid:2)

Special keyboard characters (for example, !, $, #, %, @)

If you use SQL Server versions prior to 2008 with Windows Server 2008, SQL Server
passwords must adhere to these guidelines.

SQL Server connection

Security features in Windows Server 2008 require additional settings for local and
remote connection to SQL Server 2008.

For a connection to a local instance of SQL Server 2008, you must add localhost to
your Internet trusted sites:

1. Open the Internet Options dialog box (Tools > Internet Options) and select the

Security tab.

2. Select the Trusted Sites zone and click Sites.

3. Add http://localhost in the Trusted sites dialog box.

4. Click Add and then Close.

5. Click OK.

In addition to making localhost a trusted Internet site, you must modify settings in the
SQL Server Configuration Manager for a connection to a remote SQL Server 2008, as
follows:

1. Open the SQL Server Configuration Manager from the Start menu (Start > All
Programs > Microsoft SQL Server 2008 > SQL Server Configuration
Manager). You can also right-click My Computer and select Manage. In
Computer Management, expand Services and Applications.

2. Expand SQL Server Configuration Manager.

3. Expand SQL Server Network Configuration and select Client Protocols.

4.

In the list of protocols, right-click the TCP/IP protocol and then click Enable.

5. Right-click the Named Pipes protocol and then click Enable.

You also need to add security policies to allow a remote connection to SQL Server
2008. See “SQL Server behind a firewall,” in the Websense Email Security
Installation Guide for more information.

Encryption gateway rule

A new predefined encryption gateway rule can redirect email to a specified Smart
Host server for encryption. When Websense Email Security detects an email message
that meets the criteria you specify for encryption, this rule is triggered. The encryption
server encrypts the redirected email and sends it to its destination.

Message search only option in Message Administrator

You can now set up Websense Email Security user accounts that include permission to
release messages via a message search in the Message Administrator without the
permission to view message content. A new Message Search Only option is included
in the Message Search function of Message Administrator.

Zero-Hour Protection function renamed

The Zero-Hour Protection component of the Anti-Virus Malware Scanning rule object
is renamed to Websense Internet Threat Database Real-Time Protection. This
component continues to protect your system from emerging outbreaks of email-borne
viruses contained in URL links. It determines potential threats based on real-time
URL categorization.

Proxy information edit

You can change the proxy server user name and password that you entered in the
Configuration Wizard at product installation. Select the Monitor Tools > Options to
edit the user name and password.

Personal Email Manager and Report Central

Websense Email Security version 7.2 is compatible with:

(cid:1)

Personal Email Manager version 7.2

All Personal Email Manager features are supported.

(cid:1) Report Central version 2.7.2

Status information for Report Central version 2.7.2 appears on the Dashboard in
Websense Email Security. No Report Central status information appears on the
Dashboard if you integrate with a Report Central version earlier than 2.7.2.

Personal Email Manager

Personal Email Manager version 7.2 is now supported on Windows Server 2008.  This
end-user component also allows users to specify a SQL Server instance name during
product installation. The instance name can be entered along with the port information
in the SQL Server Connection Details dialog box.

It is possible to change Personal Email Manager and Websense Email Security
database server information after product installation via the Personal Email Manager
Configuration Tool.

To change server database information:

Open the Personal Email Manager Configuration Tool (Start > Programs [or All
Programs] > Personal Email Manager > Configuration Tool).

1. Click the PEM Database button or the WES Database button, depending on

which database configuration you want to modify.

2.

In the resulting dialog box, edit any database server information that you want to
change, including

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

the name or IP address of the database server

the server’s TCP port number

the method of authentication. If SQL authentication is used, enter the server
login details.

Test your connection by clicking the Test button in the dialog box.

Report Central

This version of Report Central is now supported on Windows Server 2008. This
component also includes a new predefined standard report. The Top N Viruses report
is a traffic-based management report that can be displayed either as a horizontal bar
chart or a table. This report provides the name and frequency of each virus detected
based on defined date and time criteria.

Tips for upgrading from prior versions

Complete upgrade instructions are included in the Websense Email Security
Installation Guide.

Direct upgrade is supported for the following products:

(cid:1) Websense Email Security version 7.0 (with any hotfixes applied)

(cid:1) Websense Email Security version 7.1 (with any hotfixes applied)

Users of Websense Email Security version 6.1 and earlier must first upgrade to
Websense Email Security version 7.0 before installing version 7.2.

Client upgrades are not supported. Please uninstall the existing version of the client
application and install the latest version. A subscription key is not required for client
installation.

Subscription keys

The multiple-key subscription model used for Websense Email Security version 6.1
Service Pack 1 and earlier was replaced with a single-key subscription model in
version 7.0. Your subscription key enables email filtering and several ThreatSeeker
technologies, including:

(cid:1) Anti-Spam Agent

(cid:1) Virtual Learning Agent

(cid:1) Anti-Virus Malware Scanning

(cid:1)

Internet Threat Database

Optionally, you can extend your subscription to include:

(cid:1) Anti-Virus Agent

(cid:1) Virtual Image Agent

If you are upgrading from version 6.1 or earlier, you must have a new subscription key
before initiating the upgrade process. During the upgrade, you will be prompted for
the new key. To order a new key, log on to MyWebsense.

Existing SurfControl keys will continue to function for 60 days after you obtain the
new Websense subscription key.

If you are upgrading from version 7.0 or later, you are not prompted for a new key.

STEMLog database rebuild

If you are upgrading from version 7.0 or earlier, the installation process includes a step
to rebuild your STEMLog database. The rebuild process can result in improved
performance of database management activities, as well as Message Administrator
search message and query functions. Please note that a significant amount of
downtime is required for the rebuild process. For example, rebuilding a 24-GB
database may take 2 hours or more.

We strongly recommend that you back up your current STEMLog database before you
install version 7.2.

If you have already rebuilt the STEMLog database in conjunction with upgrades to
Websense Email Security version 7.0 or version 6.1, Service Pack 1, Hotfix 6, the
installation process detects that your database has been modified and does not run the
rebuild process again.

Duplicate alerts

The Dashboard alert system monitors and responds to more than 30 vital system
conditions, including the accumulation of messages in the drop-off and pick-up
folders. Separate monitoring and reporting are still supported via Receive Service,
Rules Service, and Send Service configuration. If you plan to use the Dashboard alert
system, you may want to turn off these redundant alerts. In the Server Configuration
console, review the Enable Administrator alerts settings for:

(cid:1) Receive Service general setting - monitors the received mail drop-off folder (In

folder)

(cid:1) Rules Service general settings - monitors the processed mail drop-off folder (Out

folder)

(cid:1)

Send Service general settings - monitors the mail pick-up folder (Out folder)

Internet Threat Database update tasks

As of version 7.0, the ThreatSeeker Internet Threat Database replaced the threat
database from earlier versions of Websense Email Security. As part of the upgrade
process from version 6.1 or earlier, the installer deletes existing “Internet Threat
Database Update” Scheduler tasks, and creates two new tasks:

(cid:1) Master Internet Threat Database update: runs daily at 00:30

(cid:1) Real-time Internet Threat Database update: runs every 30 minutes, every day

If you are upgrading from version 6.1 or earlier, you may need to modify some
scheduled tasks. To change the default schedule or create or delete a task, open the
Scheduler.

To change the settings of an existing task, double-click on the task, make the desired
changes, and click OK. For more information, see “Scheduling Internet Threat
Database updates” in Administrator Help.

New Authentium Anti-Virus configuration options

In version 7.1, the Authentium Anti-Virus engine in the Anti-Virus Malware Scanning
object was upgraded to the version 5.1.3 Authentium engine. As a result, the
Authentium (Command Antivirus) configuration options may have changed. If you
are upgrading from version 6.1 or earlier and after the upgrade process is complete,
you should open any rules that use Authentium (by default: “Anti-Virus Malware
Scanning - Isolate messages that contain a Virus or Malware”), open the AVMS object
in the rule, select Authentium from the Virus scanners list, click Configure, and
select the desired options. See “Configuring the Anti-Virus Malware Scanning object”
in Administrator Help.

Anti-Virus scanning

For superior discovery of email-borne viruses, it is highly recommended that you use
the default Anti-Virus Malware Scanning (AVMS) rule. AVMS uses two highly
regarded third-party virus scanners, McAfee and Authentium.

If your organization requires use of another third-party scanner, please see the list of
supported scanners below. For configuration information, see “Third-Party Virus
Scanning object” in Administrator Help.

Release Notes additions

This section provides information about Websense Email Security v7.2 issues that
became known after the product’s release. Both issues involve the Configuration
Wizard starting Websense Email Security services before database downloads are
completed.

Unexpected error message during configuration

During Websense Email Security configuration, the following pop-up message may
appear while the database download manager is running:

Failed to extract the compressed database file. The database
file might be used by Websense Email Security services.
Do you want to stop Websense Email Security Services?

This message appears because the Websense Email Security services start before the
download manager completes its downloads. The Rules Service must be stopped for
the proper extraction of the McAfee anti-virus database.

Click Yes in the pop-up window to stop the services and extract the McAfee database.

The Websense Email Security Configuration Wizard will restart the services.

Configuration Wizard timeout

During Websense Email Security v7.2 installation, the Configuration Wizard may
experience the following timeout error while starting Websense Email Security
services:

Error: Cannot start service: [service name]: This operation
returned because the timeout period expired.

The Configuration Wizard starts Websense Email Security services before the
database download manager completes its downloads.

This timeout error may occur after the Anti-Virus Agent and Anti-Spam Agent have
been downloaded. The Internet Threat Database may still be downloading.

Click Retry in the Configuration Wizard window for the wizard to start the services.
