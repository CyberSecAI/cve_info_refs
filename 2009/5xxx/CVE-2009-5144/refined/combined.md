Subject: libapache2-mod-gnutls: GnuTLSClientVerify require is ignored.
Date: Wed, 21 Apr 2010 18:05:58 +0200
```
Package: libapache2-mod-gnutls
Version: 0.5.6-1
Severity: normal

This is a known bug, a patch exists at the author's issue-tracking system: <http://issues.outoforder.cc/view.php?id=93>

Quoting from this source: "Despite having set "GnuTLSClientVerify require" in my Apache config, the server doesn't request client certificates from the browser, but lets it in without certificates."

AFAIK version 0.5.1 (lenny) is also affected.

```
```
Package: libapache2-mod-gnutls
Version: 0.5.10-1.1
Followup-For: Bug #578663

This bug still exists in current stable and unstable packages. I have
analyzed the problem and found that the authentication hook
(mgs_hook_authz) failed to consider the server's client verify mode,
even if the verify mode was unset in the directory configuration. As a
result, invalid certificates were ignored and clients could connect and
receive data as long as they presented any certificate whatsoever. The
logs show that the certificate was recognized as invalid, but the
request is still served.

[debug] gnutls_hooks.c(1181): [client 127.0.0.1] GnuTLS: A Chain of 1
certificate(s) was provided for validation
[debug] gnutls_hooks.c(1236): [client 127.0.0.1] GnuTLS: Verifying list
of  1 certificate(s)
[info] [client 127.0.0.1] GnuTLS: Could not find Signer for Peer Certificate
[info] [client 127.0.0.1] GnuTLS: Peer Certificate is invalid.

The attached patch applies to the version in stable, commit
5a8a32bbfb8a83fe6358c5c31c443325a7775fc2 in my git repository [1] should
work for the unstable version. Functionally, they are identical, but
apparently indentation changed between the two versions.

Since this bug makes required TLS client auth effectively worthless, I
consider it a security issue.

Subject: squeeze update of mod-gnutls?
Date: Tue, 24 Feb 2015 18:10:46 +0100
```
Hello dear maintainer(s),

the Debian LTS team would like to fix the security issues which are
currently open in the Squeeze version of mod-gnutls:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/mod-gnutls>

Would you like to take care of this yourself? We are still understaffed so
any help is always highly appreciated.

If yes, please follow the workflow we have defined here:
<http://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development>

If that workflow is a burden to you, feel free to just prepare an
updated source package and send it to debian-lts@lists.debian.org
(via a debdiff, or with an URL pointing to the the source package,
or even with a pointer to your packaging repository), and the members
of the LTS team will take care of the rest. Indicate clearly whether you
have tested the updated package or not.

If you don't want to take care of this update, it's not a problem, we
will do our best with your package. Just let us know whether you would
like to review and/or test the updated package before it gets released.

Thank you very much.

Raphaël Hertzog,
  on behalf of the Debian LTS team.

PS: A member of the LTS team might start working on this update at
any point in time. You can verify whether someone is registered
on this update in this file:
