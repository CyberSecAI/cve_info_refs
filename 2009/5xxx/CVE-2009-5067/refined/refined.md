Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-5067:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `html2ps` handles Server Side Include (SSI) directives. Specifically, the `include` directive within SSI allows the inclusion of files. The vulnerability arises because `html2ps` did not properly validate the file paths provided in these `include` directives, allowing directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the lack of proper path validation in the SSI `include` directive.
- **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can use directory traversal sequences like `../` within the `file` attribute of the `include` directive to navigate the filesystem and access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The software lacks sufficient checks on the input file paths provided via SSI directives.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of sensitive files on the server, which may contain confidential data, source code, credentials, or system information. This can have severe consequences, potentially leading to further attacks or loss of data.
- **Information Leakage:**  Exposure of system configuration files could provide an attacker with additional information useful for further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML file that contains SSI `include` directives with directory traversal sequences within the `file` attribute.
- If a web application uses `html2ps` as a CGI script to convert HTML to PostScript, and allows users to upload HTML content for conversion, the vulnerability can be exploited.
- The vulnerable `html2ps` program is not intended to be directly exposed to the internet, thus the vulnerability relies on the presence of a web server running the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to upload or provide malicious HTML:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious HTML file containing crafted SSI directives to the vulnerable service. This could be achieved through a file upload function in a web application that uses `html2ps` or by otherwise providing this input to the `html2ps` program.
- **Knowledge of server-side setup (optional):** While not strictly necessary, knowledge of the server's file system structure could help an attacker target specific files more effectively. However, a generic attack can attempt to read common files like `/etc/passwd`.
- **Access to the vulnerable web service:** The attacker needs to have access to a web service that is using the vulnerable `html2ps` application for HTML to PostScript conversion.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was initially addressed by disabling SSI support in `html2ps`. A later version implemented a fix for directory traversal, but had a regression that was quickly fixed by a patch. Finally a new version was released with the corrected patch.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `html2ps` version 1.0b7.
- The bug report indicates that the vulnerability affects Fedora 10, 11, rawhide, EPEL 5.
- It is unlikely that many people would be using `html2ps` as a CGI to parse untrusted user input, however, the vulnerability is still present if the application is used in such a way.
