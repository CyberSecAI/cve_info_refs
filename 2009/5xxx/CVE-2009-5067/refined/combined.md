| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=526513#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-09-30 17:26:22 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that html2ps suffers from an arbitrary file disclosure in SSI directives, as noted via the exploit [2] posted to PacketStorm.  This has not been addressed upstream from what I can tell.  If html2ps is called via a web page that allows a user to upload the content to convert to ps, it could allow for abitrary file content disclosure based on the permissions of the user running html2ps.  This would affect html2ps in Fedora 10, 11, rawhide, and EPEL 5.  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=548633> [2] <http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/0909-exploits/html2ps-disclose.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=526513#c1)  Vincent Danen    2009-10-20 16:44:21 UTC  ``` This was not reported upstream at all, so I emailed the author.  He isn't really maintaining html2ps anymore, but did provide the following patch to disable SSI support:  *** 2526,2530 ****         $inc="";         $file=$3; !       if($1 eq "include" && (substr($file,0,1) ne "/" || $opt_r)) {           if(substr($file,0,1) ne "/") {             $file=$B2.$file; --- 2526,2530 ----         $inc="";         $file=$3; !       if(0 && $1 eq "include" && (substr($file,0,1) ne "/" || $opt_r)) {           if(substr($file,0,1) ne "/") {             $file=$B2.$file;  He has, however, indicated that he will try to come up with a better fix.  I think it unlikely that many people would be using html2ps as a CGI to parse untrusted user input, so it may be prudent to disable the support altogether if we do not get an appropriate fix or cannot come up with one.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=526513#c3)  Vincent Danen    2009-10-22 15:36:05 UTC  ``` Upstream has released 1.0b6 to address this issue:    091021 1.0b6   "Security" fix. Changed behavior for SSI, to avoid having                  arbitrary readable files disclosed on a web server that uses                  html2ps in a web application (cgi script etc), allowing HTML                  files to be uploaded for conversion. Setting up a service like                  this is begging for trouble in my opinion. (Is /bin/cat also                  a vulnerability, since one can use it in a web app, allowing                  uploading arbitrary parameters to it?)  Could you update to the b6 release?  The diff is quite small so patching would be an option as well, but because the only change in this version is this fix, I think it would be better to update to the latest version.  <http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=526513#c7)  Petr Pisar    2010-04-27 11:50:36 UTC  ``` New upstream fix does two things: disable SSI by default and checks for ".." in file path.

However I think the patch is very trivial and bug in 1.0b6 upstream version is obvious.

Please use CVE-2009-5067 for this issue.

BTW if anyone wants to go through the Red Hat Bugzilla and make sure
all the security have CVE's assigned feel free to contact me and I can
let you know the easiest way to get the data/check it =).

```
Just an FYI, a new upstream release is available to correct this now
(b6).  Upstream had not been informed of this issue previously, and he
was quite responsive when I emailed him initially.  The patch can be
easily extracted as well if you don't want to update to the new beta,
but the new beta does nothing else but fix this issue.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.7) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

Subject: CVE Request: html2ps

Hello,

I don't believe a CVE was ever assigned to this html2ps flaw in 2009:

Directory traversal vulnerability in html2ps before 1.0b7 allows remote
attackers to read arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in
SSI directives

See:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=548633>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=526513>
<http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/81614/html2ps-1.0-beta5-File-Disclosure.html>

Thanks,

Marc.
