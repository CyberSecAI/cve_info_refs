Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-5091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `page.php` file of the Vlinks application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user input passed through the `id` parameter in the `page.php` file, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to gain unauthorized access to the application's database, potentially extracting sensitive information such as usernames and passwords (`nom` and `passe` from the `infos` table as shown in the exploit).
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With database access, an attacker could potentially modify data, escalate privileges or use the compromised system for further attacks on other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a specially crafted GET request to the vulnerable `page.php` file.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `id` parameter within the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Vlinks application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to construct malicious SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit provided is: `http://no-exploit.com/forum/page.php?nc=vbvb&id=-1 union select 0,concat(nom,0x3a,passe),2,3+from+infos--`
- This exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the `nom` (username) and `passe` (password) from the `infos` table, effectively bypassing the intended query.
- The `concat` function combines the username and password with a colon separator for easier data extraction.
