Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-5094:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided content from Exploit-DB explicitly mentions "CVE: 2009-5094" and links to the NVD page for this CVE, confirming its relevance. The exploit targets "CmsFaethon 2.2.0", which aligns with information that would be expected for CVE-2009-5094.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `info.php` script of CmsFaethon 2.2.0. The `item` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization on the `item` parameter in `info.php`, allowing for arbitrary SQL queries to be injected.
    - **Remote Code Execution via SQL Injection:** This is achieved through exploiting the `load_file()` and `into dumpfile` functions in MySQL, which allows an attacker to read error logs and write arbitrary PHP code to the server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Data Breach:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. The exploit provided demonstrates how to retrieve usernames and passwords.
   - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the SQL injection with `load_file()` to determine the path of the server from the error log and then using the `into dumpfile` to inject a webshell, attackers can gain remote code execution on the server.
   - **Full System Compromise:** RCE can lead to a full compromise of the server, allowing attackers to perform various malicious activities, such as installing malware, defacing websites, or using the server as a botnet node.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `info.php` script with a malicious SQL query in the `item` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
   - **Basic understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must understand SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.
   - **Ability to make HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
   - **Knowledge of Server Path (through error logs):** While the path can be determined using this exploit, some pre-existing knowledge or ability to infer path can be helpful.

**Additional Notes (from Exploit-DB)**
   - The exploit code provided automates the process of finding the path through error logs, injecting a webshell, and executing commands. It's notable that the exploit includes a method for finding the site's path using MySQL's `load_file` function to read error logs, which is a unique and clever approach to RCE.
   - The exploit also provides details on obtaining user credentials, reinforcing the severity of the SQL injection.
   - The exploit script uses HTTP requests through Perl's LWP module.
   - The provided exploit is for CmsFaethon 2.2.0-ultimate.

**Summary of extracted information:**

- **Root cause:** SQL injection vulnerability in the `item` parameter of `info.php`.
- **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, SQL injection vulnerability leading to RCE via MySQL functions.
- **Impact:** Data breach (credentials extraction), remote code execution, full server compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Crafted HTTP GET requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities:** Network access, SQL injection knowledge, ability to send HTTP requests, ability to determine server path.
