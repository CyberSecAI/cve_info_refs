| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=640177#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2010-10-05 06:37:00 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-50.html>  #  Security Fix: Replication: It was possible when using statement-based replication to subvert the MySQL privilege system on a slave with a higher server release version number than that of the master by using version-specific comments in statements run on the master.  A more detailed explanation follows:  In MySQL, a version-specific comment is an SQL comment of the form /*!nnnnn sql */ where nnnnn represents a MySQL release version number and sql represents a string of SQL, or a portion of a string of SQL, that should be executed by the MySQL Server only if the server version is at least version n.nn. (For additional information and an example, see Section 8.6, “Comment Syntax”.)  In MySQL replication, the slave SQL thread executes with the SUPER privilege, regardless of the privileges with which statements are originally executed on the master. Specific to this issue, when using statement-based replication it was possible, when the slave was of a higher MySQL version than the master, to run statements that would have failed on the master due to insufficient privileges, except that these statements were wrapped in version-specific comments where the encoded version was greater than the MySQL server version of the master. However, if the MySQL release version of the slave was equal to or greater than the version encoded in the comment, the same statements could execute on this slave whose MySQL release version was less than the version number used in the comment.  Suppose that a master running MySQL 5.1.48 replicated to a slave running MySQL 4.1.49, and that a user user1 had privileges to run UPDATE statements on database db1 but no privileges at all on the mysql system database, so that the first of the following two statements succeeded, but the second statement failed, and thus the first statement was written to the binary log, but the second statement was not:         UPDATE db1.tb1 SET db1.tbl1.col1=2;   UPDATE mysql.user SET mysql.user.Super_priv='Y'      WHERE mysql.user.User='user1';  However, the text of the second statement could be wrapped in version-specific comments and thus “hidden” within the text of the first statement so that this new version of the first statement succeeded, and was written in its entireity to the binary log. The new statement containing the necessary portions of the statement affecting the “mysql.user” table wrapped within version-specific comments is shown here:  UPDATE db1.tbl1 /*!514900 ,mysql.user */      SET db1.tbl1.col1=2 /*!514900 ,mysql.user.Super_priv='Y'     WHERE mysql.user.User='user1'*/;  Thus, a 5.1.48 master would see this statement as identical to the first of the original two statements shown previously (UPDATE db1.tb1 SET db1.tbl1.col1=2). However, the version-specific comments within the statement just shown, when run on the MySQL 5.1.49 slave, were ignored; thus the slave SQL thread would execute the statement, as shown here, with the SUPER privilege, on the slave:         UPDATE db1.tbl1,mysql.user      SET db1.tbl1.col1=2,mysql.user.Super_priv='Y'     WHERE mysql.user.User='user1';  To fix this issue, the ! (exclamation) character is now stripped from comments prior to statements containing them being applied on replication slaves; thus, version-specific comments that are not applied on the master are treated as normal comments on the slave and also not applied there. ([Bug#49124](show_bug.cgi?id=49124 "CLOSED CANTFIX - Startup script prevents openldap from binding to a specific port"))     Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  MySQL 5.1.49  How reproducible:  see above  Steps to Reproduce: 1. see above 2. 3.

I've tested it and it fixes the issue described.   However, the regression test that is also a part of the upstream fix is not included in this patch. The reason is that the regression test has been developed for a bit newer version of mysql, that we have in RHEL-5, and many changes would have to be done to get the test working.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=640177#c3)  Tom Lane    2012-02-14 17:26:01 UTC  ``` The upstream fix for this should be included in our recent security update: RHSA-2012:0127 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0127.html> although this bug is not listed there since it is not a security issue.   ``` |  |

Description:
  /*!50200 Query Code */ is a special comment, it can be executed on those servers which's version is larger than the version appearing in the comments.
  It leads to a security issue when slave's version is larger than master's. A malicious user can improve his privileges on slaves, even he/her can execute any query on slave. Because slave SQL thread is running on super mode, so it can execute all queries which are replicated from master.

How to repeat:
1, Setup a replication. Slave's version must larger than master's. Set binlog-format as statement.
2, On master
   CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT);
   CREATE USER 'user1'@'localhost'.
   GRANT UPDATE ON t1 TO 'user1'@'localhost'.

3. Connect to master by using 'user1'.
   #This statement will fail because user1 does not have the privilege.
   UPDATＥ mysql.user SET mysql.user.Super_priv='Y'.
   #but user1 can executed a statement like this，if master's version is lower than 50200. only t1 is updated, but the whole statement is binlogged.
   UPDATE t1 /*!50200 , mysql.user */ SET t1.c1=1 /*!50200 , mysql.user.Super_priv='Y' */;
4. On slave.
   #the following log event will be executed and mysql.user be updated if slave's version is larger than 50200. user1 now have super privileges on slave.
   UPDATE t1 /*!50200 , mysql.user */ SET t1.c1=1 /*!50200 , mysql.user.Super_priv='Y' */;

Suggested fix:
1. If a special comment is not executed on master, it should not be binlogged.

After my analysis, the patch shall be a bit complex. So I set Risk as R3.
Please reassess whether it is worthy to fix it on mysql5.0 and lower version.

      [BUG#49124](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49124) Security issue with /*!-versioned */ SQL statements on Slave

      /*!50200 Query Code */ is a special comment that the query in it can
      be executed on those servers which's version is larger than the
      version appearing in the comment. It leads to a security issue when
      slave's version is larger than master's. A malicious user can improve
      his privileges on slaves, even he/her can execute any query on slave.
      Because slave SQL thread is running on super mode, so it can execute
      all queries which are replicated from master.

      This bug is fixed with the logic below:
      Even though the slave's version is larger than the spcial comments' version,
      they are not executed on slave if their versions are larger than master's
      version which appears in FORMAT_DESCRIPTION_EVENT

      [BUG#49124](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=49124) Security issue with /*!-versioned */ SQL statements on Slave

      /*![:version:] Query Code */, where [:version:] is a sequence of 5
      digits representing the mysql server version(e.g /*!50200 ... */),
      is a special comment that the query in it can be executed on those
      servers whose versions are larger than the version appearing in the
      comment. It leads to a security issue when slave's version is larger
      than master's. A malicious user can improve his privileges on slaves.
      Because slave SQL thread is running with SUPER privileges, so it can
      execute queries that he/she does not have privileges on master.

      This bug is fixed with the logic below:
      - To replace '!' with ' ' in the magic comments which are not applied on
        master. So they become common comments and will not be applied on slave.

      - Example:
        'INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1) /*!10000, (2)*/ /*!99999 ,(3)*/
        will be binlogged as
        'INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1) /*!10000, (2)*/ /* 99999 ,(3)*/
