Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2009-5026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way MySQL handles version-specific comments ( `/*!nnnnn sql */` ) during replication, specifically when a slave server runs a newer version of MySQL than the master server. The slave server's SQL thread operates with SUPER privileges, allowing it to execute statements that the master server would not due to privilege restrictions. When an attacker crafts SQL statements with version-specific comments, these comments can be used to hide malicious SQL code that is executed on the slave server because the slave has a higher MySQL version.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Executable Comments:** MySQL's feature of executing specific SQL code within comments based on the server version.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The slave SQL thread using SUPER privileges, irrespective of the user privileges on the master server.
- **Version Discrepancy:** The vulnerability relies on a master-slave setup where the slave has a higher MySQL version than the master.
- **Statement-Based Replication:** The issue occurs when using statement-based replication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the slave server, even if those commands would be blocked on the master due to insufficient privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can elevate their privileges on the slave server, potentially gaining full control over the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data on the slave server.
- **System Compromise:** In severe cases, the attacker may be able to compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SQL Injection:** An attacker would inject a SQL statement with version specific comments to a database on the MySQL master server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Database Write Access on Master:** The attacker needs the ability to add custom comments to a database on the MySQL server (master).
- **Master-Slave Replication Setup:** The attacker needs the presence of a MySQL master-slave replication environment where the slave server is running a newer version of MySQL than the master server
- **Statement Based Replication:** The replication on the server must be using statement based replication

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by stripping the `!` character from comments before statements are applied on replication slaves. This change ensures that version specific comments that were not executed on the master are treated as normal comments on the slave and therefore not executed.
Specifically, the fix replaces the '!' with a space, so the comment becomes a standard comment and is ignored by the slave SQL thread, or replaces the `!` with `#` which is also treated as a normal comment.
Patches were included in MySQL versions 5.0.93 and 5.1.50, among other releases.
