(Workaround until that is available through new MRG packages is to reduce the max-frame-size option in ConnectionSettings).  To test, send large messages (e.g. using perftest) with the cyrus-sasl-md5 package installed and use the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism if available (it is usually preferred over other mechanisms, but can be forced by specifying the mechanism on command line).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=501792#c3)  Jiri Kolar    2010-08-04 08:36:19 UTC  ``` Tested: on 752581-26 bug aapears (but only on x86_64)  on later it does not, tested on 946106-11  it is fixed  validated on RHEL5.5/RHEL4  i386 / x86_64    packages:  # rpm -qa | grep -E '(qpid|openais|rhm)' | sort -u openais-0.80.6-16.el5_5.2 openais-devel-0.80.6-16.el5_5.2 python-qpid-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-client-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-client-devel-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-client-devel-docs-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-client-ssl-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-mrg-debuginfo-0.7.946106-8.el5 qpid-cpp-server-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-server-cluster-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-server-devel-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-server-ssl-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-server-store-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-cpp-server-xml-0.7.946106-11.el5 qpid-java-client-0.7.946106-7.el5 qpid-java-common-0.7.946106-7.el5 qpid-tools-0.7.946106-8.el5 rhm-docs-0.7.946106-4.el5 rh-tests-distribution-MRG-Messaging-qpid_common-1.6-52   ->VERIFIED   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=501792#c4)  Jaromir Hradilek    2010-10-07 15:46:06 UTC  ```      Technical note added.
