Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-5005 and CVE-2009-5006:

**CVE-2009-5005**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in Apache Qpid's handling of invalid AMQP data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper input validation, leading to a crash when receiving malformed AMQP data.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker could send invalid AMQP data to the server, causing it to crash and shut down the cluster. This would result in a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending specially crafted, invalid AMQP data to the affected server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable Apache Qpid server.

**CVE-2009-5006**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in Apache Qpid's handling of requests to redeclare an existing exchange while adding a new alternate exchange.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper handling when redeclaring an existing exchange with a new alternate exchange leads to a crash.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An authenticated remote user could send a specific request to the server causing it to crash, resulting in the cluster shutting down and leading to a denial of service.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Sending a specially crafted request to redeclare an exchange with a new alternate exchange.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user.
