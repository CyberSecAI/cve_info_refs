### CVE-2009-20001
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The MantisBT application uses a fixed cookie string for each user, stored in the database. This cookie string is not reset or invalidated upon user logout, allowing for session reuse.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Session Hijacking:**  The primary vulnerability is that a user's session cookie remains valid even after logout. This allows an attacker who has obtained the cookie to bypass login procedures.
- **Lack of Session Invalidation:** The system does not invalidate the session cookie when a user logs out, enabling persistent unauthorized access if the cookie is compromised.
- **Fixed Cookie Strings:** The cookie string for each user is fixed and stored in the database, instead of being unique to each session.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain full access to a user's account without needing their login credentials.
- **Data Modification:** Once logged in, the attacker can view, modify, or delete data associated with the compromised account.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could change user options, passwords, or profiles.
- **Server Compromise:** Malicious actors could potentially gain access to the server, and use it for future attacks or data theft.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can steal the cookie using various methods such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) or by intercepting network traffic, especially on insecure networks.
- **Direct Cookie Manipulation:**  Attackers can use browser plugins or tools like Tamper Data to directly inject stolen cookie values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to User Cookies:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid `MANTIS_STRING_COOKIE` value for a target user. This could be through sniffing network traffic, exploiting XSS, or other methods of cookie theft.
- **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Headers:** The attacker requires the ability to modify HTTP headers to inject the stolen cookie value when accessing the MantisBT application.

**Additional details:**

-   The vulnerability is related to issue `0011296`, which discusses Mantis BT using fixed cookies in the DB.
-   The issue was resolved by implementing a mechanism to reset the user's cookie string upon logout by setting the cookie string to an empty string, and generating a new one upon next login.
-   Later, the fix was changed to generate a new random cookie string upon logout instead of setting it to an empty string.

The provided information gives a good explanation of the root cause, attack vector, and resolution of this issue.
