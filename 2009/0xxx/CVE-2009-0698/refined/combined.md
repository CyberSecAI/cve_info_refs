### Bug Description

Binary package hint: libxine-main1

I am running 6.06LTS:

$ lsb\_release -rd

Description: Ubuntu 6.06.2 LTS

Release: 6.06

A security update just became available, which I installed. After upgrading libxine-main1 to version 1.1.1+ubuntu2-7.10(dapper-security), gxine will not play any (video) mpg files produced by a ReplayTV video recorder. When I start gxine from the command line:

$ gxine test.mpg

gxine opens a window, momentarily displays the filename, and does nothing more. It does not crash, and still responds properly to keystrokes and will play other files.

If I downgrade to the 1.1.1+ubuntu2-7(dapper) version, the videos play properly.

I have attached a two second video clip that will not play with the update, but does play with the earlier version.

mplayer and vlc will properly play these files.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
Advisory: FFmpeg Type Conversion Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2009-004
Revision: 1.2
Release Date: 2009/01/28
Last Modified: 2009/02/15
Date Reported: 2009/01/25
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: FFmpeg SVN trunk < revision 16846
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0385
Patch development time: > 1 day (exactly 2h)
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
FFmpeg contains a type conversion vulnerability while parsing malformed 4X
movie files. The vulnerability may be exploited by a (remote) attacker to
execute arbitrary code in the context of FFmpeg or an application using
the FFmpeg library.
FFmpeg is used by a lot of popular software projects like VLC media player
[1], Mplayer [2], Perian [3] and Xine [4].
Note: A similar issue also affects xine-lib < version 1.1.16.2 (see [7]).
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file: libavformat/4xm.c
[..]
93 static int fourxm\_read\_header(AVFormatContext \*s,
94 AVFormatParameters \*ap)
95 {
..
103 [8] int current\_track = -1;
..
106 [9] fourxm->track\_count = 0;
107 [10] fourxm->tracks = NULL;
..
160 } else if (fourcc\_tag == strk\_TAG) {
161 /\* check that there is enough data \*/
162 if (size != strk\_SIZE) {
163 av\_free(header);
164 return AVERROR\_INVALIDDATA;
165 }
166 [1] current\_track = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 8]);
167 [2] if (current\_track + 1 > fourxm->track\_count) {
168 fourxm->track\_count = current\_track + 1;
169 if((unsigned)fourxm->track\_count >= UINT\_MAX /
sizeof(AudioTrack))
170 return -1;
171 [3] fourxm->tracks = av\_realloc(fourxm->tracks,
172 fourxm->track\_count \* sizeof(AudioTrack));
173 if (!fourxm->tracks) {
174 av\_free(header);
175 return AVERROR(ENOMEM);
176 }
177 }
178 [4] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].adpcm = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 12]);
179 [5] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].channels = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 36]);
180 [6] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].sample\_rate = AV\_RL32(&header[i+40]);
181 [7] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].bits = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 44]);
[..]
[1] The signed int variable "current\_track" (see [8]) is filled with user
supplied data from the media file
[2] This statement checks if the user controlled value of "current\_track"
is greater than "fourxm->track\_count". The variable "fourxm-
>track\_count" is initialized with 0 (see [9]). By supplying a value >=
0x80000000 for "current\_track" it is possible to cause a change in sign
that results in "current\_track" being negative. If "current\_track" is
negative, the if statement will always return false and the buffer
allocation in [3] will never be reached.
[4] As "fourxm->tracks" is initialized with NULL (see [10]) and line 171 is
never reached this leads to an exploitable NULL pointer dereference. It
is possible to write 4 bytes of user controlled data to the memory
location "NULL + current\_track". As the value of "current\_track" is
also controlled by the user it is possible to write 4 bytes of
arbitrary data at a wide range of memory addresses.
[5] See [4]
[6] See [4]
[7] See [4]
A malicious party may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code by
overwriting a sensitive memory location (such as a GOT/IAT entry, a return
address, buffer length or boolean variable).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- openswan/strongswan
By sending a specially crafted Dead Peer Detection (DPD) packet
remote attackers could crash the pluto IKE daemon (CVE-2009-0790).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- clamav
ClamAV was updated to version 0.95 to also fix some potential security
bugs. (CVE-2009-1241)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-base
Specially crafted cover art tags in vorbis files could trigger a
heap overflow in the base64 decoder. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0586).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, SLE11
- gnome-panel
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services break
due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- postgresql
Remote authenticated users could crash the postgresql server by requesting
a conversion with an inappropriate encoding (CVE-2009-0922). This was a
minor version upgrade.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- acroread\_ja
Multiple flaws in the JBIG2 decoder and the JavaScript engine of the
Adobe Reader allowed attackers to crash acroread or even execute
arbitrary code by tricking users into opening specially crafted PDF
files. (CVE-2009-0658, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2009-0193, CVE-2009-0928,
CVE-2009-1061, CVE-2009-1062)
Affected products: SLED10-11
- ghostscript
With this update the ghostscript-library four vulnerabilities were fixed:
- heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder (CVE-2009-0196)
- integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792)
- crash in CCITTFax decoder
- buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module
Affected products: SLE11 (packages for other products will be
released soon)
- xine-devel/libxine-devel
Specially crafted 4x movie files could cause an integer overflow in
xine-lib (CVE-2009-0698).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10-11
- moodle
Special command sequences in TeX files allowed users to read arbitrary
files (CVE-2009-1171).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gnutls
The previous security fix for gnutls (CVE-2008-4989) introduced a re-
gression in the X.509 validation code for self-signed certificates.
This update fixes this problem.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10 (will be released soon),
SLE11
- udev update on SLES 10 requires udevd restart
The previously released udev update requires a restart of the udev
daemon on SLES 10. Either use
/etc/init.d/boot.udev restart
or reboot the machine.
On other SUSE products udevd is restarted by just applying the update
already.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-746-1: xine-lib vulnerability

26 March 2009

xine-lib vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [xine-lib](/security/cves?package=xine-lib) -

## Details

It was discovered that the 4xm demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle

a large current\_track value in a 4xm file, resulting in an integer

overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted 4xm movie file, an attacker could crash xine-lib or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2009-0698](/security/CVE-2009-0698))

USN-710-1 provided updated xine-lib packages to fix multiple security

vulnerabilities. The security patch to fix [CVE-2008-5239](/security/CVE-2008-5239) introduced a

regression causing some media files to be unplayable. This update corrects

the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the input handlers in xine-lib did not correctly

handle certain error codes, resulting in out-of-bounds reads and heap-

based buffer overflows. If a user or automated system were tricked into

opening a specially crafted file, stream, or URL, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-5239](/security/CVE-2008-5239))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libxine1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib)
  -
  [1.1.15-0ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib/1.1.15-0ubuntu3.2)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libxine1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib)
  -
  [1.1.11.1-1ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib/1.1.11.1-1ubuntu3.3)

##### Ubuntu 7.10

* [libxine1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib)
  -
  [1.1.7-1ubuntu1.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib/1.1.7-1ubuntu1.5)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [libxine-main1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib)
  -
  [1.1.1+ubuntu2-7.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xine-lib/1.1.1%2Bubuntu2-7.11)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart applications linked

against xine-lib, such as Totem-xine and Amarok, to effect the necessary

changes.
