Debian Security Advisory DSA-1730-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Steffen Joeris

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : proftpd-dfsg
Vulnerability  : SQL injection vulnerabilites
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-0542 CVE-2009-0543

The security update for proftpd-dfsg in DSA-1727-1 caused a regression
with the postgresql backend. This update corrects the flaw. Also it was
discovered that the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by the
security issues. For reference the original advisory follows.

Two SQL injection vulnerabilities have been found in proftpd, a
virtual-hosting FTP daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0542

Shino discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability
via the use of certain characters in the username.

CVE-2009-0543

TJ Saunders discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection
vulnerability due to insufficient escaping mechanisms, when multybite
character encodings are used.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny2.

The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2-1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:18:26 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached tcl-8.3.3.ebuild and tk-8.3.3.ebuild.  These ebuilds accomplish the following:  1. split the tcl and tk packages into separate ebuilds. This makes writing ebuilds for packages that depend on tcl and/or tk much easier to handle (see expect-5.33.0.ebuild post and the vim-6.0-r2.ebuild patch attached).  I recommend putting the tcl ebuild under dev-lang/tcl and the tk ebuild under dev-tcltk/tk.   2. ebuilds are now version independent.   Renaming ebuilds to *-8.4.2.ebuild should work.  I have not tested this, but these ebuilds were based on the tcl-tk-8.4.2.ebuild.  3. The original tcl-tk-8.3.3.ebuild did not install the private headers and config.sh's for tcl and tk.  This is why vim-6.0-r2.ebuild did not work with 'use tcltk'  4. Promotes world peace and smells minty fresh.  Splitting up tcl and tk into separate ebuilds may cause some minor pain updating the dependencies of ebuilds that depend on them, but I think it is worth it in the long run.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M.

The expect ebuild ([bug 28](show_bug.cgi?id=28 "RESOLVED FIXED - expect-5.33.0.ebuild")) is a good test of a working tcl and tk installation. It depends on tcl-8.3* and tk-8.3*, but won't compile because the private headers are not installed by the current tcl-tk ebuild.  2. Contrary to my original comments, the submitted tcl-8.3.3 ebuild does not fix the vim --with-tcl problem.  It does allow vim to be compiled successfully using the --with-tcl configure flag and the resulting vim appears to run fine, however it doesn't pass the  VIMINIT='let OS = system("uname -s")' vim test that agriffis pointed out to me (see vim-6.0-r3.ebuild)  This appears to be an upstream vim issue.  tod ``` |  |

Oh, forgot to ask.  It looks like this would have been introduced in
1.3.1.  Is that correct?  So the affected versions would be
1.3.1 to 1.3.2rc2.

Also, as I was looking at the Gentoo report, I noticed bug #3173 which
likely also needs a CVE name (for the "encoding-dependent SQL injection
vulnerability").

Thanks.

Yes; I was just about to note the same thing. =)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ProFTPD: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-27**

Two vulnerabilities in ProFTPD might allow for SQL injection attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/proftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.2** |

### Background

ProFTPD is an advanced and very configurable FTP server.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were reported:

* Percent characters in the username are not properly handled, which
  introduces a single quote character during variable substitution by
  mod\_sql (CVE-2009-0542).
* Some invalid, encoded multibyte characters are not properly handled in
  mod\_sql\_mysql and mod\_sql\_postgres when NLS support is enabled
  (CVE-2009-0543).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests to the server,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary SQL statements.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.2"
```
### References

* [CVE-2009-0542](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0542)
* [CVE-2009-0543](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0543)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3173#c0)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-05 13:45:51 UTC  ``` An attacker able to submit crafted strings to an application that will embed those strings in SQL commands can use invalidly-encoded multibyte characters to bypass standard string-escaping methods, resulting in possible injection of hostile SQL commands into the database. The attacks covered here work in any multibyte encoding.  This class of vulnerability has been seen in other products as well:    <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2314>   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2753>   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2384>  Affects ProFTPD 1.3.1 and later (but NOT earlier versions) that have NLS support enabled.  If your LANG environment variable uses the "C" or "POSIX" locale, you are not vulnerable. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3173#c1)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-05 13:49:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2945](attachment.cgi?id=2945 "Fixes vulnerability in mod_sql_mysql, mod_sql_postgres") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2945&action=edit "Fixes vulnerability in mod_sql_mysql, mod_sql_postgres") Fixes vulnerability in mod_sql_mysql, mod_sql_postgres ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3173#c2)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-05 13:51:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2946](attachment.cgi?id=2946 "Version of the patch for proftpd-1.3.1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2946&action=edit "Version of the patch for proftpd-1.3.1") Version of the patch for proftpd-1.3.1 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3173#c3)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-05 13:54:39 UTC  ``` Patch committed to CVS. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3173#c4)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-05 14:36:18 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.2. ``` |  |
