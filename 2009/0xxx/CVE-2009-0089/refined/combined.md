How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-013 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Windows HTTP Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution (960803)

Published: April 14, 2009 | Updated: April 29, 2009

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP). The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing the way that Windows HTTP Services handles errors and validates certificates, and by ensuring that Windows HTTP Services correctly use NTLM credential reflection protection mechanisms. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on April 29, 2009?**

This bulletin was revised to communicate that the **Known issues with this security update** section in the associated [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960803](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960803) has been updated to describe an application compatibility issue between this update and systems running the Websense Logon Agent configured to use Windows Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication.

**Where are the file information details?**

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960803](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960803).

**Are the Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 Beta, Windows Vista Service Pack 2 Beta, and Windows 7 Beta releases affected by this vulnerability?**
Yes. These vulnerabilities were reported after the release of Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 Beta, Windows Vista Service Pack 2 Beta, and Windows 7 Beta. Customers running these platforms are encouraged to download and apply the update to their systems.

Security updates are available from [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) and [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**How is this security update related to MS09-014?**

The Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability, [CVE-2009-0550](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0550), described in this security bulletin also affects Internet Explorer and the Windows Internet (WinINet) API. Microsoft recommends that users of Internet Explorer also install the security update provided by [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027).

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960803](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960803) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes, in order to resolve the issue described in CVE-2009-0089, Microsoft has implemented a new registry key UseFQDNFallbackForCnCompare under SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WinHttp, which controls the behavior of WinHTTP when validating the fully qualified domain name of a host against a certificate's distinguished name entry.

By default, this registry key does not exist, which ensures WinHTTP fully validates that the distinguished name (DN) contained in the certificate is identical to the DN to which the connection was initiated. The old behavior can be re-enabled by setting this registry key to True. In this case, validation will be less strict and will accept if the certificate matches a name change through forwarding at the DNS level. This is the less secure behavior which is default prior to the installation of this security update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Windows HTTP Services Integer Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0086

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with the same user rights as the service or application which calls the WinHTTP API to connect to the attacker's Web server.

This vulnerability affects Windows components and third-party applications that use Windows HTTP Services and are configured to connect to remote, untrusted Web servers.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by lack of validation of a parameter returned by a remote Web server. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**What is Windows HTTP Services?**

Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to Web servers. WinHTTP can be used by both Microsoft Windows components and third-party software. WinHTTP is, amongst others, used by the Universal Plug and Play (UPNP) Service.

**What is Universal Plug and Play?**

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a capability that allows devices on a network to discover other devices and determine how to work with them. UPnP is most easily understood by comparison to plug-and-play (PnP) capability that most Windows users already are familiar with. PnP allows the operating system to detect new hardware when you install it on a system. For instance, when you install a new mouse onto your computer, PnP allows Windows to detect it, load the needed drivers, and begin using it. UPnP extends this concept to devices on a network, rather than on the local system itself. UPnP lets computers learn about other devices on the network, and determine how to use them. For instance, a computer could use UPnP to detect whether there are printers on the network that it can use and learn how to use them.

**What is the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)?**

Device discovery is the process through which UPnP-capable computers become aware of the availability of devices they can use, and learn how to request services from them. When a UPnP-capable computer boots, there may already be devices on the network that it can use. To determine whether this is the case, the computer sends a broadcast request (called an M-SEARCH directive), asking that any UPnP-capable device within the subnet respond directly to it and provide information about using it.

Similarly, when a device that supports UPnP (for instance, a UPnP-capable printer) boots, there may already be UPnP-capable computers on the network that would like to use it. The device broadcasts a message (called a NOTIFY directive) to all computers within the subnet, announcing its presence on the network and inviting computers to make use of its services.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the service or application which calls the WinHTTP API to connect to the attacker's Web server. Applications running under accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than applications running under accounts with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker would need to force or entice a program using Windows HTTP Services to connect to his malicious Web server. It is important to note that the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service uses the WinHTTP libraries. When this service is enabled, malicious users on the local subnet may respond to SSDP requests and lead the UPnP service to connect using WinHTTP to a malicious host that could then exploit this vulnerability. The UPNP service runs under the LocalService account, which is an account with limited privileges on the system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows HTTP Services handles the error resulting in the exploitable condition.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0089

A spoofing vulnerability exists in Windows HTTP Services as a result of the incomplete validation of the distinguished name in a digital certificate. When combined with specific other attacks, such as DNS spoofing, this may allow an attacker to successfully spoof the digital certificate of a Web site for any application that uses Windows HTTP Services.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0089](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0089).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0089

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* All supported editions of Internet Explorer are not affected by this vulnerability because Windows HTTP Services is not used by the software.

#### Workarounds for Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0089

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0089

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a spoofing vulnerability that exists in Windows HTTP Services. When combined with specific other attacks, such as DNS spoofing, this may allow an attacker to successfully spoof the digital certificate of a Web site for any application that uses Windows HTTP Services.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When an application calls into Windows HTTP Services to set up a connection to a remote Web server, WinHTTP only validates the fully qualified domain name of the URL against the certificate of the original Web site to which the host attempted connect to. Specific combinations of DNS spoofing may forward a connection to a different Web server that has a valid certificate for that specific host, but not for the web page to which WinHTTP initiated the connection. The combination of DNS spoofing and this vulnerability could lead to WinHTTP incorrectly considering the certificate for the remote Web server as acceptable. As WinHTTP depends on the application for user interaction, the user might not be warned of this discrepancy by the application.

**What is Windows HTTP Services?**

Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to other HTTP servers.

**What are digital certificates?**

The digital certificate is a common credential that's used to authenticate identity. A trusted organization assigns a certificate to an individual or an entity, the subject of that certificate. The trusted organization that issues the certificate is a Certification Authority (CA) and is known as the certificate's issuer. A trustworthy CA will issue a certificate only after verifying the identity of the certificate's subject.

**What is DNS spoofing?**

Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the industry-standard suite of protocols that comprise TCP/IP. DNS is implemented using two software components: the DNS server and the DNS client (or resolver). Both components are run as background service applications. Network resources are identified by numeric IP addresses, but these IP addresses are difficult for network users to remember. The DNS database contains records that map user-friendly alphanumeric names for network resources to the IP addresses used by those resources for communication. In this way, DNS acts as a mnemonic device, making network resources easier to remember for network users. For more information and to view logical diagrams illustrating how DNS fits with other Windows technologies, review the TechNet article, [What is DNS?](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc787921.aspx)

DNS Spoofing is a broad category of attacks in which at one point within the DNS system, incorrect DNS responses are introduced by a third party not normally responsible for those responses. Such an attack may cause a domain or host name to resolve to an IP address to which it was not intended to resolve by the owners of that name. As such, a host may be elicited to connect to a third-party, potentially malicious server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker could impersonate a secure Web site and offer malicious content to the application using Windows HTTP Services, which would trust it as if it originated from a secure Web site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker would need to combine this vulnerability with DNS spoofing or a similar attack in order to direct the outbound connection to a server under his control. He would then offer a certificate valid for the his Web site connected to which would be incorrectly validated by Windows HTTP Services as valid for the destination host Web site to which the user originally tried to connect.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by changing the way Windows HTTP Services validates certificates belonging to a secure Web site.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows HTTP Services handles NTLM credentials when a user connects to an attacker's Web server. This vulnerability allows an attacker to replay the user's credentials back to the attacker and execute code in the context of the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0550](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0550).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* All supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 by default have the profile for the Windows firewall set to public, which reduces exposure on these platforms to this vulnerability because, under public profile, the firewall blocks SMB traffic. Since the client would need to be running a service which accepts NTLM authentication in order for the attack to be successful and the credentials reflected, the most common attack vector would be SMB.

#### Workarounds for Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In addition, this issue also affects Internet Explorer and the Windows Internet API. Microsoft recommends that users of Internet Explorer install the security update provided by [MS09-014](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027).

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Windows HTTP Services does not correctly opt-in to NTLM credential-reflection protections to ensure that a user's credentials are not reflected back and used against the user.

**What is Microsoft Windows HTTP Services?**

Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to other HTTP servers.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker could gain the rights of the logged-on user and do anything that the logged-on user has privileges to do. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user with an affected version of Windows HTTP Services accesses a malicious server. An attacker would have to host a specially crafted Web server which captures the user's NTLM log on credentials. The attacker then replays those credentials to a service on the user's client that accepts NTLM authentication. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted server. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.
