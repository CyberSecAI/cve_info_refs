  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-0089",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incomplete validation of the distinguished name in a digital certificate by Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP). When an application uses WinHTTP to connect to a remote web server, WinHTTP only validates the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the URL against the certificate of the original web site to which the host attempted to connect.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incomplete validation of the distinguished name in a digital certificate",
        "Lack of strict validation of the certificate against the requested resource"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could impersonate a secure web site and offer malicious content to an application using Windows HTTP Services. The application would trust the content as if it originated from the legitimate secure web site, leading to potential spoofing attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "DNS spoofing or similar attacks that redirect connections to a malicious server",
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker intercepts and alters network traffic"
      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": [
          "Ability to perform DNS spoofing or similar network redirection attacks",
          "Possession of a valid certificate for the attacker's malicious web site"
        ]
