- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the `id` parameter in the `classified.php` page before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive data such as user emails and passwords in plain text. An attacker could also manipulate other data in the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious `id` parameter to the `classified.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
