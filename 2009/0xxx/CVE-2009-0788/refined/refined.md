Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from incorrect `mod_rewrite` rules within Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite. These rules govern how URLs are rewritten and processed by the web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  The flawed rewrite rules allow an unauthenticated user to craft specific HTTP requests that can expose sensitive information about the host system running RHN Satellite.
- **Abuse as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Tool:** The incorrect rules could be exploited to make RHN Satellite connect to arbitrary services at arbitrary IP addresses by using crafted HTTP requests, turning it into a DDoS tool.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Exposure:** Attackers could potentially obtain configuration details, system specifics, and potentially other sensitive data from the RHN Satellite server.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** By forcing the RHN Satellite to make connections to external targets, attackers could disrupt services, potentially overwhelming network resources and causing availability issues on the targeted external IP addresses.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable RHN Satellite instance. These requests exploit the incorrect `mod_rewrite` rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not require authentication. The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable RHN Satellite instance.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report indicates that the issue was resolved in Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.3 and v 5.4 via RHSA-2011:0434.
- There is also mention of tracking bugs in 'spacewalk-backend' for the same issue.
- The bug was initially reported in 2009 and fixed in 2011.
