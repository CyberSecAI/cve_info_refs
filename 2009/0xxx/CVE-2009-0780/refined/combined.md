How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 30, 2008**
    *All architectures*

  sshd(8) would execute ~/.ssh/rc even when a sshd\_config(5) *ForceCommand*
  directive was in effect, allowing users with write access to this file to
  execute arbitrary commands. This behaviour was documented, but was an unsafe
  default and an extra hassle for administrators.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/001_openssh.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: April 3, 2008**
      *All architectures*

    Avoid possible hijacking of X11-forwarded connections with sshd(8)
    by refusing to listen on a port unless all address families bind
    successfully.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/002_openssh2.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: July 15, 2008**
        *All architectures*

      Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in X.Org.

      RENDER Extension heap buffer overflow,
      RENDER Extension crash,
      RENDER Extension memory corruption,
      MIT-SHM arbitrary memory read,
      RECORD and Security extensions memory corruption.
      [CVE-2008-2360](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2360),
      [CVE-2008-2361](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2361),

      [CVE-2008-1377](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1377).

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/003_xorg.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: July 23, 2008**
          *All architectures*

        **2nd revision, July 23, 2008**

        A vulnerability has been found with BIND. An attacker could use this vulnerability
        to poison the cache of a recursive resolving name server.
        [CVE-2008-1447](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447).

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/004_bind.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: July 29, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          Some kinds of IPv6 usage would leak kernel memory (in particular, this path
          was exercised by the named(8) patch for port randomization). Since INET6 is
          enabled by default, this condition affects all systems.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/005_pcb.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: October 2, 2008**
              *All architectures*

            The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
            solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
            The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
            this vulnerability to be exploited.
            [CVE-2008-2476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2476).

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.3/common/006_ndp.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: January 9, 2009**
                *All architectures*

              The OpenSSL libraries did not correctly check the return value from
              certain verification functions, allowing validation to be bypassed and
              permitting a remote attacker to conduct a "man in the middle attack"
              against SSL/TLS connections if the server is configured with a DSA or ECDSA
              certificate.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: November 2, 2008**
    *All architectures*

  The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
  solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
  The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
  this vulnerability to be exploited.
  [CVE-2008-2476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2476).

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/001_ndp.patch)

  * **002: RELIABILITY FIX: November 2, 2008**
      *All architectures*

    Due to a bug in the vr(4) driver it is possible for a system using the vr(4)
    driver to panic under heavy load if the RX path runs out of mbufs.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/002_vr.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: November 6, 2008**
        *All architectures*

      Fix the IPv4 TCP/IP stack's TIME\_WAIT socket recycling. Due to the bug this
      can result in TCP connections between two IPs being reset instead of accepted
      if being received on a socket in the TIME\_WAIT state.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 6, 2008**
          *All architectures*

        Fix
        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.4/httpd.8)'s
        mod\_proxy module which is broken on 64-bit architectures. Due to the bug this
        will result in child processes crashing when utilizing proxy rules during an
        HTTP session.

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: November 7, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          A software bug could cause memory allocation to cause a kernel panic
          accessing an array out of its bounds, when physical memory is exhausted.

          * **006: RELIABILITY FIX: November 19, 2008**
              *All architectures*

            Due to changes in the options handling this caused problems with some
            DHCP clients such as Solaris/OpenSolaris and some embedded routers not
            accepting DHCP offers.

              certain verification functions, allowing validation to be bypassed and
              permitting a remote attacker to conduct a "man in the middle attack"
