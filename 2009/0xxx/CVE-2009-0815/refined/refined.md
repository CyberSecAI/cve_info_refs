Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-0815:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The `jumpUrl` mechanism in TYPO3 core exposed a mandatory hash secret, intended to prevent unauthorized access, to remote users. This allowed attackers to bypass access controls.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Three fields in the TYPO3 backend user interface failed to properly sanitize user input, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Leaking of a secret hash key, which was used to validate access, via the `jumpUrl` mechanism.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Inadequate sanitization of user inputs in backend fields allowed malicious script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Remote attackers could read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files like `typo3conf/localconf.php`, which contains database credentials and the install tool password.
    *   The leaked credentials could allow attackers to gain control of the website by accessing the install tool.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   Attackers could inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the backend interface, leading to potential malicious actions within a user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Remote attackers could exploit the vulnerability via crafted URLs using the leaked hash, by exploiting the `jumpUrl` mechanism.
    *   No authentication was required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   Attackers could exploit the XSS vulnerability by injecting malicious code through vulnerable backend input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   The attacker needed to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 installation. No special privileges or prior authentication was necessary.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   The attacker needed to be able to access the backend of the TYPO3 system. They would need to be logged into the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes patches and instructions for fixing the vulnerabilities, indicating the vendor was aware and provided a resolution.
*   The TYPO3 security team, including Marcus Krause and Michael Stucki, are credited with discovering and patching the Information Disclosure vulnerability. Jelmer de Hen and Dmitry Dulepov are credited with discovering and fixing the XSS issues.
*   The advisory emphasizes the need to change the encryption key after applying the updates due to the possibility of its compromise.
*   The affected versions of TYPO3 ranged from 3.3.x up to 4.3alpha1.
*   Debian also released an advisory (DSA 1720-1) addressing these vulnerabilities, highlighting their wide impact.
