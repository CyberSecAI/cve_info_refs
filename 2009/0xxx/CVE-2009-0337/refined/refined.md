Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-0337:

**Vulnerability Summary:**

The provided content from exploit-db.com indicates that the vulnerability, identified by CVE-2009-0337 (along with CVE-2009-0336, CVE-2009-0335, and CVE-2009-0334), exists in Blogit!, a PHP-based web application. It highlights a combination of vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Direct Database Disclosure, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper input sanitization in the `index.asp` script when handling the `day` parameter within the archive view. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Direct Database Disclosure:** The database file `Blog.mdb` is directly accessible through the web server, which is generally a very bad practice.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient input validation when rendering the `view` parameter in `index.asp`  allows injection of malicious JavaScript code within the page context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application does not properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input in the `day` parameter within archive view of `index.asp`. This allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL queries by attackers
*  **Direct Database Disclosure (DD):** The database file is directly accessible via web, making it vulnerable for theft
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the `view` parameter within `index.asp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database permissions, attackers could potentially gain administrative access to the database.
*   **Direct Database Disclosure:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can download the entire database file containing all the application's data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user cookies or session tokens.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Attackers can alter the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `index.asp?view=archive&day=[SQL]` by using SQL injection payloads within the `day` parameter.
*   **Direct Database Disclosure:** Directly accessing the database file via a web browser using the URL `http://site.com/[Path]/database/Blog.mdb`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Crafting a malicious URL with JavaScript code injected into the `view` parameter  such as `http://site.com/[Path]/index.asp?view='+style='background:url(JaVaScRiPt:alert(1369))'+invalidparam='&day=1&month=12&year=2008`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs knowledge of crafting HTTP requests.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some SQL skills to craft an SQL injection payload.
*   **Basic understanding of HTML/Javascript:** The attacker needs to know how to inject Javascript code for XSS attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db.com entry provides specific URLs demonstrating how to exploit each vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects Blogit! application.
*   This entry on Exploit-DB associates multiple CVEs to the same vulnerabilities, suggesting that they were found around the same time or are different aspects of the same issue.
