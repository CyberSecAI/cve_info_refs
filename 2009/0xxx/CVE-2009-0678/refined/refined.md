**Summary:**

The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in RavenNuke version 2.3.0, which are collectively associated with CVE-2009-0678. These include remote code execution, SQL injection, and local file disclosure issues. The advisory also mentions the release of RavenNuke 2.30.01 as a fix for these vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerability Details:**

1.  **Remote PHP Code Execution in "avatarlist.php"**
    *   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized arrays `patterns` and `replacements` used in `preg_replace` with the `e` modifier.
    *   **Weakness:** Use of `preg_replace` with the `e` modifier allows for arbitrary PHP code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Full remote code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending crafted `patterns` and `replacements` parameters via GET or POST request to `modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=avatarlist`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Attacker must be logged in as a user.

2.  **Remote PHP Code Execution in "Your Account" module**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insecure use of the `eval()` function with user-controlled data from custom fields.
    *   **Weakness:**  Arbitrary code execution due to `eval()`.
    *  **Impact:** Full remote code execution
    *   **Attack Vector:**  An administrator inserts malicious code into the "ID Field Name" field of a custom user field. When user details are accessed, the code is executed.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Admin access to the "Your Account" module settings.

3.  **SQL Injection in "Resend_Email" module**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insecure use of the `extract()` function, which allows overwriting the `$user_prefix` variable, leading to SQL Injection.
    *   **Weakness:**  SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for data exfiltration and modification.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `user_prefix` parameter via POST request to `modules.php?name=Resend_Email`.
    *  **Required Capabilities:**  Attacker must be logged in as an administrator.

4.  **Remote Detection of Local Files in "captcha.php"**
    *   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized array `aFonts` used in `imageftbbox()` function with `display_errors=on` and `register_globals=on`.
    *   **Weakness:**  Information disclosure by file path detection.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of local files and directories via error messages.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `aFonts[]` array via a GET request to `images/captcha.php`
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires `register_globals=on` and `display_errors=on` to be enabled on the server

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory from waraxe.us provides more technical detail than a typical CVE description.
*   The vulnerabilities were identified and fixed by the vendor in version 2.30.01 of RavenNuke.
*   The exploit-db entry lists CVE-2009-0678 alongside other related CVEs, suggesting these were all addressed in the same patch.
*   The "waraxe" advisory provides detailed steps to reproduce each vulnerability along with code snippets showing the vulnerable sections.
*   The waraxe advisory suggests that Sentinel will not stop the 'avatarlist.php' exploit and that post method exploits will leave clean logs, suggesting that logging and WAF may not detect the attack.
