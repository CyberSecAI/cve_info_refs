Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0122

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `hplip` package contained an installation script (`debian/hplip.postinst`) that attempted to correct permissions of `.hplip` configuration files in users' home directories. This script used a `find` command that was vulnerable to shell injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Script:** The script used `cat /etc/passwd` and `cut` to obtain user information, which is unreliable and doesn't account for all users.
- **Improper quoting:** The script did not properly quote arguments to the `find` command, making it vulnerable to shell injection if a user created a file with a specific name in the directory where `apt-get upgrade` was run from (e.g., a file named `.hplip`). It also did not account for special characters in usernames or home directories.
- **Modifying User Data:** The script attempted to change ownership of files within user home directories, which is a dangerous practice for package maintainer scripts and can lead to data loss or system compromise.
- **Attempt to Correct Permissions**: The script attempts to correct permissions on .hplip files in users home directories. These files were sometimes created with root permissions leading to crashes in hp-toolbox. The script tries to fix this by changing the ownership of the files to the user.
- **Ignoring Errors:** The script ignored errors during the permission correction process which means that problems would go unnoticed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Modification:** A local attacker could exploit the shell injection vulnerability in the script to change the ownership and potentially the permissions of arbitrary files on the system during an `hplip` installation or upgrade.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying system files, an attacker could potentially gain root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires local access to the system.
- **`apt-get upgrade`:** The vulnerability is triggered by an upgrade of the `hplip` package using `apt-get upgrade`.
- **Specific File Creation**: The vulnerability is also triggered by creating a file called `.hplip` in the directory where the user runs the upgrade command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to install/upgrade packages on the system.
- The attacker does not need root privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Ubuntu Gutsy (7.10).
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the problematic code from the `hplip.postinst` script in the updated package versions.
- The `hplip` package in Gutsy was fixed in version `2.7.7.dfsg.1-0ubuntu5.3`.
