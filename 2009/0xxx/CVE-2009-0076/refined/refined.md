- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specifically when processing a CSS stylesheet containing a specific combination of style directives, one of which must be 'zoom' in XHTML strict mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The flawed CSS processing leads to memory corruption, which can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine within the context of the logged-on user.
- **Full System Control (with Admin Rights):** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:**
    - The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted web page designed to trigger the vulnerability.
    - Attackers can host malicious websites or compromise legitimate ones to serve this exploit.
    - Malicious content can also be served through advertisements or other methods to deliver web content.
- **User Interaction Required:**
     - Exploitation requires the user to visit a malicious web page. Attackers will need to convince users to visit the malicious page, typically via links in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via a web server and does not require any prior access to the victim's machine.
- **Crafted Web Content:** The attacker needs the ability to create and host a specially crafted web page containing malicious CSS that can trigger the vulnerability
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to use some form of social engineering to lure the user to visit the malicious website

**Additional details**
- The vulnerability affects only Internet Explorer 7
-  Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited, making it a likely target for future attacks
