- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the authentication mechanism of MyDesing Sayac v2.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection, which allows bypassing the authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication and gain access to the administrative panel.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited through the login form at `/admin/admin.asp` (or `/PATH/admin`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or positions are required. The provided exploit suggests using the username and password `'or'`.
