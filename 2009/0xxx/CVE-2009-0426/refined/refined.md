Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0426:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `upload_image_category.asp` script in DMXReady Classified Listings Manager is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cid` parameter.

**Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input (`cid` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.

**Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `upload_image_category.asp` with a maliciously crafted `cid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or position within the network is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code to:

*   Retrieve sensitive information from the database (e.g., usernames and passwords)
*   Modify data within the database
*   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the server, if the database user has high privileges.
    
**Technical Details:**
The exploit example given shows how to extract the username (`Security_AdminUserName`) and password (`Security_AdminPassword`) from the `tblCLM_config` table using `UNION SELECT` SQL injection.

```
USERNAME->
/admin/ClassifiedListingsManager/components/CategoryManager/upload_image_category.asp?cid=5 union select 0,Security_AdminUserName,2,5,9,3 from tblCLM_config

PASSWORD->
///admin/ClassifiedListingsManager/components/CategoryManager/upload_image_category.asp?cid=5 union select 0,Security_AdminPassword,2,5,9,3 from tblCLM_config
```
