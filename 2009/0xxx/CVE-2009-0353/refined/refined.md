  "CVE-2009-0353": {
    "description": "Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A stability bug in the browser engine, specifically within the javascript engine, which can lead to memory corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption",
        "Potential arbitrary code execution"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker may be able to cause a crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by triggering the memory corruption vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting and serving malicious web content",
        "By exploiting a vulnerability through JavaScript execution"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to serve the malicious web content to the victim or exploit a vulnerability through JavaScript execution. No specific privileges or access is explicitly required to exploit this vulnerability."
