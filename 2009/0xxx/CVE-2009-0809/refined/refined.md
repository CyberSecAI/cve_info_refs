Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the web editor component of IBM SMARTEAM. Specifically, the issue is that the web editor does not properly check user permissions when accessing objects via a URL, sent via email, allowing unauthorized users to view object profile cards

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the web editor's failure to enforce access control on object profile cards when accessed through a URL link. Despite user 'bob' not having permission to view the document class, the link from the email allowed access to the profile card.
- **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability leads to information disclosure as an unauthorized user can view the profile card of an object that they should not have access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Access:** An unauthorized user (e.g., Bob) can view the profile card of an object, exposing potentially sensitive information.
- **Potential further attacks:** Although not mentioned, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone for further attacks, e.g. a user knowing an object exist, might try to exploit other weaknesses to access it.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email Link:** The attack vector involves an authorized user (e.g., Joe) sending a link to an object via email to an unauthorized user (e.g., Bob).
- **Web Browser:** The unauthorized user must click on the link in the email using a web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authorized User Action:** The attacker requires the cooperation of an authorized user (e.g., Joe) who has access to the object. This user must email a link to the target object.
- **Email Access:** The unauthorized user (e.g., Bob) needs access to an email containing the specially crafted link.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to access the profile cards of objects they should not have permission to view, by exploiting a flaw in how access is checked when using URLs generated by the email function in the SMARTEAM web editor.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is identified by APAR number HD80332.
- The vulnerability will be fixed in SMARTEAM Version 5 Release 18 SP08.
- The issue was submitted on 2008-12-03 and closed on 2009-01-15.
