        "content": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in gmetad's `process_path()` function. A char array `element[256]` is allocated on the stack to store path elements during processing. If a request is made with a path element longer than 256 bytes, the strncpy call will write to an invalid memory location, causing a crash. The fix involves dynamically allocating the memory for element using malloc based on the actual size of the path element, with a size limit enforced by REQUESTLEN.  Additionally, a denial of service could be achieved by sending many requests with nonexistent paths, resulting in high CPU usage or large amounts of data being transferred. The proposed solution is to log an error and bail out for both malformed and nonexistent requests.",
