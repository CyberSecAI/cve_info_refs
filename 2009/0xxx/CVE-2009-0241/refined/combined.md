How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Spike Spiegel](/search?l=ganglia-developers@lists.sourceforge.net&q=from:%22Spike+Spiegel%22)
[Tue, 13 Jan 2009 07:42:07 -0800](/search?l=ganglia-developers@lists.sourceforge.net&q=date:20090113)

```
Hi,

I wanted to add a feature to gmetad so that it was possible to request multiple
items per connection on the interactive port, and while doing so I
uncovered a buffer overflow that
crashes the gmetad server. I'm releasing both patches together because they
are somewhat connected. Apologies if this is a problem and for the length of my
email, the intent is to make it easier for reviewers but it might trigger
brain filters.
```
```

== Multiple requests per connection on interactive port
We wanted to leverage ganglia to develop complex checks that rely on
correlating various metrics over several hosts. With a large tree the best way
to achieve that is by using the interactive port to request those specific
metrics, but this incurred in a large number of connections given the limit of
one item per request. The proposed patch removes this limit.

I've picked up ':' as a separator since it's the natural one under Unix and
wasn't included in the string process_request() checks against to
sanitize input.

To limit the changeset I've reused the existing code and simply wrapped
process_path in a do while loop that splits the request in chunks and pass them
to the function. As a side effect this happens:
if you request something like
/grid1/host1/load_one:/grid1/host1/load_five you'll
get two times the grid and host xml tags rather than one grid/host tag with
the two metrics merged inside. While at a first glance this looks ugly there
are imho a bunch of things to consider:

1) doing the merge server side is a lot of work and a big changeset afaics.
2) I would argue that it's actually correct to not merge because you've
requested for /grid/host/metric so you effectively get what you asked for.
3) Most likely on the client the processing will be done with a XML library
resulting in something similar to res[grid][host] = val , which
would make the merge fairly easy (at least in higher level languages like
python).

As to filters support, it is potentially a problem for multiple items per
request, but as it is I don't see any. Right now there's only support for a
SUMMARY filter which will only be applied to root/grid/cluster nodes and output
"<HOSTS UP=\"%u\" DOWN=\"%u\" SOURCE=\"gmetad\"/>". Being that the case with a
request like "/grid1:/grid2?filter=summary" each grid will get its own summary
which is the expected behavior. Nonetheless I wanted to point it out because in
case more filters are added this would need to be accounted for.

== Gmetad server buffer overflow and network overload
These problems exist regardless of the above feature but would get far worse in
that case, hence being linked.

=== Buffer overflow
It is possible to instantly crash gmetad by crafting a special request to be
sent to the interactive port.

In process_path() a char element[256] is allocated to contain the pieces of the
path as it is processed. If a request is made with a path element longer than
that the strncpy call will write to invalid memory location, since there is no
length checking performed on the input data to make sure it is less than the
size of element.

Fix is provided by malloc'ing the right size to accommodate any element's
length. REQUESTLEN provides protection against abusing malloc and launching a
memory exhaustion attack.

PoC: echo "/`python -c \"print \\"%s/%s\\" % ('a'*300,'b'*300)\"`" |
nc localhost 8652

=== DoS attacks
1) Given REQUESTLEN=2048, and 3 characters to be the minimum to craft a valid
and nonexistent path "/x", with the above feature implemented it would be
possible to trigger 2048/3 calls to process_path which would possibly lead to
CPU overload.
2) extension to 1) - as it is ganglia returns the entire tree if an element is
not found. with large trees 2048/3 requests could easily result in several GBs
of data being transferred. Related to this if you look at gmetad/server.c lines
601:606 you'll see this:
                     err_msg("Got a malformed path request from %s", remote_ip);
                     /* Send them the entire tree to discourage attacks. */
                     strcpy(request, "/");
which leads to the same scenario as above.

What I propose is that for both cases, malformed request and non existent
items, we log an error and bail out. This would solve 2) and most of 1) making
the call possibly exist far quicker.

== Patches summary
- server-c-bof-dos.diff , address buffer overflow and network DoS
- server-c-multi-item-request.diff , add the multi item per request feature

I have a version available that does not use strsep if you think that's
preferable, but it's a bit more code and strsep shouldn't be a dependency
problem even on not-so-new systems.

regards,

Spike

# Ganglia: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200903-22**

A buffer-overflow in Ganglia's gmetad might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-cluster/ganglia** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.1-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.1-r2** |

### Background

Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for clusters and
grids.

### Description

Spike Spiegel reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
process\_path() function when processing overly long pathnames in
gmetad/server.c.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to the gmetad
service leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of
Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ganglia users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-cluster/ganglia-3.1.1-r2"
```

| [Description](#c0)  squeeze    2002-05-07 17:07:54 UTC  ``` I hope I'm not confused or anything here but I spend some time looking into the FHS specifications. If found one interesting part about /var/cache. It states:  ... The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. Unlike /var/spool, the cached files can be deleted without data loss. ...  I haven't found a tool that can regenerate the virtual file and it seems like /var/db/pkg/virtual/ isn't used anymore (not on my system anyway 1.1a). The world file can be regenerated but the tool doesn't exist in portage. The "worldsync" tool will add ALL non system packages which may not be true for the old world file.  Well any sane user shouldn't delete the edb directory but the FHS spec. says it's ok to do so and the app should regenerate the deleted files.  Are my teories totaly wrong? Have I misunderstood how the edb files are working? Is Gentoo not FHS compliant? ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sandy McArthur    2002-06-10 00:16:06 UTC  ``` On a similar note if you delete /var/cache/edb you get errors like:  Calculating world dependencies \Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/bin/emerge", line 1278, in ?     mydepgraph.syscreate(getworldlist())   File "/usr/bin/emerge", line 481, in syscreate     self.create(self.match(myline,mykey="update (likely old /var/db/pkg entry)"))   File "/usr/bin/emerge", line 400, in create     mydb=open(mydbkey,"r") IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/cache/edb/dep/dep-man-pages-1.50.ebuild'  The workaround is to run `mkdir -p /var/cache/edb/dep`. It would be nice if portage did that for you. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-12-09 13:20:17 UTC  ``` some stuff in /var/cache really belongs somewhere else. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2003-11-21 11:25:32 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 34035](show_bug.cgi?id=34035 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - portage use of /var/cache is not FHS compliant") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2004-05-06 17:48:23 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 50200](show_bug.cgi?id=50200 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - FHS 2.3 requires /usr/portage -> /var/lib/portage, /usr/local/portage -> /etc/portage, /usr/portage/distfiles -> /var/cache/portage") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Nicholas Jones (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-16 03:55:01 UTC  ``` All major FHS issues should be dealt with in portage-2.0.51  /var/cache/edb can be deleted at will. It's actually cache data now.  /var/lib/portage contains state data & world file  ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Brian Harring (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-09-15 08:09:32 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 64140](show_bug.cgi?id=64140 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - /var/cache/edb/world and virtuals don't comply with Linux FHS") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Nicholas Jones (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-10-22 08:47:54 UTC  ``` Bug has been fixed and released in stable portages on or before 2.0.51-r2 ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  John Nilsson    2005-03-28 12:24:38 UTC  ``` As every bug on portage and FHS seems to be marked duplicate to this i'll comment here.  I've searched gentoo-dev and bugs.gentoo.org but I can't seem to find a solid debate regarding DISTDIR and PKGDIR with regards to the FHS.  Is there a conclusion somewhere that I've missed?  With regards to the ideas discussed in <http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-2218914.html> maybe the default location of these should change.  DISTDIR =======  /var/cache ---------- It could be regarded as cached data but I'm uncertain if downloadable fits within "Such data is locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation."  /usr/src --------  "Source code may be place placed in this subdirectory, only for reference purposes." This seems like an intuitive place to look for such data, but this only holds true for installed applications.   /usr/share ---------- This is the place to put data meant to be shared between hosts in a heterogenous network, which very much describes this data (this also describes the current portage tree it self, but something tells me this will change in the future). However the FHS makes it clear that /usr  is read only data that must not be written to and should not vary over time, probably to address fragmentation issues so /var seems more sensible.   PKGDIR ======  This is certainly "locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation." so /var/cache is clearly the right choice. ``` |  |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- IBMJava5-JRE/java-1\_5\_0-ibm
The update brings IBM Java 5 to SR9-SSU.
It fixes a lot of security issues:
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space resulting
in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may be
leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack to
access other applications listening on ports other than the one where
the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with
initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client to
cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP client
implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server to cause
malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and trick
a user into trusting the applet.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet
may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted
applet.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an
untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java
Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.

function has been fixed. CVE-2009-0241 has
been assigned to this issue.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- ghostscript-devel
Specially crafted file could cause a heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder
(CVE-2009-0196), an integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792),
a buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module (CVE-2008-6679) or crash
the CCITTFax decoder (CVE-2007-6725).
The previous security update introduced a regression that broke some
printer drives. This new update fixes that issue.
Affected products: NLD9, SLES9, OES, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libwmf

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
