  "CVE-2009-0747": {
    "description": "The ext4_isize function in fs/ext4/ext4.h in the Linux kernel 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.19 and 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7 uses the i_size_high structure member during operations on arbitrary types of files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and error-message flood) by attempting to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ext4_isize` function uses the `i_size_high` structure member without proper validation during operations on arbitrary files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Use of potentially invalid structure member"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service, characterized by high CPU consumption and excessive error message output.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Mounting a crafted ext4 filesystem"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user"
    },
    "affected_systems": [
      "Linux kernel 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.19",
      "Linux kernel 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7",
       "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (fixed via RHSA-2009:1243)"
     ,
        "Debian Linux (fixed in version 2.6.26-13lenny2)"
    ],
        "additional_notes": "This vulnerability allows a local user to mount a specially crafted ext4 filesystem that triggers a loop in the `ext4_isize()` function, leading to denial of service."
