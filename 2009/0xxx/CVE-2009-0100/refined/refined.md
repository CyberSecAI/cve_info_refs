Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office Excel parses the Excel spreadsheet file format, specifically when handling a malformed object within a specially crafted Excel file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper parsing of malformed objects in Excel files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, especially if the user has administrative privileges.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Excel file as an email attachment and trick the user into opening it.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious Excel files on websites and convince users to visit the site and open the file. Compromised websites or those accepting user content can also host such files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Excel file with a malformed object.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the victim via email or a website.
- The attacker must convince the victim to open the malicious Excel file.

**Additional details:**

- The document mentions that Microsoft Excel 2000 is particularly vulnerable because it doesn't have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document, making the exploitation more direct.
- The document also notes that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed when the security bulletin was initially released.
- It also mentions that Microsoft had not received any reports of this vulnerability being exploited at the time of the bulletin's original release.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Microsoft Office Excel opens these specially crafted files.
- Workarounds include using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) and Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent opening files from untrusted sources.
