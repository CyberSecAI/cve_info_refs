## [Agavi 0.11.6 released, fixes vulnerability](https://blog.agavi.org/post/75829956/agavi-0116-released-fixes-vulnerability)

Agavi 0.11.6 is now available for download at [www.agavi.org](http://www.agavi.org/)

This maintenance release fixes a number of issues and provides several minor enhancements and additions.

Most importantly, this release fixes an attack vector affecting AgaviWebRouting::gen(null) in combination with some web browsers that (in violation of RFC 3986 and earlier versions) do not urlencode certain characters in the URL when making requests to a web server, allowing attackers to craft potentially malicious URLs that lead to a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability. Current and previous versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer are known to exhibit this behavior. We’d like to thank Daniel Kubitza for advising us of this issue.

Please see the associated [ticket #1019](http://trac.agavi.org/ticket/1019) for details, temporary workarounds and standalone patches against previous releases.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name [CVE-2009-0417](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0417) to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the [CVE list](http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for security problems.

As it also fixes a couple of bugs related to handling of request data and validation, upgrading is highly recommended for all users.

A couple of changes over 0.11.5 are worth mentioning:

* AgaviArraylengthValidator was added.
* PHP 5.2.8 or later is now required in combination with magic\_quotes\_gpc. This is due to security reasons unrelated to the issue in the PHP 5.2.7 release. [Ticket #953](http://trac.agavi.org/ticket/953) explains things in detail.
* Slot responses are now merged into the parent even if the response content is empty.
* Several best practices have been added and improved in the sample app and the code templates, and warnings are now thrown for outdated libxml versions, all intended to make it easier for new users to dive into Agavi.
* The timezone database was updated to version 2009a.
* Access to global request data is now locked during AgaviAction::getDefaultViewName() execution.
* Handling of array keys has been unified across AgaviWebRequestDataHolder sources.
* Unvalidated request data is not available anymore in the View if the Action didn’t serve the current request method.
* New projects now generate separate exception templates for production environments, and the built-in exception templates now simply re-throw the exception instead of displaying any information if the display\_errors php.ini setting is disabled.
* ‘secure’ flags can optionally be set automatically on session and response cookies, and the session save path can be defined for AgaviSessionStorage through factories.xml. These measures are useful for mitigating potential attack vectors on applications.

## [Agavi 1.0.0 beta 8 released, fixes vulnerability](https://blog.agavi.org/post/75830918/agavi-100-beta-8-released-fixes-vulnerability)

Agavi 1.0.0 beta 8 is now available for download at [www.agavi.org](http://www.agavi.org/)

This release fixes a number of issues and introduces a bunch of new features and enhancements over beta 7.

Most importantly, this release fixes an attack vector affecting AgaviWebRouting::gen(null) in combination with some web browsers that (in violation of RFC 3986 and earlier versions) do not urlencode certain characters in the URL when making requests to a web server, allowing attackers to craft potentially malicious URLs that lead to a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability. Current and previous versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer are known to exhibit this behavior. We’d like to thank Daniel Kubitza for advising us of this issue.

Please see the associated [ticket #1019](http://trac.agavi.org/ticket/1019) for details, temporary workarounds and standalone patches against previous releases.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name [CVE-2009-0417](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0417) to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the [CVE list](http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for security problems.

As it also fixes a couple of bugs related to handling of request data and validation, upgrading is highly recommended for all users.

A couple of enhancements and changes over 1.0.0 beta 7 are worth mentioning:

* A brand new Routing implementation (backwards compatible)
* The move to the new XML config system is officially finished; AgaviReturnArrayConfigHandler remains an old-style handler for the time being
* Complete support for multiple SOAP services in the same application
* Command line support (request/response/routing)
* Support for anti-stampede callbacks in Execution Filter
* AgaviController::dispatch() accepts an AgaviExecutionContainer as optional second argument
* Sample App was refactored completely and got some enhancements
* Support for arbitrary HTTP POST Content Types
* Automatically decode HTTP PUT payload into request parameters for application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Type in AgaviWebRequest
* Allow relative min and max values using strtotime syntax in AgaviDateTimeValidator
* Throw named error if “required” condition is not satisfied in validators
* Streamline date formatting and parsing behaviors when using timezones

Of course, all of the enhancements, changes and fixes from the [latest 0.11.6 release](http://blog.agavi.org/post/75829956/agavi-0-11-6-released-fixes-vulnerability) are also in this release. We have recently updated our CHANGELOG structure to list changes merged from older version branches under the destination version, so you can quickly get a precise overview of what changes exactly are included in a release.

For a full list of changes and descriptions of important changes, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](http://trac.agavi.org/browser/tags/1.0.0beta8/CHANGELOG) and [RELEASE\_NOTES](http://trac.agavi.org/browser/tags/1.0.0beta8/RELEASE_NOTES).

We will roll another beta this week with a very, very sexy new validation report query API. Once that is done, Agavi 1.0 will be feature complete, and we can start the release candidate cycle.
