Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in two issues within the S-CMS 1.1 Stable application:

1.  **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application sets a cookie named "login" with the value "OK" upon successful login. Critically, this cookie is set without proper security measures and is not tied to a specific session or user, which can be easily spoofed.
2.  **SQL Injection in `delete_page.php`:** The `delete_page.php` script uses a direct SQL query with user-supplied input from the `id` parameter without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The insecure cookie handling allows an attacker to bypass the login process by manually setting a `login=OK` cookie via JavaScript.
*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerable `delete_page.php` script is susceptible to SQL injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the application by bypassing authentication using the insecure cookie.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Through the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can delete data from the `cms_content` table, or potentially modify or extract other data from the database. This could lead to complete compromise of the site.
*   **Mass Page Deletion:** By manipulating the SQL query in the `delete_page.php`, an attacker can delete multiple pages or all pages through a `1=1` condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Cookie Spoofing:** The attacker sets the `login=OK` cookie, bypassing authentication.
2.  **HTTP Request to `delete_page.php`:** An attacker sends a request to `delete_page.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter to inject SQL commands

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Browser with JavaScript Support:** For the cookie spoofing part of the attack, the attacker needs a browser that can run JavaScript to set a cookie.
*   **Knowledge of the Application's Structure:** The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable scripts (e.g., `/admin/delete_page.php`).
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** needed to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content is more detailed than a basic CVE description, detailing vulnerable files, code snippets, and a concise exploit scenario.
*   The exploit involves two steps: first, bypassing authentication by setting the cookie, and second, exploiting the SQL injection to delete data.
*   The exploit demonstrates how an attacker can achieve mass deletion of pages using the SQL Injection Vulnerability.
* The code snippet provided for login action only pulls the last username and password from the cms_admin table which could potentially also be considered a separate bug on it's own.
