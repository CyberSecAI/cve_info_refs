Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the screen saver in Mac OS X versions 10.5 through 10.5.7 did not block four-finger Multi-Touch gestures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient input handling by the screen saver when activated. It failed to block specific user input (four-finger Multi-Touch gestures).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A person with physical access to a locked system could use the four-finger Multi-Touch gestures to manage applications or use Expose, bypassing the screen lock. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over the system and its applications, as well as the potential for unauthorized data access.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is physical access. An attacker needs to be physically present at the computer to interact with the Multi-Touch trackpad.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker requires physical access to the targeted system. They do not need any special privileges or software. They simply need to be able to physically interact with the Multi-Touch trackpad while the screensaver is active.
