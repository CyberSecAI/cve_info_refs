Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1372

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: Decompressing maliciously crafted data may lead to an unexpected application termination

  Description: An out-of-bounds memory access exists in bzip2. Opening a maliciously crafted compressed file may lead to an unexpected application termination. This update addresses the issue by updating bzip2 to version 1.0.5. Further information is available via the bzip2 web site at <http://bzip.org/>

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1723

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may control the displayed website URL in a certificate warning

  Description: When Safari reaches a website via a 302 redirection and a certificate warning is displayed, the warning will contain the original website URL instead of the current website URL. This may allow a maliciously crafted website that is reached via an open redirector on a user-trusted website to control the displayed website URL in a certificate warning. This issue was addressed by returning the correct URL in the underlying CFNetwork layer. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Kevin Day of Your.Org, and Jason Mueller of Indiana University for reporting this issue.

* **ColorSync**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1726

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted image with an embedded ColorSync profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of images with an embedded ColorSync profile. Opening a maliciously crafted image with an embedded ColorSync profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of ColorSync profiles. Credit to Chris Evans of the Google Security Team for reporting this issue.

* **CoreTypes**

  Impact: Users are not warned before opening certain potentially unsafe content types

  Description: This update extends the system's list of content types that will be flagged as potentially unsafe under certain circumstances, such as when they are downloaded from a web page. While these content types are not automatically launched, if manually opened they could lead to the execution of a malicious JavaScript payload. This update improves the system's ability to notify users before handling content types used by Safari. Credit to Brian Mastenbrook, and Clint Ruoho of Laconic Security for reporting this issue.

* **Dock**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0151
