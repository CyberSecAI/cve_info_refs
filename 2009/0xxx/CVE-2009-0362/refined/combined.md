Subject: fail2ban: Included wuftpd.conf matches reverse DNS rather than IP
Date: Wed, 4 Feb 2009 19:56:16 +0000
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=514163;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: fail2ban
Version: 0.7.5-2etch1
Severity: normal

The '/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/wuftpd.conf' file shipped in the package
contains a regex which matches the error message generated by PAM:

failregex = wu-ftpd(?:\[\d+\])?:\s+\(pam_unix\)\s+authentication failure.* rhost=<HOST>$

The problem is that the value of 'rhost' is the resolved reverse DNS entry
for the remote host. Also, fail2ban's checking of the <HOST> entry stops
after it finds a valid IP address. I noticed this thanks to the following
log entries:

 (pam_unix) authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty= ruser= rhost=26.232.125.75.gs.dynamic.163data.com.cn

That reverse DNS entry actually comes from 125.75.232.26, but fail2ban took
the beginning of that string and banned the IP address 26.232.125.75.

The attached patch changes the regexp to one that matches the log message
generated by wu-ftpd itself, which contains the unresolved IP address of the
remote host. Note that this message is by default written to syslog and not
auth.log.

O man,

THANKS!

let me postpone dealing with wuftpd for now... just the issue of IP
that is bad... it is a security hazard and makes it easy to perform DoS
attacks... forwarding it upstream.

To replicate it in a matter of seconds, try

fail2ban-regex "Feb  4 14:55:01 washoe CRON[679]: (pam_unix) authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty= ruser= rhost=26.232.125.75.gs.dynamic.163data.com.cn" "\s+\(pam_unix\)\s+authentication failure.* rhost=<HOST>$"

proper IP should be 218.241.97.60 not 26.232.125.75

Tentative fix is in my git repository:

<http://git.onerussian.com/?p=deb/fail2ban.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/up/fix_searchIP>

it is as simple as attached patch

there are two commits though -- 1 is actual fix, 1 is added a unittest for it.

If Cyril confirms that indeed it is that bad,  I will immediately raise
the severity of the bug.  If Cyril agrees on my fix (it needs proper
testing), I will upload a debian package and seek for ability to upload
it into lenny (and etch), since it is RC

btw -- Cyril, am I doing smth wrong or unittests battery is not
maintained? ;)

running
PYTHONPATH=. ./fail2ban-testcases

gives me
FAILED (failures=3, errors=4)

so, to run only my unittest you can use nosetests and run from testcases
directory:

PYTHONPATH=.. nosetests -s filtertestcase:DNSUtilsTests
