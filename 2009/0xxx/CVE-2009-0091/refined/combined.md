# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-061 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in the Microsoft .NET Common Language Runtime Could Allow Remote Code Execution (974378)

Published: October 13, 2009 | Updated: June 22, 2010

**Version:** 1.4

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on a client system if a user views a specially crafted Web page using a Web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs) or Silverlight applications, or if an attacker succeeds in persuading a user to run a specially crafted Microsoft .NET application. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. The vulnerabilities could also allow remote code execution on a server system running IIS, if that server allows processing ASP.NET pages and an attacker succeeds in uploading a specially crafted ASP.NET page to that server and executing it, as could be the case in a Web hosting scenario. Microsoft .NET applications, Silverlight applications, XBAPs and ASP.NET pages that are not malicious are not at risk of being compromised because of this vulnerability.

This security update is rated Critical for all affected editions of the Microsoft .NET Framework on Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista; Microsoft Silverlight 2 when installed on Mac; and Microsoft Silverlight 2 when installed on all releases of Microsoft Windows clients.

This security update is rated Important for all affected editions of the Microsoft .NET Framework on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.

This security update is rated Moderate for Microsoft Silverlight 2 when installed on all releases of Microsoft Windows servers.

For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way in which the Microsoft .NET verifies and enforces the rules of Microsoft .NET verifiable code and by modifying the way in which the Microsoft .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) handles interfaces. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow a malicious Microsoft .NET application to obtain a managed pointer to stack memory that is no longer used. The malicious Microsoft .NET application could then use this pointer to modify legitimate values placed at that stack location later, leading to arbitrary unmanaged code execution. Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0090](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0090).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.
* In a Web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a Web site and ASP.NET must be installed on that Web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode mitigates this vulnerability only in a Web-based attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 8 disables the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone. This feature of Internet Explorer 8 makes successful exploitation of this vulnerability more difficult by blocking a known technique for bypassing ASLR and DEP protection. Disabling the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone does not make it impossible to exploit this vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8, but it does make it more difficult for malicious Web sites to reliably exploit it.
* In a Web-browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. Users or accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users or accounts that operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable partially trusted Microsoft .NET applications**

  To disable all Microsoft .NET applications running at partial trust, including XAML browser applications (XBAPs) and Microsoft .NET applications located on the network, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetlockdowncaspol -pp on`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** Some Microsoft .NET applications will not run.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To reset the Microsoft .NET security policies to the defaults, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetcaspol -pp on`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to undo this workaround.
* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones.

  1. **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.

#### FAQ for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability in either the context of the currently logged on user, or in the context of the service account associated with an application pool identity.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability results from the manner in which Microsoft .NET verifiable code is verified.

**What is the CLR?**

The Microsoft .NET Framework provides a run-time environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier. For more information about the CLR, see [Common Language Runtime Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ddk909ch%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What is an XBAP?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a Web application and a rich-client application. Like Web applications, XBAPs can be published to a Web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes and no. For the Web browsing attack scenario, running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 mitigates the vulnerability, but for the Web hosting and .NET Application attack scenario, these platforms do not mitigate the vulnerability. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In the Web hosting scenario, an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the service account associated with the application pool identity of the application pool that a Microsoft .NET application is running under. Depending on application pool isolation configuration and permissions granted to the service account, an attacker might be able to take control over other application pools on the Web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system. For more information about application pool identities and configuration, see [Configure Application Pool Identity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc781986%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three scenarios possible for exploitation of this vulnerability: a Web browsing scenario, a Web hosting scenario, and a Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario. These scenarios are described below.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  If a Web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker user could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario**

  An attacker could place a malicious Microsoft .NET Framework application on a network share and convince users on that network to execute this application.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described below: systems that are using the Web browsing scenario, and systems that are using the Web hosting scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting Web sites using a Web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a Web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.

**I have written a Microsoft .NET application. Do I need to recompile it?**

Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability and do not need to be recompiled. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update modifies the way in which the Microsoft .NET Framework verifies and enforces the rules of Microsoft .NET verifiable code.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Microsoft .NET Framework Type Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0091

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow a malicious Microsoft .NET application to bypass a type equality check. The malicious Microsoft .NET application could exploit this vulnerability by casting an object of one type into another type, leading to arbitrary unmanaged code execution. Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0091](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0091).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft .NET Framework Type Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0091

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.
* In a Web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a Web site and ASP.NET must be installed on that Web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode mitigates this vulnerability only in a Web-based attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 8 disables the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone. This feature of Internet Explorer 8 makes successful exploitation of this vulnerability more difficult by blocking a known technique for bypassing ASLR and DEP protection. Disabling the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone does not make it impossible to exploit this vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8, but it does make it more difficult for malicious Web sites to reliably exploit it.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. Users or accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users or accounts that operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft .NET Framework Type Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0091

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable partially trusted Microsoft .NET applications**

  To disable all Microsoft .NET applications running at partial trust, including XAML browser applications (XBAPs) and Microsoft .NET applications located on the network, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetlockdowncaspol -pp on`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** Some Microsoft .NET applications will not run.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  1. **Tools** menu and then select **Manage Add-ons**.
  2. **Microsoft Silverlight**, click **Enable**, and then click **OK**.
* **Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{DFEAF541-F3E1-4C24-ACAC-99C30715084A}]

  Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications and Web sites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described below: systems that are using the Web browsing scenario, and systems that are using the Web hosting scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting Web sites using a Web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs or Silverlight applications. Therefore, any systems where a Web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes and no. For the Web browsing attack scenario, running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 mitigates the vulnerability, but for the Web hosting and Microsoft .NET application attack scenario, these platforms do not mitigate the vulnerability. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**I have written a Microsoft .NET application or a Silverlight application. Do I need to recompile it?**

Microsoft .NET applications and Silverlight applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability and do not need to be recompiled. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update modifies the way in which the Microsoft .NET CLR handles interfaces.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-2497](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2497).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Note for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB974417)** When you install this security update, the installer checks whether the product or component being updated has previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the LDR (or QFE) version of the files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the GDR version of the files to your system. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960043](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960043).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

**Reference Table**

The following table contains the security update information for this software. You can find additional information in the subsection, **Deployment Information**, in this section.

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses.

**Note for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB974417)** When you install this security update, the installer checks whether the product or component being updated has previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the LDR (or QFE) version of the files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the GDR version of the files to your system. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960043](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960043).

For more information about the installer, visit the [MSDN Web site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa367988%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)
