{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the index used to access the 'arguments' array of a JavaScript function in Safari.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The index into the 'arguments' array is cast to a signed value before being compared to the array's length. This allows for a negative index by providing a large integer value (greater than 0x80000000) which bypasses the bounds check. Additionally, the index is multiplied by 4 without overflow checks, allowing access to arbitrary memory locations.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary memory read/write, leading to denial of service (crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution if combined with suitable shellcode.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted JavaScript code within a webpage.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious webpage to a Safari user."
