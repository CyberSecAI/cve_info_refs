{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Transparent proxy servers make connection decisions based on HTTP header values (specifically the Host header), rather than the source and destination IP addresses. This allows an attacker to forge HTTP headers and potentially relay connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper reliance on HTTP headers for connection decisions in transparent proxy servers.",
      "Lack of validation of HTTP Host header against the actual destination IP address.",
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially make connections to any website or resource that the proxy can access. This includes internal resources like intranet sites that are normally not exposed to the internet.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can forge HTTP headers via active content (e.g., Flash, Java) within a web browser. This can be achieved by either convincing a user to visit a malicious page or by loading malicious active content on a trusted site.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to inject active content into a web page that a user will visit.  This could be achieved through a malicious website or by compromising a legitimate site with the ability to load the attacker's content. The attacker does not need access to cookies or other authentication credentials as the attack vector exploits the transparent proxy and does not rely on user-specific sessions.  They need to be able to forge HTTP Host headers."
