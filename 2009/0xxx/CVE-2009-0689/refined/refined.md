  "CVE-2009-0689": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow exists in the floating point binary to text conversion code within Libsystem. An attacker who can cause an application to convert a floating point value into a long string, or to parse a maliciously crafted string as a floating point value, may be able to cause an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.",
