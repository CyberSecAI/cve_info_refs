## Synopsis

Critical: php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0312)

## Topic

Updated php packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 and 5.6 Long Life, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
5.9 Extended Update Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way PHP parsed floating point
numbers from their text representation. If a PHP application converted
untrusted input strings to numbers, an attacker able to provide such input
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the application. (CVE-2009-0689)

All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the
updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Hash: SHA512

Package        : mono
Version        : 3.2.8+dfsg-10+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-0689

It was found that Mono’s string-to-double parser may crash, on
specially crafted input. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2018-1002208: Mono embeds the sharplibzip library which is
vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing attackers to write to
arbitrary files via a ../ (dot dot slash) in a Zip archive entry that
is mishandled during extraction. This vulnerability is also known as
'Zip-Slip'.

The Mono developers intend to entirely remove sharplibzip from the
sources and do not plan to fix this issue. It is therefore recommended
to fetch the latest sharplibzip version by using the nuget package
manager instead. The embedded version should not be used with
untrusted zip files.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
3.2.8+dfsg-10+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mono packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- mozilla-nspr
This update fixes a bug in the Mozilla NSPR helper libraries, which could
be used by remote attackers to potentially execute code via javascript
vectors.
MFSA 2009-59:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the execution
of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus be leveraged by
the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
CVE-2009-1563: CVSS v2 Base Score: 10.0 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0-11.1, SLE10, SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-915-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

18 March 2010

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-0689](/security/CVE-2009-0689), [CVE-2009-2463](/security/CVE-2009-2463), [CVE-2009-3075](/security/CVE-2009-3075))

Josh Soref discovered that the BinHex decoder used in Thunderbird contained

a flaw. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3072](/security/CVE-2009-3072))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly manage memory when

using XUL tree elements. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-3077](/security/CVE-2009-3077))

Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm discovered that Thunderbird did not properly

display filenames containing right-to-left (RTL) override characters. If a

user were tricked into opening a malicious file with a crafted filename, an

attacker could exploit this to trick the user into opening a different file

than the user expected. ([CVE-2009-3376](/security/CVE-2009-3376))

Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in

Thunderbird. If an NTLM authenticated user opened content containing links

to a malicious website, a remote attacker could send requests to other

applications, authenticated as the user. ([CVE-2009-3983](/security/CVE-2009-3983))

Ludovic Hirlimann discovered a flaw in the way Thunderbird indexed certain

messages with attachments. A remote attacker could send specially crafted

content and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0163](/security/CVE-2010-0163))

[split from [bug 516396](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)")]
Secunia notified security@ of a problem in nsprpub/pr/src/misc/prdtoa.c's Balloc() function. The same issue also occurs in js/src/dtoa.c, so the patch from [bug 416396](/show_bug.cgi?id=416396 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox doesn't install Flash plugin when it is needed and absent") needs to be ported to that copy of dtoa.Flags: blocking1.9.2?Flags: blocking1.9.0.15?

I ported wtc's patch in [bug 516396](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") to the copy js uses.
I did a diff between the two files, and there are a lot of differences, mostly in casting, but there are some code changes as well...Assignee: general → reedStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Thanks, reed... You may want/need a proper js peer for this, too. But it looks good to me.

They appear to be testing this bug. They turned what appeared to be a hang into an outright immediate crash. Slightly different places, I'm not sure I'm happy with either.

I actually created an NSPR test case for this bug, but
it took too long to finish, so I can't add it to the
NSPR test suite.
Should we consider failing early if the input string
is too long?

Al, I don't have a test case for this JavaScript bug.
Reed's test case in NSPR [bug 516396 comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") is actually
a test case for this bug. You can use Reed's test case
to verify this bug is fixed.

Al: the hang is expected. Firefox doesn't really hang; that
test case causes Firefox to take a very long time to convert
the string to a double.
I have an NSPR patch in [bug 516396 comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c41 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") to address
the hang. You may want a similar patch for JavaScript.

Not sure how you can verify something that isn't completely fixed yet. We need to port the second patch from the NSPR version of this bug over to js.

Note: |err| is not set by JS\_strtod correctly on return. You need
to do this:
LOCK\_DTOA();
+ errno = 0;
retval = \_strtod(s00, se);
+ if (err) {
+ switch (errno) {
+ case ERANGE:
+ \*err = JS\_DTOA\_ERANGE;

UNLOCK\_DTOA();

I was marking it "fixed" based on the comment that the hang without a crash was expected.
We're most of a week past code complete now and cutting builds within the new week. If your patch doesn't get checked in Reed, this is going to ship as it is now.
So, everyone, is the current behavior acceptable and "fixed" or not? If not, perhaps we need to back the whole thing out rather than ship half of a fix?
Dveditz, any comments?

Al: the hang does not allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code,
so don't back out what's checked in.

Good point. It isn't my call anyway. It is up to Dveditz and Beltzner to make the call. The question is whether we need Reed's patch or not. I assume we do but it seems likely to miss the train at this point, leaving this bug in limbo.

[Add an input length check to \_strtod - v1](attachment.cgi?id=403404&action=diff) (obsolete)

Thanks, wtc. I was on the right path, but you greatly simplified what I was doing.
JS\_DTOA\_ENOMEM doesn't seem to be actually used anywhere, as far as actually being set. dtoa.c never sets errno = ENOMEM directly, though I guess one of the memory-related functions could do it.
I just made JS\_DTOA\_EINVAL return out-of-memory error like JS\_DTOA\_ENOMEM. If wanted, I can add a new error number/message for it.
I haven't tested this yet... just getting the patch posted before I start a build.

Add an input length check to \_strtod - v1
It concerns me that this length-checking stuff isn't being done inside dtoa, since I think it means you're paying to walk the string twice... what're the perf implications of that? Is this just meant to prevent a DOS?

Add an input length check to \_strtod - v1
Reed: I like your change to JS\_strtod.
We should do the string length check in JS\_strtod instead
of \_strtod because I believe dtoa.c should be kept as close
to the upstream version as possible.
We can report a long input string as JSMSG\_NEED\_DIET, or
JSMSG\_CANT\_CONVERT, or JSMSG\_CANT\_CONVERT\_TO.

The length-check in my patch is the exact same one that NSPR is using, so I'm not sure what you mean. wtc did post a new patch in [bug 516396](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") to do the length-check inline, but it's not complete or ready yet.

What's not ready about wtc's inline length-check? Also, hasn't the actual security-sensitive part of this landed? The length-check only prevents a hang/DoS, unless I am misunderstanding.
If I'm right, we shouldn't rush in a patch that -must- have performance implications when we have something potentially far better (even if it means waiting a short while for the "far better" bit).

Yeah, I thought about that, but the comment describing NO\_ERRNO clearly says:
\* #define NO\_ERRNO if strtod should not assign errno = ERANGE when
\* the result overflows to +-Infinity or underflows to 0.
... and this is for EINVAL, not ERANGE. I guess I can just update the comment unless somebody thinks that define is specific to ERANGE for some reason.

I based the whitespacing in my patch on prevailing style of another switch in jsdtoa.cpp: <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/jsdtoa.cpp#191>

Huh? It's (rv = freelist[k]), so rv is set to freelist[k] during the |if|.

Isn't short boolean evaluation by default in C++?

Anyway, freelist[] is a static array of [Kmax+1] elements so it should not be accessed when k > Kmax+1, right?

This is C, not C++ (both nsprpub/pr/src/misc/prdtoa.c and js/src/dtoa.c).

Sure, which is why the check is for |k <= Kmax| before freelist[] is accessed.

Ah, but js/src/jsdtoa.cpp is C++, and it |#include|s dtoa.c, so yes, it is compiled using C++. Sorry about that.

Yes, but I'm still talking about uninitialized rv when (k > Kmax).

Oh! I was looking at the NSPR code and the upstream dtoa.c, not the js code. My apologies. This is what I get for reading bugmail at 5am.
This problem is because we do the check slightly differently between NSPR and js code:
NSPR:
if (k <= Kmax && (rv = freelist[k]))
freelist[k] = rv->next;
else {
js:
if (k <= Kmax && (rv = freelist[k]) != NULL)
freelist[k] = rv->next;
if (rv == NULL) {
Martin correctly points out that rv could never be set because we'll short-circuit on |k <= Kmax| if that returns false. Simple fix would be just to swap to how NSPR does it, I think. Does that seem reasonable?

No, my last comment is still wrong. Basically, the patch we use for 1.9.1 and greater is fine. It's the 1.9.0 patch ([attachment 401451](/attachment.cgi?id=401451 "patch - v1 (1.9.0)") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=401451&action=edit "patch - v1 (1.9.0)") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=401451&action=diff "patch - v1 (1.9.0)") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516862&attachment=401451)) that is wrong. \*sigh\*

Thanks, Martin, for noticing this. My apologies again for looking at the wrong patch when trying to check what you were seeing.
Anyway, this changes the code to look more like what NSPR and js >= 1.9.1 is using, which I believe should fix this issue.
I did say "untested patch" in [comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=516862#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in js/src/dtoa.c's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)")! :)

It's OK that it was untested at that point. It's not really OK that it was review-stamped without testing, or that it was approved based on a rubber stamp of an untested patch, though!

I just sent it off to the try server. Once a build pops out, I'll test it against the testcases.

I've run the testcase in [bug 516396](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)"), which doesn't crash on 1.9.0.15 (and does on 1.9.0.14) but takes five minutes to run.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-59

## Heap buffer overflow in string to number conversion

Announced
October 27, 2009
Reporter
Alin Rad Pop
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.15
* Firefox 3.5.4

### Description

Security researcher **Alin Rad Pop** of Secunia
Research reported a heap-based buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to
floating point number conversion routines. Using this vulnerability
an attacker could craft some malicious JavaScript code containing a
very long string to be converted to a floating point number which
would result in improper memory allocation and the execution of an
arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus be leveraged
by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.

**Update:** The underlying flaw in the `dtoa` routines used
by Mozilla appears to be essentially the same as that reported against the
libc `gdtoa` routine by **Maksymilian Arciemowicz**.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be installed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Critical: php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0311)

## Topic

Updated php packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way PHP parsed floating point
numbers from their text representation. If a PHP application converted
untrusted input strings to numbers, an attacker able to provide such input
could cause the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the application. (CVE-2009-0689)

It was found that PHP did not properly handle file names with a NULL
character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to make a PHP
script access unexpected files and bypass intended file system access
restrictions. (CVE-2006-7243)

All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1057555#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-01-24 10:50:10 UTC  ``` PHP uses a strtod() implementation using code written by David M. Gay.  This code was previously identified to contain a flaw leading to a heap based buffer overflow when overly long string representing a floating point number is parsed to a number.  The problem was assigned CVE ids [CVE-2009-0689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0689) ([bug 539784](show_bug.cgi?id=539784 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-0689 array index error in dtoa implementation of many products")) and [CVE-2013-4164](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4164) ([bug 1033460](show_bug.cgi?id=1033460 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4164 ruby: heap overflow in floating point parsing")) and was fixed in various other projects re-using this affected code.  The problem was already corrected in PHP before the security issue was identified and [CVE-2009-0689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0689) assigned, via the following upstream commit:  <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=37da90248deb2188e8ee50e4753ad6340679b425>  The fix was included in PHP 5.2.2.  This wasn't identified as security fix, or mentioned in the changelog for that PHP release:  <http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.2.2>  Problem can be triggered remotely if PHP application handles value from a request as numeric / floating point.  This issue affects php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  The php53 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are based on fixed upstream version and are therefore unaffected.  The php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and older do not contain vulnerable code.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1057555#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-18 18:57:20 UTC  ``` Making the bug public.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1057555#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-18 19:43:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 EUS - Server Only   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 Long Life   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life  Via RHSA-2014:0312 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0312.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1057555#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-18 19:45:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0311 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0311.html>   ``` |  |

The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=662707#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-13 16:45:35 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that PHP would accept filenames with a NULL character in the string, and silently truncate anything after the NULL character.  This could lead to unexpected results and could possibly disclose the existence of certain system files.  This was initially reported against the file_exists() function, but a number of other functions were changed to prevent PHP from considering paths with a NULL character as being valid [2].  This has been corrected in the upstream 5.3.4 release [3].

Honour the floating-point rounding mode in floating-point formatting.

C99, Sec. 7.19.6.1 `The fprintf function', paragraph 13, p. 281:
   (Recommended practice)
   For e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, if the number of significant
   decimal digits is at most DECIMAL_DIG, then the result should be
   correctly rounded.  If the number of significant decimal digits is
   more than DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is exactly
   representable with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result should be
   an exact representation with trailing zeros.  Otherwise, the
   source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings L < U,
   both having DECIMAL_DIG significant idgits; the value of the
   resultant decimal string D should satisfy L <= D <= U, _with the
   extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for
   the current rounding direction_.  [emphasis added]

The gdtoa code base already supports respecting the floating-point
rounding mode, as long as we compile it with Honor_FLT_ROUNDS
defined.  However, for this to work, fegetround must be available in
libc, which it is not currently -- the fenv logic is in libm.

Fortunately, we don't have to move all of fenv from libm to libc --
programs that do not link against libm don't have fesetround, so the
rounding mode is always the default (barring asm shenanigans that
bypass the API -- tough).  So use a weak reference to fegetround; by
default, assume FE_TONEAREST if it is not defined.

Mark the libc fegetround weak reference unused.
Not all .c files that include gdtoaimp.h use it, which makes clang
unhappy.

```

Honour the floating-point rounding mode in floating-point formatting.

C99, Sec. 7.19.6.1 `The fprintf function', paragraph 13, p. 281:

   (Recommended practice)

   For e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, if the number of significant
   decimal digits is at most DECIMAL_DIG, then the result should be
   correctly rounded.  If the number of significant decimal digits is
   more than DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is exactly
   representable with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result should be
   an exact representation with trailing zeros.  Otherwise, the
   source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings L < U,
   both having DECIMAL_DIG significant idgits; the value of the
   resultant decimal string D should satisfy L <= D <= U, _with the
   extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for
   the current rounding direction_.  [emphasis added]

The gdtoa code base already supports respecting the floating-point
rounding mode, as long as we compile it with Honor_FLT_ROUNDS
defined.  However, for this to work, fegetround must be available in
libc, which it is not currently -- the fenv logic is in libm.

Fortunately, we don't have to move all of fenv from libm to libc --
programs that do not link against libm don't have fesetround, so the
rounding mode is always the default (barring asm shenanigans that
bypass the API -- tough).  So use a weak reference to fegetround; by
default, assume FE_TONEAREST if it is not defined.

defined(_NETBSD_SOURCE) is equivalent to (!defined(_ANSI_SOURCE) &&

need to check both of them.
Fix for issue reported in PR [lib/35401](http://gnats.NetBSD.org/35401) as well as related overflow bugs.
deal with hex doubles.
Instead of abusing stdio to get a signal-safe version of sprintf, provide one.
remove __SAFE
add long double and hex double support from freebsd.
make this compile.
add new prototypes.
add the new files to the build. Note I am not bumping libc now, because
these are not used yet.
Merge the int bit with the high fraction bit. Add constants/macros
needed by gdtoa.
add constants used by gdtoa
since the int bit is merged, do the explicit math.
ext_int bit is no more.
ext_int bit is no more.
- merge change from freebsd
- add support for building as vfprintf.c
- XXX: we strdup to simplify the freeing logic. This should be fixed for
  efficiency in the vfprintf case.
use vfwprintf.c
enable wide doubles.
some int -> size_t
deal with sparc64 that has 112 bits of mantissa.
make extended precision gdtoa friendly.
int/size_t changes
make this gdtoa friendly.
remove dup definition
use dtoa() instead of returning empty when we don't have extended precision
information.
Fix previous, add forgotten pointer dereference in the call to dtoa().
Add a cheesy workaround marked XXX for the situation where the
strtod() implementation available in the environment does not
handle hex floats.
Discussed with and suggested by christos
From Christos:  gdtoa fixes for m68k.  M68k ports should build now, but
printing extended precision is a little off.
vax does not have <machine/ieee.h> or long double
It would be nice if the compiler provided something like __IEEE_MATH__
bring in FreeBSD's vfscanf() to gain multi-byte/collation support.
Unfortunately it is too difficult to make vfwscanf and this share
the same code like I did with printf, because for string parsing
the code is too different.

From Secunia to security@:
---------------------------
Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.
The vulnerability is caused due to an array indexing error while
allocating space for floating point numbers. This can be exploited to
trigger a memory corruption via a specially crafted floating point
number.
Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
The vulnerability is confirmed in version 3.0.14 and 3.5.3. Other
versions may also be affected.
Vulnerability Details:
----------------------
The vulnerability is caused due to an error when converting strings to
floating point numbers in nsprpub/pr/src/misc/prdtoa.c.
The s2b() function takes the total number of digits and determines the
first number K for which : 1 << K >= (numdigits + 8)/9.
K is then passed to Balloc() to allocate memory. Balloc() dereferences
the static "freelist" buffer of 16 elements using K as an index. If K is
above 15, malformed pointers following the freelist array will be
returned from Balloc().
\*\*\*
#define Kmax 15
...
static Bigint \*freelist[Kmax+1];
...
Balloc ..(k)..
...
if (rv = freelist[k]) { <-- out of bounds
freelist[k] = rv->next;
}
...
return rv;
\*\*\*
For e.g. K = 17, a pointer to a limited heap buffer is returned from
Balloc(), and used to hold the converted big number. This results in a
heap-based buffer overflow, followed by a call to a function grabbed
from a corrupted pointer to a virtual function table. This results in
the execution of an arbitrary address when paired with heap spraying.
Closing comments:
-----------------
We have assigned this vulnerability Secunia advisory SA36711 and CVE
identifier [CVE-2009-1563](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1563).

Thank you for this bug report.
dtoa.c is also used in Mozilla's, WebKit's, and Chromium's
JavaScript implementations, and in Ruby. Has Secunia or
CVE notified the other users of dtoa.c? We should also
notify dtoa.c's author, David M. Gay.
The obvious fix of comparing the index 'k' with Kmax in
Balloc is incomplete because we need a corresponding
change to Bfree:

It seems that we'll have to either require that k <= Kmax,
or to reallocate freelist when it's not big enough.

After chatting with Chris Evans of the Google Security Team,
I found that this bug is already fixed in the dtoa.c upstream:
<http://www.netlib.org/fp/dtoa.c>
Since dtoa.c's author only publishes the latest revision of
dtoa.c, it's not easy to extract the fix for this bug, but
I believe the fix is entirely within the Balloc and Bfree
functions. See also this OpenBSD patch for gdtoa, which is
the next generation of dtoa.c:
<http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/gdtoa/misc.c.diff?r1=1.1;r2=1.2;f=h>
The code looks very similar to dtoa.c.

[Patch from dtoa.c upstream](attachment.cgi?id=400623&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=400623&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=400623)

Note that the value of Kmax is also reduced from 15 to 7.
I don't know why.
I believe this entry in the "changes" file
(<http://www.netlib.org/fp/changes>) describes this
change:
Sun Mar 1 20:57:22 MST 2009
dtoa.c and gdtoa/gdtoaimp.h and gdtoa/misc.c: reduce Kmax, and use
MALLOC and FREE or free for huge blocks, which are possible only in
pathological cases, such as dtoa calls in mode 3 with thousands of
digits requested, or strtod() calls with thousand of digits. For the
latter case, I have an alternate approach that runs much faster
and uses less memory, but finding time to get it ready for distribution
may take a while.

Patch from dtoa.c upstream
er, I clicked submit too early...
I'm not an NSPR peer, so tossing to ted for review. My initial look through the checks seems ok, though, and it's pretty similar to what gdtoa did to fix this problem.
However, I did have a random question... this new code adds the use of free(), which was not used directly before in prdtoa. Do we need to do anything special because of it (such as use PR\_Free() instead or something like that)?

Patch from dtoa.c upstream
The best person to review this patch is a JS developer
familiar with jsdtoa.cpp. Any volunteer? Is Brian
Crowder still working on Mozilla?
Reed, thanks for the review. We don't need to do
anything special about the new FREE macro. If FREE
is not defined, the code uses free(), which matches
malloc(). (The code defines MALLOC as malloc by
default. It should also define FREE as free by
default.)

It's explained in the "changes" file entry (see [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)")).
We don't want to add huge blocks to 'freelist'. It's
possible that dtoa.c's author fixed this bug unknowingly
when he reduced Kmax to 7.

We'll need to get NSPR tag(s) with the fix created for the various branches (trunk/1.9.2, 1.9.1, 1.9.0). Can you assist with that?

Patch from dtoa.c upstream
Approved for 1.9.1.4, a=dveditz
I guess for the branches using hg (trunk,1.9.2,1.9.1) you just check those in there, but for 1.9.0.x we'll need an updated NSPR tag and corresponding client.mk change.

The hg branches should also use a tag: unless things have gone very strange we update hg to NSPR/NSS tags using client.py.

I will work on a new NSPR release this weekend and next Monday.
Does any of the 1.9.0.15-based Mozilla products need to support
Windows 9x or Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3?

This does crash 1.9.1.3 cleanly on Linux. When I run this testcase on last night's 1.9.1.4pre build (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4pre) Gecko/20090921 Shiretoko/3.5.4pre), Firefox just hangs completely instead of crashing. Status1.9.1 says that this is fixed so this is either not fixed after all or the status was changed before the NSPR made it into the build so it isn't fixed yet.
Can someone comment?

The status of this bug has not been fixed on any Firefox build. The fix has been checked into the NSPR trunk ([comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c15 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)")).

oops, I was off by one field. Thanks.
This is showing up in my "unverified for 1.9.1.4" query from the Tinderbox though for some reason.
It's strange that if it isn't fixed, it isn't crashing in the same way as 1.9.1.3 though.

I pushed the fix as part of the NSPR\_4\_8\_1\_BETA1 CVS tag
to mozilla-1.9.1 in changeset ae5cf3fd2e69:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/ae5cf3fd2e69>
I will push the NSPR\_4\_8\_1\_RTM tag to mozilla-1.9.1 after
two days of testing. Please let me know before you do your
first 1.9.1.4 candidate build.
Firefox 3 is using NSPR\_4\_7\_5\_RTM, so the upgrade to NSPR
4.8.1 will be a minor version upgrade. But I'm confident
it'll be uneventful.

Thunderbird 2 probably can get away without it (and certainly isn't going to be happy with an upgrade to nspr 4.8.1) but SeaMonkey 1.1.x definitely needs it.
I think the testcases in this bug are testing [bug 516862](/show_bug.cgi?id=516862 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in js/src/dtoa.c's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") -- the behavior on 1.9.0.15pre definitely changed even though this fix hasn't landed on the 1.9.0 branch yet (but that one has). I think we'd need an SVG testcase to trigger the NSPR version of this function. I'm not sure the fix is correct, though, since it still crashes (differently): see [bug 516862 comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=516862#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in js/src/dtoa.c's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)")Flags: wanted1.8.1.x+Flags: blocking1.8.1.next+

Does SeaMonkey 1.1.x need to support Windows 9x or Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3?
I am considering adding an input length check to PR\_strtod to prevent it
from running for too long. The NSPR test case in this patch takes a long
time to finish, so I can't check it in.

[Add an input length check to PR\_strtod](attachment.cgi?id=402499&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=402499)

It's very difficult to check the string length as we parse
it, so I just added a string length check at the beginning
of the PR\_strtod function.
If the string is too long, PR\_strtod returns 0.0 and sets
the PR\_INVALID\_ARGUMENT\_ERROR. This is modeled after the
strtod function, which returns 0.0 and sets errno to EINVAL
when it cannot convert the string:

We currently have already broken Win9x support due to the NSS upgrade, but that might even be fixed. SeaMonkey 1.1.x has supported all those versions so far and it would be quite bad to break it within the series. We want to avoid that if in any way possible.

Uh, wait, as I understand it, SM 1.1.x has the same platform support as FF2,
which is the set of platform supported for the 1.8 branch. As I understand
it, that set is shown on
<http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/system-requirements-v2.html>
It does not include Win95 or NT 3.5, but it does include Win98 and NT 4.0.

No, 1.8.1 branch itself and therefore also SeaMonkey 1.1.x actually do support Win95 (with DCOM for Win95) and NT 3.51, Firefox/Toolkit did desupport those there without the actual platform losing support for them, so we continued to include those system, see <http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey1.1.18/installation#win_requirements> - and a number of users were happy about it.
There was no large outcry now that this NSS upgrade broke those systems where IE4 isn't installed, but we did get a number of people reporting it.
Of course, the SeaMonkey 2.0 coming next month on a 1.9.1 base desupports everything below Win2k, but it's a huge jump in every respect after all. It would be nice if we could support the old systems for a few months still (even though I don't dare to talk about the number of security patches we are already missing on 1.8.1 branch compared to 1.9.0 or 1.9.1 so far.

and the strnlen library code might be more well optimized on some
platforms than the compiler's code for that for loop. Since this entire
exercise is about bounding time spent, seems like we should optimize
where we can.

Which is better to return in this case? 0.0? or NAN?
r+=nelson, because I believe the patch is correct as is, but if you
think any of these suggestions is an improvement, and want to make it,
please feel free to make another.

Add an input length check to PR\_strtod v2
Nelson, thanks for the review comments.
I considered strnlen but am not sure if it's
available on all the platforms. Maybe we can
add a configure test for it.
The 0.0 return value and PR\_INVALID\_ARGUMENT\_ERROR
are modeled after strtod().
I checked in this patch on the NSPR trunk (NSPR 4.8.1).

As for [comment 50](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c50 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)"), prdtoa is a huge performance bottleneck. We simply stopped using it in the CSS parser (since we don't in fact need most of the things it does for us)... I don't know whether that's reasonable in the SVG case; if not the only way I see to fix the performance issue is to do the length check during conversion.

To be more precise, in the css parser we used to both call dtoa and ToInteger; we switched to producing both results at once; with some loss of precision on the dtoa that's not noticeable in practice due to how css stores its floats.

Thank you for the report of performance regression in SVG.
The performance degradation is expected. I made a judgment
call to favor developer productivity (including time
required for another developer to review the length check)
over best possible performance. If you can devote more
time than I can and can line up a competent code reviewer,
please do the length check during conversion.
The need for the length check is clear if you click Reed's
JavaScript test case in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") and watch the browser
consume 100% CPU for a long time. It shouldn't be hard to
construct a SVG test case.

This makes sense to me and I agree that it's probably not worth worrying about. I've opened a [bug 519794](/show_bug.cgi?id=519794 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add a comment about using PR_strtod") about adding a comment to the svg code about the performance of PR\_strtod. If the problem becomes important we can deal with it then.

Attached patch

[Do the length check during conversion](attachment.cgi?id=403970&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=403970&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=403970)

It's not as hard as I thought, if I dive into the code.
You can consider using this patch for JavaScript.
This patch does the length check after PR\_strtod has
counted the number of digits. Since the various counters
nd, nd0, nf, nz, nz0 have the type 'int', in 64-bit
environment these counters can overflow if the input
string is longer than 2G characters. I didn't bother
to fix this integer overflow issue in this patch.
The fix is probably to declare these counters as
size\_t and eliminate any compiler warnings by
typecasts.

Why? This bug/symptom is fixed, reopening implies they aren't. We're taking additional patches to fix regressions but that's what the regression bug is for.

I haven't followed this entire bug in great detail before now.
Was the input length check that was added in [attachment 402883](/attachment.cgi?id=402883 "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=402883&action=edit "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=402883&action=diff "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=402883) necessary to
eliminate the vulnerability? Or was it merely a performance enhancement,
bounding the time spent in this function on absurdly long strings?
I'm not sure exactly what the objectives of the patch in [attachment 403970](/attachment.cgi?id=403970 "Do the length check during conversion") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=403970&action=edit "Do the length check during conversion") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=403970&action=diff "Do the length check during conversion") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=403970)
are, so it is difficult for me to judge if it accomplishes those or not.
So, instead of giving r+ or r-, I will make some review observations and let
Wan-Teh or others determine if these should be considered r- or not.
The patch in [attachment 402883](/attachment.cgi?id=402883 "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=402883&action=edit "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=402883&action=diff "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=402883) absolutely limited the input string length
to an upper bound of a certain size in all cases. The patch in attachment
403970 [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=403970) does not. Leading zero characters, before the decimal point (if any)
are not counted against that limit. That's probably OK.
Likewise, the number of zero characters immediately following the decimal
point are not counted against that total, unless they are followed by a
non-zero digit. That's probably OK too.
I think I could construct some strings that would be detected by the
patch in [attachment 402883](/attachment.cgi?id=402883 "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=402883&action=edit "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=402883&action=diff "Add an input length check to PR_strtod v2") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=402883), but not by the patch in [attachment 403970](/attachment.cgi?id=403970 "Do the length check during conversion") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=403970&action=edit "Do the length check during conversion") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=403970&action=diff "Do the length check during conversion") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=403970), and
would waste oceans of CPU time, and maybe produce incorrect results. Would
the existence of such a string mean that this patch is not accomplishing its
objective?
Consider an input string consisting of a '1' following by hundreds of
thousands, or millions of digits, followed by a decimal point. Or alternatively, a decimal point, followed by hundreds of thousands, or
millions of zero digits, followed by a non-zero decimal digit.
Eventually, the huge number of digits would be detected, but not before
hundreds of thousands, or millions, of integer multiplies (by 10) had been
done, wasting LOTS of CPU time. Seems like, at the very least, the code
should detect overflow of the accumulators in those multiply-by-10-and-add
loops, but it doesn't. But that's probably a separate pre-existing bug.

[Do the length check during conversion v2](attachment.cgi?id=404642&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=404642&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=404642)

This patch is equivalent to the previous patch but is more
readable. 'nd' won't change after the dig\_done label, so it's
better to check 'nd' as soon as we reach that stage.
dveditz: Can we just fix the vulnerability for now? The input
length check requires a lot of time from two developers (one
to write the patch, the other to review it). I can't spend
too much time on this bug.
Nelson, the input length check is not necessary to eliminate the
vulnerability. It merely bounds the time spent in PR\_strtod on
absurdly long strings. However, without the input length check,
it's hard for QA to verify the vulnerability fix because the
application consumes 100% CPU for a very long time (at least two
minutes) on Reed's test case for JavaScript.
The original input length check is incorrect because it applies
to the entire input string, but we should only check the initial
part of the input string that is a number. For example, an
absurdly long string of the form
"0.0not a number not a number not a number ..."
should be accepted by PR\_strtod because only the "0.0" part of
the string needs to be converted. The original input length
check causes this valid input to fail.
During the initial parsing phase, up to the dig\_done label,
PR\_strtod never multiplies by 10 for more than roughly
DBL\_DIG + 1 times.

BTW, FWIW, after reviewing the portion of the code that Wan-Teh patched,
I'm not sure that the function PR\_strtod will produce the correct result
for a number with more than about 20 digits, e.g. a number like 10^22
when represented without an E+ notation, e.g. 10000000000000000000000.
which is too big to be represented in a 64-bit integer.
I believe that PR\_strtod \_should\_ be able to produce the same answer for that
value as for 1E+22, an answer that is correct to the limits of the precision
of a double, but I suspect it doesn't. I should write a little test program.
But this is a separate issue.

We agree. How do we get to a state where the crash/security-bug is fixed, but we have to live with a hang on stupidly-long strings? I think that means we need to back-out the checkins in [comment 45](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c45 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") and [comment 47](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c47 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)"), and create a new 4.7.6 BETA tag that Firefox 3.0 can use.

Nelson, PR\_strtod always protects multiplications of 'y' and 'z' by 10
with nd < xxx checks:

to 1e22.

As spoken on IRC with dveditz the hang is expected for now due to the regression ([bug 519839](/show_bug.cgi?id=519839 "VERIFIED FIXED - SVG fails to render correctly")) started with the fix for the hang. So with the following builds no crash happens anymore. Marking verified fixed on 1.9.1, 1.9.2, and trunk.

Al, Henrik: We don't have an SVG test case that makes Firefox
crash in prdtoa.c. Reed's test case exercises JavaScript's copy
of dtoa.c.
Reed's test case has an input string of 1024 \* 1024 characters.
A shorter test case of 384 \* 1024 characters should still crash
JavaScript, and will take only 2 minutes to complete with the
crash fix. It'll allow QA to verify the crash fix.

Can we make sure to get those tests checked-in once this bug gets opened to the public? Sadly we don't have a in-testsuite flag for NSPR.

Maksymilian Arciemowicz just informed security@m.o that this bug seems to be similar to -- if not the same as -- [CVE-2009-0689](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0689) (<http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/63>). He reported the issue in June to NetBSD, FreeBSD, and to Google Chrome (as per <http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2009/09/stable-channel-update_30.html>).
A slightly different fix was used in at least NetBSD's gdtoa implementation:
<http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/gdtoa/gdtoaimp.h.diff?r1=1.6&r2=1.7>
Are we sure this bug is completely (and correctly) fixed?

wtc said the 1.8.1 branch can be updated to NSPR 4.7.6, that it both contains the fix and corrects the bustage on older Mac platforms that kept us from using 4.7.5 on that branch. It'll be important to test on the oldest supported versions of Win and Mac to verify we didn't break things. The fix itself doesn't need much more than simple verification as 4.7.6 is the version we're currently using on the 1.9.0 branchKeywords: [fixed1.8.1.24](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed1.8.1.24&resolution=---)

See [bug 509262 comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=509262#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - NSPR configure still defines minimum Mac OS X version as 10.2 on PPC") for the changes I made in NSPR 4.7.6
to restore support for Mac OS X 10.2 and 10.3. Please focus
your testing on two things on Mac OS X:
1. No build errors.
2. Test a feature that uses the PR\_GetPhysicalMemorySize function.
Alternatively, attach a debugger and verify PR\_GetPhysicalMemorySize
returns the right value.
You don't need to do extra testing on Windows.

MoCo QA has a single OS X 10.3 machine available to test on. We don't have 10.2.
As far as testing a feature that uses the PR\_GetPhysicalMemorySize function, can someone suggest one for Thunderbird or Seamonkey 1.1?

After doing a few rounds with IT, QA has no way to test on OS X 10.2. We have a 10.3 machine to test on but no access to 10.2 media to even install it.

to install Mac OS X 10.2.

This broke, at the very least, OS X 10.5 and 10.6. Thunderbird 2 will just hang, before even getting to profile manager, when invoked.
Here is a sample from the latest nightly with the problem: <http://ss.pastebin.mozilla.org/704905>
Last good build is Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.24pre) Gecko/2010022203 Thunderbird/2.0.0.24pre
The only checkin is this bug.

I'm going to find out if 10.4 is broken. We've been waiting on an IT fix happening right now to check 10.2 and 10.3 but that should be resolved anytime.

The 10.2 and 10.3 tests were on a PPC box. I checked 10.4 on PPC (the highest we have there) and it works there as well. It looks like Intel is what is busted.
I am told that for PPC, we build with the 10.2.8 SDK and for Intel I think we use the 10.4u SDK.

That's right
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.8/source/build/macosx/universal/mozconfig#49>
That file is sourced at the top of the mozconfig for the build.

Dunno if this is related, but when we landed NSPR 4.7.3 on the 1.9.0 branch (cvs head) we had to back it out because it caused [bug 466531](/show_bug.cgi?id=466531 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash/hang [@ mult][@ Balloc] when loading pages on PPC") (crashes on PPC). Relanding 4.7.3 involved patching mozilla/js/src/jscpucfg.cpp, and the 1.8.1 branch does not have those fixes.
Since PPC is working fine now maybe that's completely unrelated.

Wan-Teh, I think you want to ask Nick this. I'm QA so I don't work with the Mac build machine and I don't have 1.8.1 setup to build on any box that I own.

The box is

so we're building natively on PPC, then cross-compile for Intel, then create a Universal build from those.
Dan, could you look at the suggested attachment ?

Attached patch

[jscpucfg fix from bug 466531 for the 1.8 branch](attachment.cgi?id=429065&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=429065&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=516396&attachment=429065)

The patch applied cleanly, shifted a bit (minus the client.mk part, of course). I've attached a merged version here because I can't check into mozilla/js/src -- it's locked down.

The bustage for Thunderbird from previous checkins is now fixed and TB is verified to run on OS X 10.5 and 10.6 intel and on 10.4 and 10.3 PPC.
Re-reading all of the old comments, including my own, I realize that the case in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=516396#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Array indexing error in NSPR's Balloc() leads to floating point memory vulnerability (SA36711)") is for the JS version of this, not the SVG version, per Wan-Teh. I've already verified that SVG is fixed in [bug 519839](/show_bug.cgi?id=519839 "VERIFIED FIXED - SVG fails to render correctly"). The JS version was [bug 521306](/show_bug.cgi?id=521306 "RESOLVED FIXED - DoS in prdtoa after bug 516396 is fixed"). Do we need to fix this for 1.8.1.24?

The js fix is [bug 516882](/show_bug.cgi?id=516882 "RESOLVED FIXED - Lightning needs UI/CSS tweaks for SeaMonkey."), and we've taken that in 1.8.1.24; [bug 521306](/show_bug.cgi?id=521306 "RESOLVED FIXED - DoS in prdtoa after bug 516396 is fixed") is about the fact that now that we've prevented the crash we realize the routine can get really really slow on huge numbers. We're not going to hold 1.8.1.24 for that DoS fix.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-11-21 02:50:07 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that KDE's kdelibs 4.3.3, and possibly earlier versions, suffers from a flaw in its dtoa implementation.  A heap-based buffer overflow in the string to floating point number conversion routines could allow an attacker to craft some malicious JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating point number.  This could result in improper memory allocation and the execution of an arbitrary memory location, which could be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.  This same flaw was originally reported against OpenBSD and NetBSD [2], and is similar to the Mozilla flaw [CVE-2009-1563](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1563).  A patch to correct this issue was commited to kdelibs/kjs/dtoa.cpp today [3].  [1] <http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=125867830114502&w=2> [2] <http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/63> [3] <http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-commits&m=125874573511598&w=2>     <http://websvn.kde.org/?view=revision&revision=1052100>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-24 23:23:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1601 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1601.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c9)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-20 18:22:44 UTC  ``` An updated MITRE description for this is:  Array index error in the (1) dtoa implementation in dtoa.c (aka pdtoa.c) and the (2) gdtoa (aka new dtoa) implementation in gdtoa/misc.c in libc, as used in multiple operating systems and products including in FreeBSD 6.4 and 7.2, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 4.5, Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x before 3.0.15 and 3.5.x before 3.5.4, K-Meleon 1.5.3, SeaMonkey 1.1.8, and other products, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large precision value in the format argument to a printf function, which triggers incorrect memory allocation and a heap-based buffer overflow during conversion to a floating-point number.    Note that [CVE-2009-1563](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1563) was made a duplicate of this CVE, however we have noted that [CVE-2009-1563](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1563) was fixed in some Firefox errata.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c10)  Vincent Danen    2010-12-20 18:25:35 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 530162](show_bug.cgi?id=530162 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2009-1563 firefox: (rejected CVE-2009-1563) Firefox heap buffer overflow in string to number conversion") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-18 15:11:48 UTC  ``` Affected dtoa implementation is or was used in multiple projects.  [Comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c0) above mentions OpenBSD and NetBSD, along with KDE Konqueror browser JavaScript engine kjs, and Mozilla products (Firefox, Seamonkey and Thunderbird).  Mozilla products shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux were fixed via the following errata:  firefox <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1530.html>  seamonkey <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1531.html>  thunderbird <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0153.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0154.html>  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c9) mentions that [CVE-2009-1563](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1563) was originally used in Mozilla errata, but the CVE id was later rejected as duplicate of this [CVE-2009-0689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0689).  More recently, the issue was fixed in ruby using a different CVE id [CVE-2013-4164](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4164) ([bug 1033460](show_bug.cgi?id=1033460 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-4164 ruby: heap overflow in floating point parsing")) for the same issue.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-18 19:43:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 EUS - Server Only   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 Long Life   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life  Via RHSA-2014:0312 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0312.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-18 19:45:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0311 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0311.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-18 20:46:34 UTC  ``` This issue also affected PHP and was fixed upstream in version 5.2.2 before this was fixed in kdelibs or Mozilla products.  For further details, see [bug 1057555](show_bug.cgi?id=1057555 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-0689 php: heap overflow in floating point parsing").  Errata listed in [comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c12) and [comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c13) are for php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 that were affected by the issue.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=539784#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-18 20:48:46 UTC  ``` There are other projects that use this dtoa implementation and already include a fix for this issue (python, mysql, mariadb, nspr), or used it in the past (v8).   ``` |  |
