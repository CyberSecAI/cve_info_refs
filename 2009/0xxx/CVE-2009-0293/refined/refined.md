Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `profile_view.php` file of the Wazzum Dating Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `userid` parameter in the `profile_view.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials or other private information. They could also potentially modify or delete data or even gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a malicious HTTP GET request to `profile_view.php` with a crafted `userid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, which means they could be located anywhere with network access to the server. No authentication or special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is the `userid` parameter in the URL, as seen in the exploit example:
`http://localhost/[path]/profile_view.php?userid=-1 union select 1,2,3,4,5,@@version /*`
- The exploit uses the `-1 union select` technique which is a standard method for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities by adding a UNION SELECT statement to retrieve data and the @@version to confirm the vulnerability and database version.

The Exploit-DB entry provides more detail than the CVE description by showing exactly how to inject SQL code into the `userid` parameter.
