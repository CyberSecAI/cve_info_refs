# Welcome to Red Hat Bugzilla

Thank you for visiting Red Hat Bugzilla. Red Hat Bugzilla is the Red Hat bug-tracking
system and is used to submit and review defects that have been found in Red
Hat distributions. Red Hat Bugzilla is not an avenue for
technical assistance or support, but simply a bug tracking system. If you submit a
defect, please provide detailed information in your submission after you
have queried Red Hat Bugzilla to ensure the defect has not been reported yet.
Defects will go directly to the engineer responsible for the component you
filed the defect against. Engineers have many responsibilities and will get to
your defect in due time.

If you are a Red Hat customer with an active subscription, please
visit the  [Red Hat Customer Portal](http://access.redhat.com)
for assistance with your issue.

If you are a Fedora Project user and require assistance, please consider using one
of the [mailing lists](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Communicate) we host for the Fedora Project.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0458)

## Topic

An updated gpdf package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

GPdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in GPdf's JBIG2 decoder. An
attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause GPdf to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0147,
CVE-2009-1179)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in GPdf's JBIG2 decoder. An
attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause GPdf to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0146,
CVE-2009-1182)

Multiple flaws were found in GPdf's JBIG2 decoder that could lead to the
freeing of arbitrary memory. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file
that would cause GPdf to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when
opened. (CVE-2009-0166, CVE-2009-1180)

Multiple input validation flaws were found in GPdf's JBIG2 decoder. An
attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause GPdf to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0800)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in GPdf's JBIG2 decoder. An
attacker could create a malicious PDF that would cause GPdf to crash when
opened. (CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1183)

Red Hat would like to thank Braden Thomas and Drew Yao of the Apple Product
Security team, and Will Dormann of the CERT/CC for responsibly reporting
these flaws.

Users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains
backported patches to correct these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=490614#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-03-17 10:30:59 UTC  ``` Multiple integer overflows and one integer signedness error were found in the JBIG2 decoder. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of service (application crash) via specially-crafted PDF file.
