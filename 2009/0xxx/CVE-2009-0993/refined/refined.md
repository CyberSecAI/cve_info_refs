Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0993:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a format string flaw within the Oracle Process Manager and Notification (opmn) daemon. This daemon is an HTTP server that listens on a TCP port above 6000.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The opmn daemon fails to properly sanitize or handle format string tokens present in the POST URI when logging to the `$ORACLE_HOME/opmn/logs/opmn.log` file. This occurs because the input from the URI is directly used in a logging function without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP POST request that includes format string tokens in the URI that will be logged.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable port on the server where the opmn daemon is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted server.
*   **Understanding of Format String Exploitation:** The attacker needs a certain level of technical expertise to craft the malicious HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) advisory identifies the vulnerability as **ZDI-09-017 / ZDI-CAN-248**.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a specific Digital Vaccine filter (ID 5729).
*   Oracle issued a patch to correct the vulnerability, detailed in the April 2009 Critical Patch Update.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on 2007-11-07 and the coordinated public release of the advisory took place on 2009-04-14
* The vulnerability was discovered by Joxean Koret.

In summary, CVE-2009-0993 is a critical vulnerability due to the potential for remote, unauthenticated arbitrary code execution through a format string vulnerability within the Oracle opmn daemon.
