Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-0776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `nsIRDFService` handles cross-domain redirects when fetching XML data. Specifically, the `RDFXMLDataSource` fails to properly enforce the same-origin policy when encountering redirects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-domain data theft:** The primary vulnerability is that a malicious website can use a specially crafted URL with the `RDFXMLDataSource` and force a cross-domain redirect, allowing it to obtain XML data from a different domain than the original request. This is a violation of the same-origin policy.
- **Lack of same-origin checks:** The `RDFXMLDataSource` does not correctly check the origin of the redirected URL.
- **XML data exposure:**  The vulnerability allows the retrieval of arbitrary XML data, including potentially sensitive information from webmail or other web applications

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data theft:** An attacker can potentially steal private or sensitive XML data from users who are authenticated on a different domain.
- **Information disclosure:** This could include user credentials, personal information, or other sensitive data present in the targeted XML data
- **Potential for further attacks:** If the stolen XML data contains API keys or other access tokens, it could enable further attacks on the compromised accounts or services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-domain redirect:** The attack relies on using a malicious website that initiates a request using the `RDFXMLDataSource`, and then using an HTTP redirect to point to a different, victim domain.
- **nsIRDFService exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered through the improper handling of redirects by the `nsIRDFService`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to be able to entice a user into loading their crafted web page in a vulnerable browser.
- The user needs to have access to some form of XML based resource on the target domain.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to how the  `nsXULTemplateBuilder.cpp` uses the `RDFXMLDataSource`
- The fix involves implementing proper same-origin checks, specifically by leveraging `nsSameOriginChecker` which provides methods for observing the channel and checking for cross-origin redirects. This is similar to how XMLHttpRequest checks are implemented.

This vulnerability affected multiple products including: Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird. The identified fix was to implement the same origin check within the `RDFXMLDataSource`.
