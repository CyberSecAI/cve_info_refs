Subject: CVE-2009-0778 kernel: rt_cache leak

Reported by Hector Herrera:
A "REJECT" route in a software router (ip_forward = 1) based on CentOS
5.2 will cause the kernel to lose track of cached routes.  Once the
number of allocated route cache objects (as indicated by the value of
ip_dst_cache in /proc/slabinfo) reaches the value of
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size - 1, the kernel will complain with a
'dst cache overflow' errors for every received packet and all network
connectivity will cease.

But was introduced in upstream commit 8b7817f3a95. It was later fixed in
upstream commit 7c0ecc4c4f.

Workaround:
- either remove or replace the "REJECT" route with a different
alternative such as 'ip route add 10.10.0.0/16 via 127.0.0.1'.
- using iptables.

Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
attacker has access to the Service Console network.

Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
[http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726](/resources/techresources/726) for more
information on VMware security best practices.

The currently installed version of JRE depends on your patch
deployment history.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c0)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-12 00:31:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 331637](attachment.cgi?id=331637 "ip_dst_cache (in blue) VS `route -Cn | wc -l` (in green) over time") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=331637&action=edit "ip_dst_cache (in blue) VS `route -Cn | wc -l` (in green) over time") ip_dst_cache (in blue) VS `route -Cn | wc -l` (in green) over time  Description of problem: The value of ip_dst_cache (in /proc/slabinfo) continues to grow constantly, even thought the cached route table remains fairly constant.  This leads to the eventual time when ip_dst_cache reaches the value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size.  When this happens, the kernel complains with 'dst cache overflow' and the server no longer responds to any network activity.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel 2.6.18-92.1.22.el5   How reproducible: live system being currently affected by this issue.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure test machine as a router between two networks 2. send packets from network A to network B with a large number of different source/dest IPs 3. Watch the values of ip_dst_cache and rt_cache    Actual results: ip_dst_cache continues to grow while rt_cache grows and shrinks with the traffic  Expected results: ip_dst_cache and rt_cache follow each other closely.  Values return to zero after traffic stops and route cache entries expire.

Btw, have you tested the upstream kernel?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c10)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-21 19:02:40 UTC  ``` I changed it to a security bug because once I figured out how the bug reacted to network traffic and I was able to come up with a simple remote DoS attack, which in my mind exposed vulnerable servers to a high risk.  My initial intent was to report a bug that was present on some of the servers I manage.  I haven't tested the issue with any mainline kernels.  I tried looking for a howto/guide on how to compile mainline into RHEL or CentOS but I didn't find anything too useful.  If you can give me pointers I can try it on my virtual machines.  I realize that there are probably very few servers which are vulnerable, thus making this a minor issue.  But those servers would most likely be part of network infrastructure (routers for ISPs for example) and the effects of a attack on one of those would affect a larger user base.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c13)  Neil Horman    2009-02-24 18:08:47 UTC  ``` I'm starting to have second thoughts about the seriousness of this, as I look over the code and the analysis thereof.  In looking at this, you're adding a route of type RTN_UNREACHABLE to the fib, and then sending a ton of packets through the system, and observing that the number of dst cache entires on the slab is growing unboundedly while the actual number of dst entries in the route cache is remaining constant at or near its max value.  I agree on the surface that looks like a leak, but the path from creating a dst entry in ip_route_input_slow, at the local_input label for routes of type RTN_UNREACHABLE, to where they are hashed into place in rt_intern_hash is very short and consice, and I don't see any way we can leak a dst entry out of there.  That said, I started to think about the data above, and its missing a bit.  Depending on which field you looked at in /proc/slabinfo, that data could be perfectly valid.  if dst entires are freed back to their slab cache, the active number will go down for that cache, but the total number will stay until such time as the kernel shrinks the cache, which may not happen if there is sufficient memory in the system.  Some questions) 1) If you stop traffic on the system, and wait for a gc_cycle on the router, does it become possible to pass traffic again?  2) If the answer to one is yes, can this problem be avoided by      a) increasing /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size     b) lowering /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_elasticity     c) lowering /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_interval     d) raising /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_thresh  That should instruct the garbage collector for the route cache to be much more agressive in its collection   Bear in mind, that I'm not suggesting that this isn't a bug, I'm just trying to get straight about weather this is a true leak, or if perhaps its simply a condition set in which the garbage collector isn't as agressive as it needs to be.  Its fairly clear in ip_route_input_slow, that when we go to allocate a dst, if dst_alloc fails (which it will if the route cache entries are greater than gc_thresh), we will not route the frame, so I think we likely just need to make sure that if dst_alloc is going to fail, we get much more agressive in our garbage collection.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c14)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-24 19:49:30 UTC  ``` The value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_interval is 60  I performed the following test:  (all times are in minutes  00: Sent packet storm at time 01: Ceased all network traffic 14: observed the count of active routes drop to zero 14: value of ip_dst_cache is 32767 14: confirmed server is still offline by sending 1 ping 19: rt_cache count is 2 (probably from ping at time 14) 19: value of ip_dst_cache is 32768 19: confirmed server is still offline by sending 1 ping 28: value of rt_cache is 0 28: value of ip_dst_cache is 32768 28: confirmed server is still offline by sending 1 ping  I'll also attach a graph of our live router values showing the history for the last few days.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c15)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-24 19:52:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 333083](attachment.cgi?id=333083 "rt_cache values over an extended time period") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=333083&action=edit "rt_cache values over an extended time period") rt_cache values over an extended time period  The blips on Mon, Tue and Wed are reboots.  The blue line tracks the value of ip_dst_cache, the green area tracks the value of `ip -o route ls cache | wc -l`.  When I learned that the issue was caused by the "REJECT" route, I removed the route on Thursday.  Since then the value of ip_dst_cache has remained constant.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c16)  Neil Horman    2009-02-24 20:24:39 UTC  ``` What value are you looking at when you say that ip_dst_cache is 32767?  Is it the first column or the second?  I would not be suprised if the second column stays high, in fact it should until there is a good deal of memory pressure on the system and the cache needs to shrink.  If thats the first column on the other hand, then yes, that seems to be an issue, especially if the route cache entries goes to 2.  That would suggest that you do in fact have a leak somewhere.  What would be really helpful would be if you could catch a sumbmit a vmcore, so that I could look through the route cache by hand.  Also, when you sent those pings through the system, did you continue to get the dst cache overflow messages?  That would be of great interest.  If you didn't then you hit on an existing route in the table, and the frame should have been processed further, which in turn suggests this might not be a routing problem.  It would be good, if after you preformed the above test, you captured /proc/net/snmp.  That would give us a better idea of where you were dropping frames.  In summary: 1) details about how you are tracking ip_dst_cache size, so that we can confirm that active objects are or are not being reclaimed. 2) a vmcore if possible, so that I can look through the kernel memory image by hand, and get some idea of where these errant dst entries are living. 3) capture of /proc/net/snmp after the test in [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c14) is preformed, so that we can get a better idea of where these frames are getting dropped.  Also, how are you generating your various input frames.  Are you using a hw solution like an ixia or smartbits box, or are you doing it in software?  Just trying to get an idea of the volume and variation of traffic that I need to start working on a reproducer here.  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c17)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-24 20:57:48 UTC  ``` If you look at the report I sent to oCERT (it's attached to this bug), you will find details on the setup I'm using to test as well as my test scripts.  The packet generator is the pktgen kernel module configured to send randomized src IPs to random destination IPs inside the "REJECT"'d route.  I'm looking at the first value of ip_dst_cache.  When I ping the server and it doesn't respond, I do see a 'dst cache overflow' message, precisely one console message for each packet received, no matter the source or destination IP.  I'll perform the test again and obtain a vmcore and dump of /proc/net/snmp and post it here once it's done.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c18)  Neil Horman    2009-02-24 21:27:27 UTC  ``` Ok, thanks, it'll take me a few days to get the systems together to set up a reproducer, but I think thats going to be the best way to figure out exactly whats going on here.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c20)  Neil Horman    2009-02-25 18:58:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 333204](attachment.cgi?id=333204 "stap script to help diagnose potential router leak") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=333204&action=edit "stap script to help diagnose potential router leak") stap script to help diagnose potential router leak  hey there, while I'm getting the systems together to recreate this, would you mind running this systemtap script on your router there, and providing me with the output?

I'm using RHEL 5.3, with the -128.el5 kernel, and your script from your oCert submission.  I'm repeatedly sending 100000 packets over and over again (about every 10 seconds), and when I check the active objects in the ip_dst_cache against the number of cached routes, they always track fairly closely against both each other, and the number of packets I'm sending (as I would expect).  Then when I discontinue packet sends to the unreachable route, and let the router quiesce, both the slab cache and the route cache quickly shrink again, also as I would expect.  So it would seem that there is some more subtle nuance in your system that is triggering your system to have this issue.  Can you send me a sysreport of your system?  I'd like to compare your tunables to mine to see if anything is off between our setups.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c24)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-27 23:51:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 333557](attachment.cgi?id=333557 "sosreport with kernel 2.6.18-128.el5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=333557&action=edit "sosreport with kernel 2.6.18-128.el5") sosreport with kernel 2.6.18-128.el5  I got a hold of kernel-2.6.18-128.el5 and I can still reproduce the bug with it.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c25)  Neil Horman    2009-03-01 00:10:07 UTC  ``` Thank you, was this taken on the system after the problem had occured, or prior to it?

I've now managed to reproduce the problem, and I can only do it if I add a default route to the route cache (as per the oCert docs).  Previously I had forgotten to add a default route, and everything worked like a charm.  slabcache and route cache grew and shrank as you would expect.  But as soon as we added a default route, the cache filled up and overflowed.  The route cache shrinks again, and it appears the slabcache is shrinking as well, although I need to monitor it to see if it returns to its expected size in correlation with the route cache.  Its interesting to note that even after the route cache is back to a steady state size for my invironment (between 2 and 10 routes), I don't see dst cache overflow messages, but I do see Neighbour table overflow messages, indiating something has gone wrong with the arp table as well (perhaps the overuse of src macs with multiple IP sources via pktgen, I'm not sure).  I'm getting the feeling like we're not looking up the reject route properly, when we have a default gw route (its like the def. gw is at a higher priority or something).  I'll try a few tests and update again this afternoon.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c30)  Neil Horman    2009-03-02 15:48:46 UTC  ``` Note to self: Just tried to reproduce with 2.6.18-8.el5 and was unable to, so this problem was introduced sometime during one of the RHEL update cycles.

Hector, you can download them here: <http://people.redhat.com/eteo/485163/>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c34)  Hector Herrera    2009-03-03 08:26:59 UTC  ``` Thank you, I was still getting my build environment setup when I saw the posting by Eugene.  I downloaded the kernel-2.6.18-131.el5.[bz485163](show_bug.cgi?id=485163 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-0778 kernel: rt_cache leak leads to lack of network connectivity").rpm (and kernel-devel too) and installed both.  Rebooted to the new kernel then I proceeded to followed my usual testing process.  at time 0, I flooded the server until I received dst cache overflow messages.  After a few seconds the values of rt_cache and ip_dst_cache settled at 32767.  after 5 minutes, both rt_cache and ip_dst_cache dropped to 32766  after another 8 minutes, rt_cache dropped to zero and ip_dst_cache remained at 32766.  A ping test at this time showed that the server is unreachable from the network.  Each ping packet caused one dst cache overflow message.  Would you like sosreports for this kernel test?   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c35)  Neil Horman    2009-03-03 11:31:37 UTC  ``` No, thank you, its not going to show me anything.  I can't understand why my cache is leaking so much less than yours.  By the way, when I reproduce this, I occasionally get Neighbour table overflow indications rather than dst cache overflow notifications (which odd as it may seem, are both attributable to route cache overflows).  Do you see those, or are yours strictly dst cache overflow messages?   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c36)  Hector Herrera    2009-03-03 18:09:34 UTC  ``` I only see 'dst cache overflow' messages.  I checked /var/log/messages but I found nothing else.   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c37)  Neil Horman    2009-03-04 18:16:29 UTC  ``` ok, making slow progress here  I'm able to observe the leak with a single packet.  If I send in a single packet using the pktflood script from the ocert document, and then flush the cache via /proc/net/ipv4/route/flush, the route cache is cleaned but a single slab cache entry remains active.  I've instrumented the kernel and found that on flush, both the route cache entries that are added (one from the host to the unreaachable network via l0 and another from the local router interface to the sending system) are removed.  That tells me we're dealing with an out of whack ref count when entering rt_intern_hash.  Thats good progress.  I'll report more soon.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c38)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-05 14:14:14 UTC  ``` Update: Neil is able to reproduce the leak, in single packet quantities using the setup described in the oCERT doc. It requires exactly what the setup says, an unreachable route and a default route.  It is definitely a remote DoS attack, as anyone with the described configuration can have their router ability to forward traffic terminated. It is possible to work around this issue until it is fixed, including the loopback route mentioned in the ticket, as well as an iptables solution.   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c39)  Andrea Barisani    2009-03-06 09:11:14 UTC  ``` Hi everybody,  am I correct to assume that with a recent kernel this issue is not present? I'm trying to understand if it deserves some kernel maintainer ping as well (they would likely ignore it if affects 2.6.18 only which is quite old).  Other than that while the full impact discussion might not be public the bug itself is. Considering that there is a workaround I think this bug deserves to be opened (and if we feel necessary a preliminary advisory could be released as there is a workaround). Hoping of course that a patch would be available asap.  Thoughts?   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c41)  Neil Horman    2009-03-06 19:22:49 UTC  ``` Almost certain I've found the problem.  Its fixed in upstream commit 7c0ecc4c4f8fd90988aab8a95297b9c0038b6160.  The problem is that we fail to dst_release the result of a route lookup when sending the icmp host unreachable response to the frames that is attempted to be directed along the unreachable route.  I'm building a test kernel for it now that we can all use to verify it.   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c42)  Neil Horman    2009-03-07 01:05:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334377](attachment.cgi?id=334377&action=diff "patch to fix the dst_entry leak") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334377&action=edit "patch to fix the dst_entry leak") patch to fix the dst_entry leak  I've confirmed it, the backport patch I'm attaching here solves the leak.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c0)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-12 00:31:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 331637](attachment.cgi?id=331637 "ip_dst_cache (in blue) VS `route -Cn | wc -l` (in green) over time") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=331637&action=edit "ip_dst_cache (in blue) VS `route -Cn | wc -l` (in green) over time") ip_dst_cache (in blue) VS `route -Cn | wc -l` (in green) over time  Description of problem: The value of ip_dst_cache (in /proc/slabinfo) continues to grow constantly, even thought the cached route table remains fairly constant.  This leads to the eventual time when ip_dst_cache reaches the value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size.  When this happens, the kernel complains with 'dst cache overflow' and the server no longer responds to any network activity.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel 2.6.18-92.1.22.el5   How reproducible: live system being currently affected by this issue.   Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure test machine as a router between two networks 2. send packets from network A to network B with a large number of different source/dest IPs 3. Watch the values of ip_dst_cache and rt_cache    Actual results: ip_dst_cache continues to grow while rt_cache grows and shrinks with the traffic  Expected results: ip_dst_cache and rt_cache follow each other closely.  Values return to zero after traffic stops and route cache entries expire.

The reason I asked is because this bug was first created as a public bug, and it was made private many days later. So, I am not sure why this bug should be kept private if it is already made public previously.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c8)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-02-21 08:40:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c7)) > (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c6)) > > Created an attachment (id=332786) [details] [details] > > Report sent to oCERT with regards to this issue > >  > > Public disclosure to follow oCERT disclosure guidelines and only upon agreement > > with oCERT and reporter >  > Thanks Hector.

Btw, have you tested the upstream kernel?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c10)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-21 19:02:40 UTC  ``` I changed it to a security bug because once I figured out how the bug reacted to network traffic and I was able to come up with a simple remote DoS attack, which in my mind exposed vulnerable servers to a high risk.  My initial intent was to report a bug that was present on some of the servers I manage.  I haven't tested the issue with any mainline kernels.  I tried looking for a howto/guide on how to compile mainline into RHEL or CentOS but I didn't find anything too useful.  If you can give me pointers I can try it on my virtual machines.  I realize that there are probably very few servers which are vulnerable, thus making this a minor issue.  But those servers would most likely be part of network infrastructure (routers for ISPs for example) and the effects of a attack on one of those would affect a larger user base.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c13)  Neil Horman    2009-02-24 18:08:47 UTC  ``` I'm starting to have second thoughts about the seriousness of this, as I look over the code and the analysis thereof.  In looking at this, you're adding a route of type RTN_UNREACHABLE to the fib, and then sending a ton of packets through the system, and observing that the number of dst cache entires on the slab is growing unboundedly while the actual number of dst entries in the route cache is remaining constant at or near its max value.  I agree on the surface that looks like a leak, but the path from creating a dst entry in ip_route_input_slow, at the local_input label for routes of type RTN_UNREACHABLE, to where they are hashed into place in rt_intern_hash is very short and consice, and I don't see any way we can leak a dst entry out of there.  That said, I started to think about the data above, and its missing a bit.  Depending on which field you looked at in /proc/slabinfo, that data could be perfectly valid.  if dst entires are freed back to their slab cache, the active number will go down for that cache, but the total number will stay until such time as the kernel shrinks the cache, which may not happen if there is sufficient memory in the system.  Some questions) 1) If you stop traffic on the system, and wait for a gc_cycle on the router, does it become possible to pass traffic again?  2) If the answer to one is yes, can this problem be avoided by      a) increasing /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size     b) lowering /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_elasticity     c) lowering /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_interval     d) raising /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_thresh  That should instruct the garbage collector for the route cache to be much more agressive in its collection   Bear in mind, that I'm not suggesting that this isn't a bug, I'm just trying to get straight about weather this is a true leak, or if perhaps its simply a condition set in which the garbage collector isn't as agressive as it needs to be.  Its fairly clear in ip_route_input_slow, that when we go to allocate a dst, if dst_alloc fails (which it will if the route cache entries are greater than gc_thresh), we will not route the frame, so I think we likely just need to make sure that if dst_alloc is going to fail, we get much more agressive in our garbage collection.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c14)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-24 19:49:30 UTC  ``` The value of /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/gc_interval is 60  I performed the following test:  (all times are in minutes  00: Sent packet storm at time 01: Ceased all network traffic 14: observed the count of active routes drop to zero 14: value of ip_dst_cache is 32767 14: confirmed server is still offline by sending 1 ping 19: rt_cache count is 2 (probably from ping at time 14) 19: value of ip_dst_cache is 32768 19: confirmed server is still offline by sending 1 ping 28: value of rt_cache is 0 28: value of ip_dst_cache is 32768 28: confirmed server is still offline by sending 1 ping  I'll also attach a graph of our live router values showing the history for the last few days.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c15)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-24 19:52:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 333083](attachment.cgi?id=333083 "rt_cache values over an extended time period") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=333083&action=edit "rt_cache values over an extended time period") rt_cache values over an extended time period  The blips on Mon, Tue and Wed are reboots.

Is it the first column or the second?  I would not be suprised if the second column stays high, in fact it should until there is a good deal of memory pressure on the system and the cache needs to shrink.  If thats the first column on the other hand, then yes, that seems to be an issue, especially if the route cache entries goes to 2.  That would suggest that you do in fact have a leak somewhere.  What would be really helpful would be if you could catch a sumbmit a vmcore, so that I could look through the route cache by hand.  Also, when you sent those pings through the system, did you continue to get the dst cache overflow messages?  That would be of great interest.  If you didn't then you hit on an existing route in the table, and the frame should have been processed further, which in turn suggests this might not be a routing problem.  It would be good, if after you preformed the above test, you captured /proc/net/snmp.  That would give us a better idea of where you were dropping frames.  In summary: 1) details about how you are tracking ip_dst_cache size, so that we can confirm that active objects are or are not being reclaimed. 2) a vmcore if possible, so that I can look through the kernel memory image by hand, and get some idea of where these errant dst entries are living. 3) capture of /proc/net/snmp after the test in [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c14) is preformed, so that we can get a better idea of where these frames are getting dropped.  Also, how are you generating your various input frames.  Are you using a hw solution like an ixia or smartbits box, or are you doing it in software?  Just trying to get an idea of the volume and variation of traffic that I need to start working on a reproducer here.

The packet generator is the pktgen kernel module configured to send randomized src IPs to random destination IPs inside the "REJECT"'d route.  I'm looking at the first value of ip_dst_cache.  When I ping the server and it doesn't respond, I do see a 'dst cache overflow' message, precisely one console message for each packet received, no matter the source or destination IP.  I'll perform the test again and obtain a vmcore and dump of /proc/net/snmp and post it here once it's done.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c18)  Neil Horman    2009-02-24 21:27:27 UTC  ``` Ok, thanks, it'll take me a few days to get the systems together to set up a reproducer, but I think thats going to be the best way to figure out exactly whats going on here.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c20)  Neil Horman    2009-02-25 18:58:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 333204](attachment.cgi?id=333204 "stap script to help diagnose potential router leak") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=333204&action=edit "stap script to help diagnose potential router leak") stap script to help diagnose potential router leak  hey there, while I'm getting the systems together to recreate this, would you mind running this systemtap script on your router there, and providing me with the output?

I'm using RHEL 5.3, with the -128.el5 kernel, and your script from your oCert submission.  I'm repeatedly sending 100000 packets over and over again (about every 10 seconds), and when I check the active objects in the ip_dst_cache against the number of cached routes, they always track fairly closely against both each other, and the number of packets I'm sending (as I would expect).  Then when I discontinue packet sends to the unreachable route, and let the router quiesce, both the slab cache and the route cache quickly shrink again, also as I would expect.  So it would seem that there is some more subtle nuance in your system that is triggering your system to have this issue.  Can you send me a sysreport of your system?  I'd like to compare your tunables to mine to see if anything is off between our setups.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c24)  Hector Herrera    2009-02-27 23:51:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 333557](attachment.cgi?id=333557 "sosreport with kernel 2.6.18-128.el5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=333557&action=edit "sosreport with kernel 2.6.18-128.el5") sosreport with kernel 2.6.18-128.el5  I got a hold of kernel-2.6.18-128.el5 and I can still reproduce the bug with it.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c25)  Neil Horman    2009-03-01 00:10:07 UTC  ``` Thank you, was this taken on the system after the problem had occured, or prior to it?

I've now managed to reproduce the problem, and I can only do it if I add a default route to the route cache (as per the oCert docs).  Previously I had forgotten to add a default route, and everything worked like a charm.  slabcache and route cache grew and shrank as you would expect.  But as soon as we added a default route, the cache filled up and overflowed.  The route cache shrinks again, and it appears the slabcache is shrinking as well, although I need to monitor it to see if it returns to its expected size in correlation with the route cache.  Its interesting to note that even after the route cache is back to a steady state size for my invironment (between 2 and 10 routes), I don't see dst cache overflow messages, but I do see Neighbour table overflow messages, indiating something has gone wrong with the arp table as well (perhaps the overuse of src macs with multiple IP sources via pktgen, I'm not sure).  I'm getting the feeling like we're not looking up the reject route properly, when we have a default gw route (its like the def. gw is at a higher priority or something).  I'll try a few tests and update again this afternoon.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c30)  Neil Horman    2009-03-02 15:48:46 UTC  ``` Note to self: Just tried to reproduce with 2.6.18-8.el5 and was unable to, so this problem was introduced sometime during one of the RHEL update cycles.

I can't understand why my cache is leaking so much less than yours.  By the way, when I reproduce this, I occasionally get Neighbour table overflow indications rather than dst cache overflow notifications (which odd as it may seem, are both attributable to route cache overflows).  Do you see those, or are yours strictly dst cache overflow messages?   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c36)  Hector Herrera    2009-03-03 18:09:34 UTC  ``` I only see 'dst cache overflow' messages.

If I send in a single packet using the pktflood script from the ocert document, and then flush the cache via /proc/net/ipv4/route/flush, the route cache is cleaned but a single slab cache entry remains active.  I've instrumented the kernel and found that on flush, both the route cache entries that are added (one from the host to the unreaachable network via l0 and another from the local router interface to the sending system) are removed.  That tells me we're dealing with an out of whack ref count when entering rt_intern_hash.  Thats good progress.  I'll report more soon.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c38)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-05 14:14:14 UTC  ``` Update: Neil is able to reproduce the leak, in single packet quantities using the setup described in the oCERT doc. It requires exactly what the setup says, an unreachable route and a default route.  It is definitely a remote DoS attack, as anyone with the described configuration can have their router ability to forward traffic terminated. It is possible to work around this issue until it is fixed, including the loopback route mentioned in the ticket, as well as an iptables solution.   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=485163#c39)  Andrea Barisani    2009-03-06 09:11:14 UTC  ``` Hi everybody,  am I correct to assume that with a recent kernel this issue is not present? I'm trying to understand if it deserves some kernel maintainer ping as well (they would likely ignore it if affects 2.6.18 only which is quite old).  Other than that while the full impact discussion might not be public the bug itself is. Considering that there is a workaround I think this bug deserves to be opened (and if we feel necessary a preliminary advisory could be released as there is a workaround).
