# MLdonkey 2.9.7 - Arbitrary File Disclosure

#### EDB-ID:

###### 8097

#### CVE:

###### [2009-0753](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-0753)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Michael Peselnik](/?author=1595)

#### Type:

###### [remote](/?type=remote)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Multiple](/?platform=multiple)

#### Date:

###### 2009-02-23

**Vulnerable App:**

```
MLdonkey (up to 2.9.7) has  a  vulnerability  that allows remote user to access any
file   with   rights   of  running  Mldonkey  daemon  by  supplying  a
special-crafted  request  (ok,  there's  not much special about double
slash) to an Mldonkey http GUI (tcp/4080 usually).

Reference:
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25667

Thus, the exploit would be as simple as accessing any file on a remote
host with your browser and double slash:

http://mlhost:4080//etc/passwd

# milw0rm.com [2009-02-23]

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Subject: CVE request: mldonkey arbitrary file download vulnerability

mldonkey in version 2.9.7 and earlier permits remote attackers to
download arbitrary files accessible to the mldonkey daemon, using
crafted requests to the HTTP console.

<<https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?25667>>

(The proposed patch deals with this in a rather odd place.)

# MLDonkey: Information disclosure — GLSA **200903-36**

A vulnerability in the MLDonkey web interface allows remote attackers to
disclose arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-p2p/mldonkey** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.0** |

### Background

MLDonkey is a multi-network P2P application written in Ocaml, coming
with its own Gtk GUI, web and telnet interface.

### Description

Michael Peselnik reported that src/utils/lib/url.ml in the web
interface of MLDonkey does not handle file names with leading double
slashes properly.

### Impact

A remote attacker could gain access to arbitrary files readable by the
user running the application.

### Workaround

Disable the web interface or restrict access to it.

### Resolution

All MLDonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/mldonkey-3.0.0"
```

Package        : mldonkey
Vulnerability  : path traversal
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-0753
Debian Bug     : 516829

It has been discovered that mldonkey, a client for several P2P
networks, allows attackers to download arbitrary files using crafted
requests to the HTTP console.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.5-2+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this problem.

We recommend that you upgrade your mldonkey packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny

| [Tue 24 Feb 2009 06:30:32 PM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3)   For the record, this bug was caused by *[patch #5787](/patch/?5787)*, committed  2007/03/08 to CVS and first released in MLDonkey 2.8.4.   That bad patch can be found around line 1493 in  <http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/mldonkey/mldonkey/src/daemon/driver/driverControlers.ml?r1=1.96&r2=1.97> | [spiralvoice <spiralvoice>](/users/spiralvoice) Group administrator |

| [Mon 23 Feb 2009 08:29:47 AM UTC, comment #1:](#comment1)   I was expecting, that reaction would be fast. Don't you guys believe that this is a strong security issue? | [kyak <kyak>](/users/kyak) |
| [Sun 22 Feb 2009 08:55:40 AM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0)   THIS ITEM WAS REASSIGNED TO *[PATCH #6754](/patch/?6754)* I can access <http://myip:4080//etc/passwd> from my browser.   Actually, i can access any file, readable by mldonkey, i just need to put a double slash before the name.   It looks like a thttpd double slash request arbitrary file access  vulnerability CVE-1999-1456.   I am astonished that this has been staying undetected and unfixed for such a long time. | [kyak <kyak>](/users/kyak) |
