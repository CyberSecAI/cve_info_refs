```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `default_language` parameter in the `login.php` script. This parameter is directly used in a `require_once` statement, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application includes files based on user-provided input without proper validation, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary local files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive data, such as configuration files, source code, or even system files. This can lead to further attacks such as privilege escalation or complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by manipulating the `default_language` GET parameter in the `login.php` script, injecting a path to a local file to be included. The `login.php` script is directly accessible and doesn't require prior authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and does not require any prior authentication or specific positioning within the network."
