  "response": {
    "relevance": "RELEVANT",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider improperly isolating processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts.",
      "weaknesses": "Two separate processes running under the same account have full access to each otherâ€™s resources such as file handles, registry keys, and other handles. The WMI provider host process holds SYSTEM Tokens in certain scenarios.",
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the LocalSystem account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker must first gain access to a computer under the context of a NetworkService or LocalService account. The attacker can then execute code to probe the WMI provider host processes for SYSTEM tokens. Once a SYSTEM token is found, the attacker's code can use it to gain SYSTEM level privileges.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine with NetworkService or LocalService privileges. They must also have knowledge of how to probe the WMI provider host processes for SYSTEM tokens."
