Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0528:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection. This means that the attacker cannot directly see the results of their SQL queries. Instead, the exploit uses timing-based techniques to infer the data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that the `frame.php` script within IF-CMS is susceptible to blind SQL injection through the `id` parameter. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator usernames and passwords, by using time-based blind SQL injection techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `frame.php` script, manipulating the `id` parameter to inject SQL commands.
*   **Timing-based Attack:** Due to blind nature of injection, the exploit relies on the execution time of the database query, which depends on success of the injected condition. If the condition is true, it will slow down server response (due to the `BENCHMARK()` function), indicating that the tested character in the password is correct.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable IF-CMS application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:**  The attacker needs to know that the `id` parameter of `frame.php` is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.
*   **Basic Scripting Knowledge:** The provided exploit code indicates that some level of scripting knowledge (in PHP, in this case) is necessary to automate the process of extracting data using timing attacks.
