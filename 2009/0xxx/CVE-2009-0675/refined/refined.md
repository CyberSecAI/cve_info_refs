  "cveId": "CVE-2009-0675",
  "datePublished": "2009-02-20",
  "vulnerability": {
    "summary": "The skfp_ioctl function in drivers/net/skfp/skfddi.c in the Linux kernel permits SKFP_CLR_STATS requests only when the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability is absent, instead of when this capability is present, which allows local users to reset the driver statistics, related to an \"inverted logic\" issue.",
    "description": "The `skfp_ioctl` function in `drivers/net/skfp/skfddi.c` in the Linux kernel has an inverted logic flaw. It allows non-privileged users to clear driver statistics instead of restricting this action to users with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability. ",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "drivers/net/skfp/skfddi.c in Linux kernel"
    ],
    "rootCause": "Inverted logic in the permission check within the skfp_ioctl function.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect permission check",
        "Inverted Logic",
        "Improper Capability check"
     ],
    "impact": {
      "availability": "Local users can reset network driver statistics, potentially interfering with monitoring or accounting systems.",
       "confidentiality": "No direct impact to confidentiality is mentioned, but manipulating statistics might obscure network activity.",
       "integrity": "Manipulation of statistics could lead to false or inaccurate monitoring data."
    },
    "attackVector": "Local access.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker requires local access to the system but does not require root privileges.",
