Subject: CVE request for proftpd

An SQL injection vulnerability in proftpd was reported on bugtraq
yesterday that could allow a user to login to proftpd with any password
if they use mysql for authentication (and, presumably, postgresql).

References:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=485125>

Could we get a CVE name assigned please?

Thanks.

# ProFTPd - 'mod\_mysql' Authentication Bypass

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Just found out a problem with proftpd's sql authentication. The problem is easily reproducible if you login with username like:

USER %') and 1=2 union select 1,1,uid,gid,homedir,shell from users; --

and a password of "1" (without quotes).

which leads to a successful login. Different account logins can be made successful using the limit clase (e.g appending "LIMIT 5,1" will make you login with as the 5th account in the users table).

As far as I can see in the mysql logs the query becomes:

SELECT userid, passwd, uid, gid, homedir, shell FROM users WHERE (userid='{UNKNOWN TAG}') and 1=2 union select 1,1,uid,gid,homedir,shell from users limit 1,1; -- ') LIMIT 1

I think the problem lies in the handling of the "%" character (probably that's some way to sanitize input to avoid format string things?).

Anyway, %' effectively makes the single quote unescaped and that eventually allows for an SQL injection during login.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

That's correct.

Yes; I was just about to note the same thing. =)

Yeah, I noted that above.  =)

Thanks, TJ.  I just read the comments and the duplicate note a few
minutes ago and was going to reply to it.

We still need a CVE name, however.  Bug #3124 does not note any kind of
security impact, which there clearly is, so I don't believe a CVE name
had been assigned to this previously (at least not that I could find).

# ProFTPD: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-27**

Two vulnerabilities in ProFTPD might allow for SQL injection attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-ftp/proftpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.2** |

### Background

ProFTPD is an advanced and very configurable FTP server.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were reported:

* Percent characters in the username are not properly handled, which
  introduces a single quote character during variable substitution by
  mod\_sql (CVE-2009-0542).
* Some invalid, encoded multibyte characters are not properly handled in
  mod\_sql\_mysql and mod\_sql\_postgres when NLS support is enabled
  (CVE-2009-0543).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests to the server,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary SQL statements.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ProFTPD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/proftpd-1.3.2"
```
### References

* [CVE-2009-0542](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0542)
* [CVE-2009-0543](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0543)

**Release date**

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3180#c0)  Shino    2009-02-11 07:13:08 UTC  ``` There was a SQL injection vulnerability reported, references: <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/500823> <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/33722/> <http://milw0rm.com/exploits/8037>  The flaw lies inside the variable substition feature of mod_sql.  For example if a user types in %l as part of the username, mod_sql replaces that with his ip address before it executes the SQL query. A user can exploit this feature to bypass the protection of the sql_escapestring function:  The sql_escapestring correctly replaces ' with \' to prevent SQL injection. But if the user enters %' as part of his username, which gets transformed to %\' by the escape function, mod_sql tries to substitute the variable. As %\ is an unknown variable it get's transformed to {UNKNOWN TAG}' - thus leaving the quote intact and allowing injection of arbritrary sql code.  I think the proper solution is not to perform variable substition on user submitted content at all.  Hopefully someone can fix this problem quickly. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3180#c1)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-11 12:11:43 UTC  ``` Are you able to reproduce this on your server?  If so, what does `proftpd -V' show? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3180#c2)  Shino    2009-02-11 13:16:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2953](attachment.cgi?id=2953 "version information and log output") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2953&action=edit "version information and log output") version information and log output  Proftpd version is 1.3.2rc2. I've attached the full 'proftpd -V'. Additionaly I've included a telnet session and SQL log output of a working injection. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3180#c3)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-11 13:20:59 UTC  ``` I think that this has already been fixed in 1.3.2rc3 and later, as part of [Bug#3124](show_bug.cgi?id=3124 "CLOSED FIXED - mod_sql improperly substitutes variables in user/group names").  This being the case, could you retry your test using the recently released proftpd-1.3.2? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3180#c4)  Shino    2009-02-11 13:58:07 UTC  ``` 1.3.2 indeed fixes the issue. Sorry for the dupe - but it may be important to know that [Bug#3124](show_bug.cgi?id=3124 "CLOSED FIXED - mod_sql improperly substitutes variables in user/group names") also allowed SQL injection. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3180#c5)  TJ Saunders    2009-02-11 14:02:13 UTC  ``` No worries.  Definitely better safe than sorry. =)  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 3124](show_bug.cgi?id=3124 "CLOSED FIXED - mod_sql improperly substitutes variables in user/group names") *** ``` |  |

Package        : proftpd-dfsg
Vulnerability  : SQL injection vulnerabilites
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-0542 CVE-2009-0543

The security update for proftpd-dfsg in DSA-1727-1 caused a regression
with the postgresql backend. This update corrects the flaw. Also it was
discovered that the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by the
security issues. For reference the original advisory follows.

Two SQL injection vulnerabilities have been found in proftpd, a
virtual-hosting FTP daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0542

Shino discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability
via the use of certain characters in the username.

CVE-2009-0543

TJ Saunders discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection
vulnerability due to insufficient escaping mechanisms, when multybite
character encodings are used.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny2.

The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2-1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.
