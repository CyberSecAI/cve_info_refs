Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-0542:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in how ProFTPD's `mod_sql` module handles percent characters (%) within usernames during SQL queries for authentication.
-  `mod_sql` performs variable substitution before executing the SQL query.
- Specifically, when a user includes "%'" (percent followed by a single quote) in their username, the `sql_escapestring` function escapes the single quote to "\'", however, the variable substitution logic in `mod_sql` then attempts to resolve the unknown variable `%\` replacing it with "{UNKNOWN TAG}\'". This results in an unescaped quote being passed to the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the username with a specific sequence of characters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the authentication query.
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `sql_escapestring` function attempts to sanitize input, but the subsequent variable substitution bypasses this protection, effectively rendering the sanitization incomplete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the normal authentication process. They can log in with any password using a specially crafted username, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the FTP server and its resources.
- **Arbitrary SQL execution:** Depending on the database user privileges and the injected SQL code, it might be possible to read sensitive data, modify database records or even execute arbitrary code on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The attack is performed remotely by a user attempting to log in to the FTP server.
- **Username Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious username that includes the specific character sequence (%') and a password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the FTP server.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** While not strictly necessary for a simple authentication bypass, understanding SQL can allow for more sophisticated exploitation.
- **FTP Client:** The attacker will need an FTP client or a similar tool to connect to the vulnerable FTP server.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** ProFTPD versions 1.3.1 to 1.3.2rc2 are affected by this vulnerability.
- **Fixed Versions:** The issue is resolved in ProFTPD 1.3.2rc3 and later.
- This vulnerability is a duplicate of a previous issue reported as bug 3124 in the ProFTPD bug tracker, however, the security impact of that bug was not initially clear.
- The vulnerability affects ProFTPD instances using MySQL or PostgreSQL for authentication.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200903-27 confirms this vulnerability and its fix in version 1.3.2.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-1730-1 also confirms this vulnerability and notes that etch is not affected, while lenny is affected with version < 1.3.1-17lenny2.
