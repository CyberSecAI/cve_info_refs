Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0641:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The FreeBSD telnet daemon (telnetd) failed to properly sanitize environment variables passed by the connecting client.
- Changes in FreeBSD's environment-handling code rendered telnetd's scrubbing mechanism inoperative.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of environment variables. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.
- Allows injection of arbitrary environment variables.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the telnet daemon, typically root.
- This can lead to a complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker connects to the telnet daemon and specifies the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to point to a malicious shared library.
-  The telnet daemon executes `/bin/login` with the environment variables set, which causes the malicious library to be loaded and executed.
- Local exploitation is possible if the attacker can place the malicious library onto the target system, but remote exploitation is possible if an attacker can upload the malicious library through other services like FTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable telnet daemon.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide arbitrary environment variables during the telnet connection process.
- The attacker must have the ability to place a malicious shared library onto the system's filesystem, either via local access or by exploiting another service (like FTP) on the target system or by using local access.

**Additional details:**
- The `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable allows to load a shared library before the execution of a program.
- The vulnerability is present because the telnetd daemon was not properly sanitizing the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable before calling `/bin/login`.
- The exploit requires the telnet daemon to be enabled, which is not the default configuration.
- The exploit-db content includes a basic code example to demonstrate exploitation.
- While remote exploitation might be more complicated, the exploit-db entry describes a scenario to achieve it.
- The provided references include links to the FreeBSD security advisory and a full disclosure post on the matter.
