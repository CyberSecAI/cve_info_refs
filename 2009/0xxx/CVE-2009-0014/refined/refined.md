  "cveId": "CVE-2009-0014",
  "date": "2009-01-08",
  "description": "A default permissions issue exists in Folder Manager. When a user deletes their Downloads folder and Folder Manager recreates it, the folder is created with read permissions for everyone. This update addresses the issue by having Folder Manager limit permissions so that the folder is accessible only to the user. This issue only affects applications using Folder Manager. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "A default permissions issue in Folder Manager.",
    "weaknesses": [

    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access"

    "requiredCapabilities": "A local user can exploit this vulnerability by having their Downloads folder deleted, which would trigger Folder Manager to recreate the folder with incorrect permissions."
