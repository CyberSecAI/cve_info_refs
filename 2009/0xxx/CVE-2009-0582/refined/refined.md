Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2009-0582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the NTLM SASL authentication mechanism within `evolution-data-server`.
- Specifically, the `ntlm_challenge()` function in `camel/camel-sasl-ntlm.c` does not properly validate the length of the domain string received from the server in NTLM type 2 (challenge) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code uses `atoi` to convert the domain length, which is not a string, but a 16-bit little-endian value, which is not safe, this leads to improper processing of the length field and the data it references. 
- **Memory Disclosure/Crash:** A malicious server can specify a length value larger than the actual data present in the packet, leading to the client reading memory beyond the intended buffer. This out-of-bounds read can potentially cause an information disclosure or a denial-of-service (crash).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** By providing an invalid length, a malicious server could force the client to read and possibly expose portions of its memory.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read could also lead to a crash of the client application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the NTLM authentication process between the client (`evolution-data-server`) and a server.
- A malicious or compromised server can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted NTLM type 2 (challenge) packet with an invalid domain length value.
- This is a Man-in-the-Middle attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to control or be positioned as a malicious server that the vulnerable `evolution-data-server` client is connecting to.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept communication and send custom NTLM packets during the authentication process.
- The attacker can be either on the same network or have a man-in-the-middle position to manipulate network traffic.

**Additional Details:**

-  The issue was addressed by patches that validate the domain length before reading data from the challenge packet.
-  Multiple vendors were notified of the vulnerability on March 4th 2009, allowing for patches to be developed in response.
- RedHat provided patches in RHSA-2009:0354, RHSA-2009:0355, and RHSA-2009:0358 and were public as of March 12.
