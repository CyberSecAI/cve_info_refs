  "CVE-2009-0084": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft DirectShow handles supported format files. This vulnerability could allow code execution if a user opened a specially crafted MJPEG file. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed Huffman tables within MJPEG video files during decompression by Microsoft DirectShow. Specifically, the issue arises when parsing a video frame with a malformed Huffman table (malformed DHT Class), leading to a heap corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap corruption due to malformed Huffman table processing",
        "Use-after-free vulnerability: memory is deallocated and then subsequently written to",
        "Insufficient bounds checking on Huffman table data"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application that processes the crafted MJPEG file.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted MJPEG file",
        "Receiving specially crafted streaming content from a website or any application that delivers web content"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted MJPEG video file containing a malformed Huffman table and deliver this file to a user on a vulnerable system. The attacker can achieve this via email, website, or other means."
    },
    "affected_systems": [
      "Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 with DirectX 8.1",
      "Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 with DirectX 9.0",

        "workarounds": [
            "Disable the decoding of MJPEG content in Quartz.dll via a registry modification",
            "Unregister quartz.dll (which disables .AVI and .WAV playback in Windows Media Player)"
         ],
        "mitigations": [
            "Users with fewer privileges are less impacted",
            "Attackers need to convince users to open the malicious MJPEG file"
