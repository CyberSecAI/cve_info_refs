# pam\_krb5: Privilege escalation â€” GLSA **200903-39**

Two vulnerabilities in pam\_krb5 might allow local users to elevate their
privileges or overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-auth/pam\_krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.12** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.12** |

### Background

pam\_krb5 is a a Kerberos v5 PAM module.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities were discovered:

* pam\_krb5
  does not properly initialize the Kerberos libraries for setuid use
  (CVE-2009-0360).
* Derek Chan reported that calls to
  pam\_setcred() are not properly handled when running setuid
  (CVE-2009-0361).

### Impact

A local attacker could set an environment variable to point to a
specially crafted Kerberos configuration file and launch a PAM-based
setuid application to elevate privileges, or change ownership and
overwrite arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All pam\_krb5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-auth/pam_krb5-3.12"
```

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libpam-krb5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-0360 CVE-2009-0361

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the  PAM module
for MIT Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0360

   Russ Allbery discovered that the Kerberos PAM module parsed
   configuration settings from enviromnent variables when run from a
   setuid context. This could lead to local privilege escalation if
   an attacker points a setuid program using PAM authentication to a
   Kerberos setup under her control.

CVE-2009-0361

   Derek Chan discovered that the Kerberos PAM module allows
   reinitialisation of user credentials when run from a setuid
   context, resulting in potential local denial of service by
   overwriting the credential cache file or to privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-1etch1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.11-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-krb5 package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# pam-krb5 2009-02-11 Advisory

| Vulnerability type: | Local privilege escalation, local file overwrite |
| --- | --- |
| Versions affected: | All versions prior to 3.13 |
| Versions fixed: | 3.13 and later |
| Reported: | 2009-01-29 |
| Public announcement: | 2009-02-11 |
| CVE IDs: | CVE-2009-0360, CVE-2009-0361 |

A security vulnerability in pam-krb5 allowing overwrite and chown of
arbitrary files via Solaris su was discovered by Derek Chan and reported
by Steven Luo on 2009-01-29. Subsequent code auditing for behavior in
setuid applications uncovered another, more general and more serious bug
that could result in privilege escalation.

This advisory is only for my pam-krb5 module, as distributed from my web
site and packaged by Debian, Ubuntu, and Gentoo. These vulnerabilities
will likely also affect any PAM modules derived from mine, but I'm not
personally aware of any such modules in widespread use. The Red Hat,
Sourceforge, and Solaris pam\_krb5 and pam\_krb5afs modules have completely
different lineages and code and would need to be checked separately for
the presence or absence of these problems. I urge all Kerberos PAM module
developers to check their modules for similar problems.

The following two vulnerabilities are present in all versions of my
pam-krb5 module prior to 3.13:

CVE-2009-0360

When linked with MIT Kerberos, pam-krb5 did not use the correct API
for initializing the Kerberos libraries in a setuid context. This
meant the MIT Kerberos libraries would trust environmental variables
to locate the Kerberos configuration. An attacker could exploit this
to bypass authentication checks in setuid applications using PAM for
authentication, resulting in privilege escalation. This vulnerability
was not present if pam-krb5 was linked with the Heimdal Kerberos
implementation.

CVE-2009-0361

pam\_setcred with PAM\_REINITIALIZE\_CREDS or PAM\_REFRESH\_CREDS is used
to refresh existing credentials for a user, such as when releasing a
locked screen. It therefore honors the existing KRB5CCNAME
environment variable to locate the existing Kerberos credential cache.
This means, however, that if those APIs were called by a setuid
application without first calling PAM\_ESTABLISH\_CREDS or dropping
privileges, pam-krb5 may overwrite and chown the file specified by
KRB5CCNAME to an attacker. This PAM calling sequence is unusual, but
it's known to be used by Solaris 10 su. pam-krb5 3.13 and later will
log an error message and return success without taking any action when
a program attempts to reinitialize credentials in a setuid context.

I'm not aware of any exploits in the wild for either problem, but I have
working exploits for both. An exploit of the first vulnerability is
straightforward for anyone with knowledge of Kerberos. An exploit for the
second vulnerability requires identifying an application that uses the
vulnerable PAM calling sequence but is completely trivial once such an
application has been identified.

These problems have been corrected in pam-krb5 3.13, available from:

> <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/pam-krb5/>

pam-krb5 was released as the libpam-krb5 package with Debian 4.0 (etch).
These vulnerabilities have been fixed in the 2.6-1etch1 version of the
libpam-krb5 Debian package for Debian 4.0. They have also been fixed in
the 3.11-4 package for the upcoming Debian 5.0 (lenny) release and for
Debian unstable (sid).

pam-krb5 linked with the Heimdal Kerberos implementation was also released
as the libpam-heimdal package with Debian 4.0 (etch). This package is not
vulnerable to the first problem (CVE-2009-0360). The second problem
(CVE-2009-0361) has been fixed in the 2.5-1etch1 version of the
libpam-heimdal Debian package for Debian 4.0 and in the 3.10-2.1 version
for the upcoming Debian 5.0 (lenny) release and Debian unstable (sid).

Please accept my personal apologies for these vulnerabilities. The first
vulnerability in particular was an error I should have known about and
fixed some time previous. I even followed a BUGTRAQ discussion of a
closely related problem with Kerberos authentication in sudo, did some
investigation at the time, and apparently forgot or misremembered the
results of my investigation.

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System with Kerberos installed:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R13/R13.1, R14/R14.1, R15 | Low | Kerberos is installed but not configured or used by default on CMS systems.For CMS R13/R14 upgrade to R13.1/R14.1 and install patch 119208-24. For CMS R13.1/R14.1 install patch 119208-24. For CMS R15 install patch 138371-06. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update can be installed. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-719-1: pam-krb5 vulnerabilities

12 February 2009

pam-krb5 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [libpam-krb5](/security/cves?package=libpam-krb5) -

## Details

It was discovered that pam\_krb5 parsed environment variables when run with

setuid applications. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to bypass

authentication checks and gain root privileges. ([CVE-2009-0360](/security/CVE-2009-0360))

Derek Chan discovered that pam\_krb5 incorrectly handled refreshing existing

credentials when used with setuid applications. A local attacker could exploit

this to create or overwrite arbitrary files, and possibly gain root privileges.

([CVE-2009-0361](/security/CVE-2009-0361))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libpam-krb5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libpam-krb5)
  -
  [3.10-1ubuntu0.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libpam-krb5/3.10-1ubuntu0.8.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libpam-krb5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libpam-krb5)
  -
  [3.10-1ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libpam-krb5/3.10-1ubuntu0.8.04.1)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.
