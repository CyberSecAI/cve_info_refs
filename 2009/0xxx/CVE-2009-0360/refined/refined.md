Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `pam_krb5` module, when linked with MIT Kerberos, did not properly initialize the Kerberos libraries for setuid execution. Specifically it was not using `krb5_init_secure_context()`.
*   This improper initialization caused the Kerberos libraries to trust environment variables for locating the Kerberos configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Configuration Handling:** The module incorrectly relied on environment variables for crucial configuration information within a setuid context. This is insecure because environment variables are easily controlled by the user running the process.
*   **Missing Security Checks:** The code lacked proper checks to ensure that it was not running in a setuid/setgid context before attempting to initialize kerberos, thus leading to the use of environment variables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting the `KRB5_CONFIG` environment variable to point to a malicious Kerberos configuration file.
*   By doing so, the attacker could then launch a PAM-based setuid application and bypass authentication checks, gaining elevated privileges (e.g., root access).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Environment Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to control the environment variables of the process being exploited.
*   **Setuid Application:** The attacker must target a setuid application that uses PAM for authentication with the vulnerable `pam_krb5` module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to set environment variables.
*  The attacker needs to identify and use a setuid application which utilizes the vulnerable pam_krb5 module for authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is specific to `pam_krb5` when linked with MIT Kerberos. It is not present when linked with Heimdal Kerberos.
*   The vulnerability was present in all versions of pam-krb5 prior to version 3.13
*   The vulnerability was also present in the Debian libpam-krb5 packages prior to version 2.6-1etch1 (for Debian 4.0/etch) and 3.11-4 (for Debian 5.0/lenny).
*   The vulnerability was also present in Ubuntu's libpam-krb5 package before version 3.10-1ubuntu0.8.04.1
*   The vulnerability was also present in Solaris and OpenSolaris systems that used pam_krb5
