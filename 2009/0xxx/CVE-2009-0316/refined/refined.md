    "information": {
      "root_cause": "Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Python module due to an erroneous setting of sys.path by the PySys_SetArgv function.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "The PySys_SetArgv function prepends the current working directory to the Python module search path (sys.path)."

        "Placing a malicious Python file in the current working directory."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to create files in the current working directory.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the PySys_SetArgv function adds the current working directory to the beginning of the Python module search path, allowing local users to potentially load malicious code by placing files with matching names in the current directory. This issue was discovered in multiple applications including epiphany, csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, and Gnumeric."
