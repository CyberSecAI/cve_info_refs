[+] Exploitation: Remote

[+] Bugs

- [A] Multiple SQL Injection

[-] Requisites: magic_quotes_gpc = off
[-] File affected: viewforum.php, viewtopic.php

This bug allows a guest to view username and
password list.

- [B] Information Disclosure

[-] Requisites: none
[-] File affected: showme.php

This bug allows a guest to view reserved
information of any user.

- [C] Authentication Bypass

[-] Requisites: magic_quotes_gpc = off
[-] File affected: login.php

This bug allows a guest to bypass authentication.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- **SQL Injection:** Improperly sanitized input in `viewforum.php` and `viewtopic.php` allows for arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.
- **Information Disclosure:** `showme.php` allows access to user information without proper authorization checks.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The login form is vulnerable to SQL injection or some logic flaw that allows bypassing authentication via a crafted request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection in `viewforum.php` and `viewtopic.php`
- Information disclosure vulnerability in `showme.php`
- Authentication Bypass in `login.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, including user credentials (usernames and passwords).
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can view sensitive user information.
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to administrative or user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:**  HTTP GET requests to `viewforum.php` and `viewtopic.php` with malicious `id` parameters.
- **Information Disclosure:** HTTP GET request to `showme.php` with the target user's username as a parameter.
- **Authentication Bypass:** HTTP POST request to `login.php` with a crafted `Username` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
- The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off to exploit the SQL Injection and authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
- No other special capabilities or specific network position is needed. The attacker can be remote.
