{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple stack buffer overflows due to unchecked buffer lengths when processing HTML and XML tags.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in the 'EndOfXmlAttributeValue()' function when processing XML attributes with overly long values. Specifically, the `sprintf` function writes to a fixed-size buffer (`msgBuffer`) without checking bounds leading to overflow if the attribute value is too large.",
    "Stack-based buffer overflow in the 'ProcessStartGI()' function triggered by calling 'HTMLParseError()' after processing HTML tags. The error message added to `msgBuffer` exceeds buffer size after being processed in `EndOfStartGI()`.",
     "Multiple unchecked buffers of type 'msgBuffer' throughout the code, using functions like 'strcpy', 'sprintf', etc. without sufficient bounds checking."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution. Specifically mentioned is control of the instruction pointer causing a jump to `0x41414141`.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted web pages containing malicious HTML/XML tags with oversized parameters. Specifically:\n- An `input` HTML tag with an overly long `type` attribute triggers overflow in `EndOfXmlAttributeValue`.\n-  An HTML tag that triggers an error can cause overflow in `ProcessStartGI`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to deliver a crafted web page to the victim. This can be done through a malicious website or an email with a crafted HTML attachment, for instance. No special capabilities are needed beyond crafting the malicious input."
