      Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory

Amaya web editor XML and HTML parser vulnerabilities

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Amaya web editor XML and HTML parser vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-1211
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/amaya-buffer-overflows
Date published: 2009-01-28
Date of last update: 2009-01-26
Vendors contacted: INRIA
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 33046, 33047
CVE Name: N/A

3. *Vulnerability Description*

Amaya is the W3C's Web editor/browser, a tool used to create and update
documents directly on the Web. Multiple stack buffer overflow
vulnerabilities have been discovered in Amaya, which can be exploited by
unauthorized people using crafted web pages to compromise a user's system.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Amaya 11.0 and previous versions.

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Amaya 11.1.

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Patched versions should be downloadable from Amaya's web site [1].

7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Dan Crowley and
Alfredo Ortega from Core Security Technologies.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been discovered in
Amaya web editor/browser [1], which can be exploited by unauthorized
people using crafted web pages to compromise a user's system.

A boundary error when processing 'input' HTML tags can be exploited to
cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long 'type' parameter
(Bugtraq ID 33046). Code analysis of the Amaya XHTML parser reveals
multiple unchecked buffers declared on the stack, one of which is used
in the function 'EndOfXmlAttributeValue()':

/-----------

Xml2thot.c

3247	static void EndOfXmlAttributeValue (char *attrValue)
3248
3249	{
3250	  AttributeType    attrType;
3251	  int            attrKind, val;
3252	  unsigned char    msgBuffer[MaxMsgLength];
3253

.
.
.
3265	      if (val <= 0)
3266	        {
3267	          sprintf ((char *)msgBuffer,
3268	                   "Unknown attribute value \"%s\"", (char
*)attrValue);
3269	          XmlParseError (errorParsing, (unsigned char *)msgBuffer,
0);
3270        }

- -----------/

We can see here that the 'sprintf' function at line 3267 will write on
the buffer 'msgBuffer' if there is an error, but it will never check
that the error message fits the length of that buffer, so if the
attribute exceeds a length of about 170 characters, a buffer overflow
will ensue.

The following page consisting of a single HTML tag is enough to trigger
this vulnerability. This code will control the instruction pointer,
causing the Amaya web editor program to jump to the address '0x41414141':

/-----------

<input
type="aBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBCDaBAAAA">

- -----------/

Other stack-based buffer overflows were discovered.

When reading the HTML in function 'EndOfStartGI()', the length of the
variable 'theGI' is correctly limited to the buffer length.

/-----------

html2toth.c:

2506
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
2507	  EndOfStartGI    An HTML GI has been read in a start tag.
2508
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
2509	static void     EndOfStartGI (char c)
2510	{
2511	  char        theGI[MaxMsgLength];
.
.
.
2538	      strncpy ((char *)theGI, (char *)inputBuffer, MaxMsgLength - 1);
2539	      theGI[MaxMsgLength - 1] = EOS
.
.
.
2596	        ProcessStartGI (theGI);

- -----------/

 But when calling 'ProcessStartGI()', an error message will add 50 extra
characters to this variable (line 2440), and a stack-based buffer
overflow will ensue (Bugtraq ID 33047):

/-----------

2321
/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
2322	  ProcessStartGI  An HTML GI has been read in a start tag.
2323	  Create the corresponding Thot thing (element, attribute,
2324	  or character), according to the mapping table.
2325
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------*/
2326	static void ProcessStartGI (const char* GIname)
2327	{
2331	  char                msgBuffer[MaxMsgLength];

.
.
.

2436	          if (error)
2437	            /* element not allowed in the current structural context */
2438	            {
2439	              /* send an error message */
2440	              sprintf (msgBuffer,
2441	                       "Tag <%s> is not allowed here (removed when
saving)",
2442	                       GIname);
2443	              HTMLParseError (HTMLcontext.doc, msgBuffer, 0);

- -----------/

 This is not an exhaustive enumeration of the stack-based buffer
overflows that can be found in Amaya. Remarkably, in the unpatched
version, files 'html2thot.c' and 'xml2thot.c' contain many general
purpose buffers defined as

/-----------

char msgBuffer[MaxMsgLength]
- -----------/

 and the length of buffers is generally not checked in the functions
using them (i.e. 'strcpy', 'sprintf', etcetera).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
