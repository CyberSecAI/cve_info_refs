Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `decrypt_public` function within the BOINC client software (specifically in `lib/crypt.cpp`). This function calls the OpenSSL `RSA_public_decrypt` function but fails to check its return value. The `RSA_public_decrypt` function returns the size of the recovered message digest on success or -1 on failure. Not checking for the error allows the program to proceed with a potentially invalid signature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Error Handling:** The core issue is the lack of return value checking for the `RSA_public_decrypt` function. This oversight means the software doesn't detect decryption failures.
- **Insecure Signature Verification:** By not properly handling decryption errors, the software could treat a malformed signature as valid.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass Certificate Chain Validation:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass the validation of the certificate chain.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker might perform a man-in-the-middle attack and present a crafted certificate to the BOINC client, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Malformed SSL/TLS Signature:** An attacker crafts a malformed SSL/TLS signature and presents it to the vulnerable BOINC client.
- **Network traffic interception**: An attacker may need to intercept network traffic in order to inject a malicious response to the client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a BOINC client.
- **Knowledge of Malformed Signatures:** The attacker needs to be able to generate or obtain a malformed SSL/TLS signature that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Position (Possibly):**  To fully exploit the vulnerability, an attacker may need to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and server, or have control of a malicious server that the client connects to.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2008-5077, a similar issue found in OpenSSL.
- The vulnerability affects BOINC client versions 6.2.14 and 6.4.5, as well as potentially other versions.
- Patches for this vulnerability were created and deployed, with a focus on adding checks for the `RSA_public_decrypt` return values.
- The issue was addressed in boinc client version 6.2.14-3 for Debian and 6.4.5-2 for Fedora.
