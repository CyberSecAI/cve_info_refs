```
Package: boinc
Severity: serious

Hi,

I've been checking packages to see if they properly check the return
value of some of the functions in openssl.  In lib/crypt.C there
is this code:
int decrypt_public(R_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY& key, DATA_BLOCK& in, DATA_BLOCK& out) {
    RSA* rp = RSA_new();
    public_to_openssl(key, rp);
    RSA_public_decrypt(in.len, in.data, out.data, rp, RSA_PKCS1_PADDING);
    out.len = RSA_size(rp);
    return 0;
}

So it's not checking the return value of RSA_public_decrypt() which
returns the the size of the recovered message digest on success
and -1 on failure.

I have no idea if this code is being used and what the consequences
of this might be.

Kurt

```

and they have introduced another since it may be "en- or decryption", not only
"encryption" as their error message indicates.

Whenever there is the next Debian release, this bug will be closed, I'd say.

Many thanks for spotting this.

They check already for "en- or decryption" as you said, perhaps just
changing ERR_CRYPTO to show this.
I was about to port this fix to 6.2.14-2, are everybody ok with this?

I personally think that you should save your energy. Upstream will release a new version
any time soon. That version will have that patch and I'd wait for that.

FWIW: I'm ok with backporting this to the current version in Lenny.

Lenny should not be without it, good point.  My comment referred to my preference to use a
newer upstream version and keep the Debian packaging bits as simple as possible.

The changes are quite simple, I have this on a local branch, and
planning to merge it with master. I did not change anything on the
Debian packaging, just add a new patch that quilt manage like a breeze.

I'll ask for sponsorship on pkg-boinc after I test the packages.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- boinc-client
The boinc-client was missing return value checks for openssl function
calls. (CVE-2009-0126)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xrdp
This update fixes multiple buffer overflows that can be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5902, CVE-2008-5903,
CVE-2008-5904)
Additionally xrdp does not register remote session as local anymore.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- phpMyAdmin
A version upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.4 to fix various security
bugs. (CVE-2008-2960, CVE-2008-3197, CVE-2008-1149, CVE-2008-1567,
CVE-2008-1924, CVE-2008-4096, CVE-2008-4326, CVE-2008-5621, CVE-2008-5622)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- libnasl
This update of libnasl adds missing return value checks for openssl
function calls. (CVE-2009-0125)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- moodle
Insufficient quoting of wiki page titles allowed attackers to
conduct cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2008-5432)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- net-snmp
Remote attackers could crash net-snmp via GETBULK-Request
(CVE-2008-4309).
In addition the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- typo in error message
- make OIDs longer than 256 chars work
- typo in the snmpd init script to really load all agents
- logrotate config to restart the snmptrapd as well
Affected products: SLES9, NLD9, SLES10, SLED 10
- audiofile
A heap-overflow in libaudiofile was fixed. The overflow existsed
in the WAV processing code and can be exploited to execute arbi-
trary code. (CVE-2008-5824)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- XFree86/xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command
execution was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an
xterm. (CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Support for Matrox G200EV/G200WB cards was added.
Affected products: OES, SLES9, NLD9
- amarok
This update of amarok fixes several integer overflows and unchecked
memory allocations that can be exploited by malformed Audible digital
audio files. These bugs could be used in a user-assisted attack sce-
nario to execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2009-0135, CVE-2009-
0136)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLED10
- libpng
This update of libpng fixes the function png\_check\_keyword() that
allowed setting arbitrary bytes in the process memory to 0.
(CVE-2008-5907)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- sudo
This update of sudo fixes a bug that allowed - depending on the
sudoers rules - a sudo-user to execute arbitrary shell commands as
root. (CVE-2009-0034)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- avahi
Specially crafted mDNS packets could crash the Avahi daemon
(CVE-2008-5081).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED10

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=====================================

Users of OpenSSL 0.9.8 should update to the OpenSSL 0.9.8j release

0.9.8j is working well, we should add test cases for OpenSSL communication on BOINC alpha test
