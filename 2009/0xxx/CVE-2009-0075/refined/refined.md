  "CVE-2009-0075": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the handling of document objects. When an object is appended and deleted in a specific order memory corruption occurs.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uninitialized memory corruption",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to remote compromise of the affected system under the credentials of the currently logged in user. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "By constructing a specially crafted Web page and convincing a user to view it.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to host the malicious page or compromise legitimate websites. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability, the target must visit a malicious page."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has been deleted.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution with user privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "Malicious web page, email or instant message link.",
