Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that occurs when Apple iTunes parses specially crafted `itms:` or `itpc:` URLs. Specifically, a lack of proper bounds checking in the handling of these URLs allows an attacker to overwrite data on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  Data provided in the malicious URL is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without proper validation, enabling overwriting of stack data like return addresses and SEH records.
- **Lack of input validation:** iTunes fails to properly validate the size of the data provided in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By overwriting the return address or SEH handler on the stack, an attacker can redirect program execution to their own code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Unexpected application termination:** If code execution is not achieved, the overflow may lead to a crash of the iTunes application due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing a crafted `itms:` or `itpc:` URL. When a user visits the website, the browser will attempt to open the URL using iTunes, which triggers the overflow.
- **Phishing/Social Engineering:** The malicious `itms:` or `itpc:` URLs could be distributed through social engineering attacks, where users are tricked into opening the URLs via email or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a website or deliver a malicious `itms:` or `itpc:` URL to the victim.
- The victim needs to have iTunes installed on their system and be using a vulnerable version of iTunes (prior to 8.2).
- The attacker needs knowledge of the buffer overflow and its exploitation on the target platform
- In the Windows exploit example, the attacker needs to be able to host a web server as the exploit relies on javascript to initiate the itms:// and itpc:// calls.
- For the Windows exploit the victim must also use Firefox as IE was found to truncate the URI

**Additional details from the provided sources:**
- The exploit-db entries include proof-of-concept code showing how to achieve code execution on both OSX and Windows.
- The Windows exploit bypasses stack canary protection and uses an SEH overwrite to achieve code execution.
- The OSX exploit achieves code execution by overwriting the return address.
- The Apple advisory for iTunes 8.2 confirms the vulnerability and states that it's addressed via improved bounds checking.
- Metasploit has a module to exploit this vulnerability
- The vulnerability was discovered by Rob King of TippingPoint DVLabs and Will Drewry
