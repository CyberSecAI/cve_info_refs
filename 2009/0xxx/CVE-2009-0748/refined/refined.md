  "CVE-2009-0748": {
    "description": "The ext4_fill_super function in fs/ext4/super.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.27 before 2.6.27.19 and 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.7 does not validate the superblock configuration, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by attempting to mount a crafted ext4 filesystem.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ext4_fill_super` function in the ext4 filesystem driver lacks proper validation of the superblock configuration. Specifically, it does not verify the consistency of certain critical fields within the superblock before attempting to use them, such as the block group descriptors.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a malicious ext4 filesystem image with an invalid superblock. When an attempt is made to mount this image, the vulnerable function attempts to access memory via a NULL pointer leading to a kernel crash (oops) and denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access",
         "Mounting of malicious ext4 filesystem image"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create a malformed ext4 filesystem image and to be able to attempt to mount the malicious image on the vulnerable system."
