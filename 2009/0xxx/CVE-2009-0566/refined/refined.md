CVE-2009-0566:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office Publisher opens, imports, and converts files created in versions older than Microsoft Office Publisher 2007. An error in calculating object handler data when opening a specially crafted Publisher file may corrupt system memory, allowing arbitrary code execution.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of object handlers when opening older Publisher files, leading to a pointer dereference vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code, gain complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer user rights would be less affected.
  - Attack vectors:
    - E-mail: Attacker sends a specially crafted Publisher file as an attachment and convinces the user to open it.
    - Web-based: Attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted Publisher file, or a compromised website that hosts such a file. The attacker has to convince the user to visit the website, typically via a link in an email or instant message.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to create a specially crafted Publisher file.
    - Ability to send an email or host a website.
    - Requires user interaction to open the malicious file.
