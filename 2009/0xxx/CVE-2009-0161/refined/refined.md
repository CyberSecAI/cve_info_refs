{
  "CVE-2009-0161": {
    "Description": "An incomplete error check exists in Ruby's use of the OpenSSL library. The OpenSSL::OCSP Ruby module may interpret an invalid response as an OCSP validation of the certificate. This update addresses the issue through improved error checking while verifying OCSP responses.",
    "Root cause": "Incomplete error check in Ruby's OpenSSL library.",
    "Vulnerability": "The OpenSSL::OCSP Ruby module may interpret an invalid response as an OCSP validation of the certificate.",
    "Impact": "Ruby programs may accept revoked certificates.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious attacker could potentially provide a crafted, invalid OCSP response, which the affected Ruby program would interpret as valid.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate the OCSP response that the Ruby program is validating."
