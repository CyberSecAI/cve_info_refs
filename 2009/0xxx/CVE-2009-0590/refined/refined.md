{
  "CVE-2009-0590": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The function `ASN1_STRING_print_ex` in OpenSSL does not properly validate the lengths of BMPString or UniversalString objects before attempting to print them.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation, specifically insufficient length validation of BMPString or UniversalString objects.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An application attempting to print a BMPString or UniversalString with an invalid length will crash due to OpenSSL accessing invalid memory locations. This can lead to a remote denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted SSL certificate or other data containing malformed BMPString or UniversalString objects to a vulnerable application that uses the `ASN1_STRING_print_ex` function.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted data to a vulnerable application. This could be a remote attacker."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient length validations in the ASN.1 handling of the OpenSSL crypto library.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient validation of lengths when handling ASN.1 data, specifically when processing BMPString or UniversalString objects.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a manipulated certificate with invalid lengths.",
       "Attack vectors": "A manipulated certificate containing invalid lengths is sent to vulnerable applications that use OpenSSL for ASN.1 handling.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send malformed certificate to the application"

    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The function ASN1_STRING_print_ex() does not properly validate the lengths of BMPString or UniversalString objects before attempting to print them.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient validation of lengths before printing ASN.1 strings, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "An application that attempts to print a BMPString or UniversalString with an invalid length will crash, which can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a manipulated certificate or ASN.1 structure with invalid lengths that will trigger a crash when printed by the vulnerable function.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send a crafted malformed certificate"
