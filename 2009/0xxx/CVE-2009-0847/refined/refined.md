{
  "CVE-2009-0847": {
    "description": "Multiple memory corruption issues exist in Kerberos' handling of ASN.1 encoded messages. Processing a maliciously crafted ASN.1 encoded message may lead to a denial of service of a Kerberos-enabled program or arbitrary code execution. Further information on the issues and the patches applied is available via the MIT Kerberos website at <http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/>",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "An incorrect length check inside an ASN.1 decoder leads to spurious malloc() failures or crashes.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Incorrect length check in ASN.1 decoder",
        "Potential for spurious malloc() failures",
        "Potential for crashes due to large malloc() calls or memory access issues"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service or arbitrary code execution of a Kerberos-enabled program (kinit or KDC).",
      "attack_vectors": "Processing of a maliciously crafted ASN.1 encoded message via network request.",
