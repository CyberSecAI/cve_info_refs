Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2009-0946 from the provided content:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Multiple integer overflows exist in FreeType, a library used for processing font files. These overflows occur in different functions:
    *   `cff_charset_load` in `cff/cffload.c`
    *   `tt_cmap8_validate`, `tt_cmap10_validate`, `tt_cmap12_validate`, `tt_cmap_14_validate` in `sfnt/ttcmap.c`
    *   `ft_smooth_render_generic` in `smooth/ftsmooth.c`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer overflows:** The core issue is that certain calculations within FreeType do not properly handle large values, leading to integer overflows.
*   **Heap or Stack Based Buffer Overflows:** These integer overflows can result in heap- or stack-based buffer overflows.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running the application.
*   **Application Crashes:** The vulnerabilities may also lead to application crashes due to the resulting buffer overflows.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can also cause a denial of service by triggering these vulnerabilities, potentially crashing the application or system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted Font Files:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or application into processing a specially crafted font file (e.g., CFF, TTF). This could be achieved by:
    *   Embedding the malicious font in a document (e.g., PDF).
    *   Hosting the font on a malicious website and rendering it in a browser.
    *   Delivering a malicious font as an attachment.
    *   Other techniques that trick a victim application into parsing a malformed font file.
*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely, as an attacker can supply a malicious font file over a network.
*   **Local exploitation:** In some cases, exploitation may be possible through local access when a user processes a malformed font file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to deliver a crafted font file:** Attackers need to be able to deliver a malicious font file to the victim's system.
*   **User interaction or automated system processing:** The vulnerability can be exploited when a user opens or processes a malicious font file, either through a user action or through automated processing by a system.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Systems:** The vulnerability affects a wide range of operating systems and software that utilize the vulnerable versions of FreeType, including:
    *   Debian Linux (etch, lenny)
    *   Ubuntu Linux (various versions)
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (various versions)
    *   Apple iOS (versions 1.0 through 2.2.1)
    *   Apple Mac OS X (various versions)
    *   Gentoo Linux
    *   openSUSE
    *   Mozilla Firefox (versions prior to 3.0.9)
    *   Other applications utilizing the FreeType library

*   **Specific Functions Affected:** The reports and patches identify the specific functions within FreeType that are vulnerable to the overflows.
*   **Patches and Updates:** The various sources describe the patches and software updates required to address the issue, including links to the relevant updates for each affected distribution.
*   **Upstream fixes:** The vulnerability was fixed upstream by the FreeType project, and distributors use these fixes to produce patches for their respective distributions.

In summary, CVE-2009-0946 is a serious vulnerability involving integer overflows within the FreeType library. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or denial of service. The attack vector is through crafted font files that can be delivered through various methods.
