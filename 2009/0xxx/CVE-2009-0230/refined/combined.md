How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

MS09-022 Vulnerabilities in Windows Print Spooler Could Allow Remote
Code Execution (961501)

Original Release Date: June 10, 2009

Last Revised: June 10, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-217

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin which contained security
advisory MS09-022. This security update resolves vulnerabilities in
Windows Print Spooler. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote
code execution if an affected server received a specially crafted RPC
request. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2009-0228](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0228),
[CVE-2009-0229](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0229) and
[CVE-2009-0230](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0230)
to these issues. A description of the vulnerabilities may be found
at:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-022.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be
affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an
Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system
products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating
System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Application Server | All | Medium | Avaya recommends that customers install the security update as provided via Microsoft Windows Update. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that
customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update can be installed. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose
operating systems. Occasionally
vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or applications that come with the operating system.
These vulnerabilities often do not impact the
software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of
the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are
not affected by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Microsoft
Windows
platform may be. For affected Microsoft Operating Systems,
Microsoft recommends installing patches. Detailed instructions for
patching the Operating System are given by Microsoft at the following
link:

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Print Spooler Could Allow Remote Code Execution (961501)

Published: June 09, 2009 | Updated: June 17, 2009

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Windows Print Spooler. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an affected server received a specially crafted RPC request. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000; Moderate for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003; and Important for all supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing the way the print spooler parses certain printing data structures, limiting the location where separator pages or embedded files can be read by the Windows Printing Service, and restricting the paths from which the print spooler can load a DLL. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

## Buffer Overflow in Print Spooler Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0228

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows Print Spooler that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0228](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0228).

#### Mitigating Factors for Buffer Overflow in Print Spooler Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0228

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Buffer Overflow in Print Spooler Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0228

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service
* **On Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4, remove the Print Spooler service from the NullSessionPipes registry key**

  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 allows anonymous connections to the affected service. To help prevent attempts to exploit this vulnerability by anonymous attackers, remove the Print Spooler Service from the NullSessionPipes subkey. This workaround will not prevent attacks from authenticated users. Use this workaround only if you cannot disable the Printer Spooler service.

  **Warning** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to modify the registry, view the "Change Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you modify it

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedt32** and then click **OK.**
  2. In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\NullSessionPipes
  3. Edit the registry key and remove the **SPOOLSS** value.
  4. Restart the affected system after performing these actions.

  **Impact of workaround.** Anonymous connections to the Print Spooler service will not be allowed. This is the default behavior of later operating system versions.
* **Disable the Print Spooler service**

  Disabling the Print Spooler service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Print Spooler service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel.**
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Print Spooler**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

  You can also stop and disable the Print Spooler service by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop Spooler & sc config Spooler start=disabled`

  **Impact of workaround.** If you disable the Print Spooler service, you cannot print locally or remotely. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that do not require printing.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To enable the Print Spooler service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel.**
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Print Spooler**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Automatic.**
  6. Click **Start**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for Buffer Overflow in Print Spooler Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0228

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Print Spooler contains a buffer overflow due to the improper parsing of certain printing data structures.

**What is the Print Spooler service?**

The Print Spooler service is an executable file that is installed as a service. The spooler is loaded when the operating system starts, and it continues to run until the operating system is shut down. The Print Spooler service manages the printing process, which includes such tasks as retrieving the location of the correct printer driver, loading that driver, spooling high-level function calls into a print job, and scheduling print jobs. When the tasks for a particular print job are complete, the Print Spooler service passes the job to the print router. For more information, see the TechNet article, [How Network Printing Works](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/d58ce7b9-49cf-4f5e-95e9-1ade005c13e0).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a user's system with system privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

For remote code execution to occur, an attacker would first need to set up a malicious print server that can be accessed by an affected system. The attacker could then send a specially crafted RPC request to the affected system that would cause the affected system to improperly parse the ShareName on the attacker's print server during enumeration. This would allow the attacker to perform remote code execution on the affected system with system-level privileges.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way the print spooler parses certain printing data structures.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for Print Spooler Read File Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0229

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read or print any file on the system. This action could be taken even if the user does not have administrative access.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Printing Service does not properly check the files that can be included with separator pages.

**What is the Print Spooler service?**

The Print Spooler service is an executable file that is installed as a service. The spooler is loaded when the operating system starts, and it continues to run until the operating system is shut down. The Print Spooler service manages the printing process, which includes such tasks as retrieving the location of the correct printer driver, loading that driver, spooling high-level function calls into a print job, and scheduling print jobs. When the tasks for a particular print job are complete, the Print Spooler service passes the job to the print router. For more information, see the TechNet article, [How Network Printing Works](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/d58ce7b9-49cf-4f5e-95e9-1ade005c13e0).

**What is a separator page?**

A separator or banner page typically states who sent the document to the printer and gives the date and time of printing. You can use one of the standard separator pages or create a custom page. Windows provides three separator page files, which are located in the %systemroot%\System32 folder. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Using separator pages](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc737357.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read or print any file on an affected system. The attacker would not have the ability to change the contents of a file.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then create a specially crafted separator page that included any file from the system that the attacker wanted to include in the print request.

On all versions of Microsoft Windows, the attacker needs the "Manage Printer" privilege to exploit this issue. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the local user is automatically given this permission if they install a local printer. This can be accomplished without administrative privileges if the printer driver is included by default.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by limiting the location where separator pages and embedded files will be read by the Windows Printing Service.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Print Spooler Load Library Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0230

A remote, authenticated elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Print Spooler that could allow an arbitrary dynamic link library (DLL) to be loaded by the Print Spooler. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0230](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0230).

#### Mitigating Factors for Print Spooler Load Library Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0230

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* Only authenticated users can trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability can only be triggered if the user can authenticate against the remote system. However, if the Guest account is enabled, then guest users can trigger this vulnerability as well.
* On all versions of Microsoft Windows, the attacker needs the "Manage Printer" privilege to exploit this vulnerability. On Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the local user is automatically given this permission when installing a local printer. This can be accomplished without administrative privileges if the printer driver is included by default.

#### Workarounds for Print Spooler Load Library Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0230

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the Print Spooler service**

  Disabling the Print Spooler service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Print Spooler service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel.**
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Print Spooler**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.

  You can also stop and disable the Print Spooler service by using the following command at the command prompt:

  `sc stop Spooler & sc config Spooler start=disabled`

  **Impact of workaround.** If you disable the Print Spooler service, you cannot print locally or remotely. Therefore, we recommend this workaround only on systems that do not require printing.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To enable the Print Spooler service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel.**
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Print Spooler**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Automatic.**
  6. Click **Start**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for Print Spooler Load Library Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0230

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Print Spooler does not properly validate the paths from which a DLL may be loaded.

**What is the Print Spooler service?**

The Print Spooler service is an executable file that is installed as a service. The spooler is loaded when the operating system starts, and it continues to run until the operating system is shut down. The Print Spooler service manages the printing process, which includes such tasks as retrieving the location of the correct printer driver, loading that driver, spooling high-level function calls into a print job, and scheduling print jobs. When the tasks for a particular print job are complete, the Print Spooler service passes the job to the print router. For more information, see the TechNet article, [How Network Printing Works](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/d58ce7b9-49cf-4f5e-95e9-1ade005c13e0).

**What is a DLL?**

A dynamic-link library (DLL) is a module that contains functions and data that can be used by another module (application or DLL). A DLL can define two kinds of functions: exported and internal. The exported functions are intended to be called by other modules, as well as from within the DLL where they are defined. Internal functions are typically intended to be called only from within the DLL where they are defined. Although a DLL can export data, its data is generally used only by its functions. However, there is nothing to prevent another module from reading or writing that address. DLLs provide a way to modularize applications so that their functionality can be updated and reused more easily. DLLs also help reduce memory overhead when several applications use the same functionality at the same time, because although each application receives its own copy of the DLL data, the applications share the DLL code. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Libraries](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682589.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with the same rights as the Windows Print Spooler. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to store a malicious DLL in a location that is accessible by the print spooler. The attacker would then create a specially crafted RPC message and send the message to an affected system. The message would cause the print spooler to load the malicious DLL and execute code with elevated privileges.

On all versions of Microsoft Windows, the attacker needs the "Manage Printer" privilege to exploit this issue. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the local user is automatically given this permission when installing a local printer. This can be accomplished without administrative privileges if the printer driver is included by default.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems configured as print servers are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by restricting the paths from which the print spooler can load a DLL.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
