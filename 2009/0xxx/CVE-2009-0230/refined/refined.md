Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0230:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Windows Print Spooler not properly validating the paths from which a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) may be loaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper DLL Path Validation:** The print spooler doesn't sufficiently check the locations from where it loads DLLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same rights as the Windows Print Spooler service, which runs with elevated privileges.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Authenticated:** The attack is initiated remotely but requires the attacker to be authenticated on the target system.
*   **Malicious DLL Loading:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a location that the print spooler can access.
*   **Specially Crafted RPC Message:** The attacker sends a specially crafted Remote Procedure Call (RPC) message to the affected system, which triggers the print spooler to load and execute the malicious DLL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate against the targeted system. If the Guest account is enabled, guest users can trigger this vulnerability as well.
*    **"Manage Printer" Privilege:** The attacker needs the "Manage Printer" privilege to exploit this issue on all versions of Microsoft Windows. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, local users are automatically granted this permission when installing a local printer with default driver.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the target system remotely over a network.
*   **File Write Access:** The attacker needs to write a malicious DLL to a location accessible to the Print Spooler.
