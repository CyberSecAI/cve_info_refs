  "CVE-2009-0029": {
    "description": "The ABI in the Linux kernel on s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips 64-bit platforms requires that a 32-bit argument in a 64-bit register was properly sign extended when sent from a user-mode application, but cannot verify this, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted system call.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Linux kernel on certain 64-bit architectures (s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips) does not verify if 32-bit arguments passed in 64-bit registers are correctly sign-extended by user-mode applications, as required by the ABI. This leads to potential vulnerabilities because the kernel could misinterpret these arguments due to the missing sign extension.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of system call arguments",
        "Lack of validation of user-provided data",
        "Incorrect assumption about user-space behavior"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain elevated privileges. By providing a 32-bit argument in a 64-bit register that is not correctly sign-extended, an attacker could trigger a kernel crash by accessing memory locations outside the intended range, or potentially exploit this condition to gain elevated privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted system calls with manipulated arguments"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Local user privileges are required to execute the malicious system calls. Specific understanding of the target architecture's calling convention is required to craft the malicious system calls"
    },
    "affected_architectures": [
      "alpha",
      "mips",
      "powerpc",
      "s390",
      "sparc64"
    ],
      "notes": "This vulnerability affects 64-bit kernels with 32 bit arguments. x86_64 and Intel Itanium are not affected."
