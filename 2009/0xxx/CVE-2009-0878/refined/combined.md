### Bug Description

Binary package hint: wesnoth

Please find attached a proposed diff for fixing the CVE-2009-0367 problem in wesnoth for the hardy release. It also closes a memory exhaustion fix which might deeply influence the system of a user loading a special crafted map.

Comparing the fixes that Debian performed[1], I think this patch may additionally require fixes for CVE-2009-0366. Also, please follow the changelog format in the Security Update Procedures[2], since that will make it easier for us to examine the patches.

I do have a worry that just ripping out Python is the wrong approach to take with this bug, as that drops features as well. However, in the light of upstream's response to the bug (they did the same), I think it makes sense. Will there be AIs that no longer work if this code is removed from wesnoth?

Not in this version because it doesn't support gzip compression, so the

changes aren't that big. Additionally, the code has changed a fair bit

through the gzip compression addition and I wasn't able to locate the

specific code sections with some quick search. But given that the

execution of arbitrary code on client machines is a fair bit more severe

than this issue I think it's more than acceptable to \_not\_ delay the

python fix any further.

I'm sorry, I'm no MOTU, I can't sign the Ubuntu CoC because with that I

would claim to expect Mark to be perfect, so I haven't tried to dig

further into Ubuntu practises. I just wanted to offer in a best-effort

manner what could help you to get the problem fixed. If you are fine

with letting the users vulnerable to arbitrary code execution that's

fine with me.

And I'm not completely sure why the style of the changelog should

actually make it easier to examine the patch - but then, that might be

just me.

It drops a feature that is dropped in the upcoming 1.6 release and

never really was used anywhere at all but only a single scenario in a

single campaign (which was fixed with the update too, take a look at the

changes that went into jaunty). All user created stuff that is available

through the wesnoth addon server was checked, and given that the

community is pretty tight this is a quite complete check.

Furthermore, if you know a way to properly sandbox python, feel free to

bring it up. The wesnoth team has quite some python evangelists on board

but they were unable to find a way to sanely limit python. Additionally,

it is discussed to replace this feature with a scripting language that

is actually intended to be run in such an environment - so it might come

back eventually (even if it wasn't really used ...).

You might rather want to take a look of this changelog (the one that

went into unstable, not experimental, and through that into jaunty):

<http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/w/wesnoth/wesnoth_1.4.7-4/changelog>

now consider incomplete...) to ease your work for a distribution that I
can't upload to and propably won't be able to do so for a long time (see
CoC issue above). If you don't have interest to get the issue fixed
that's fine with me - I tried to do my best, if that's not enough, I'm
sorry for that.
Slightly disappointed, both from being exhausted and the delay in response.

This isn't so much about 'pleasing us enough' as about ensuring the patch is correct and well tested. This package is in universe and is community supported and as such, needs caring people like yourself to tend to it. I'm reviewing the patches today and will report back if I have any questions.

Based on your feedback I am going to push the updates for Gutsy and Hardy today. If you are able, perhaps you could prepare a debdiff to fix both CVE-2009-0366 and CVE-2009-0367 on Intrepid. Thanks for your hard work on this!

I can't completely follow. Is six different patched versions that I did

for Debian (1.2, 1.4.4 (twice in different environment), 1.4.7 (twice in

different environment), 1.5.11) not well enough tested for you? Is the

acceptance by the Debian security team in a DSA not well enough tested

for you?

I really thought I did so - but it's your call to accept it, not mine.

Sure, you're welcome. Btw., for completeness:

#v+

+ - Pull limit-mapsize patch from upstream svn r32987 to avoid hanging of

+ wesnoth/exhausting system memory (Upstream [Bug #13031](/bugs/13031))

#v-

This part in the changelog received a CVE ID in the meantime:

CVE-2009-0878 - you might want to incorporate that into the changelog.

I didn't prepare a patch for intrepid because I was told that there is

an update in intrepid-proposed already and I haven't received any

informations about on which version I should base the patch on - the one

actually \_in\_ intrepid, or the version in intrepid-proposed. About the

backports I guess it's just similar to Debian backports: Taking the new

(security) upload and building it for there, so most propably no patch

needed there, right?

I also know that wesnoth is in universe and don't receive regular

security support - on the other hand, this issue isn't a random DoS but

a arbitrary code execution issue that shouldn't get ignored like it was

in the last weeks. I'm quite a bit disappointed here both with the

delays and with the kind of responses, to say the least. :/

Thanks anyway.

Rhonda, no one is criticizing your work. To the contrary, you have done great work with this. The aforementioned testing is needed to be done on Ubuntu because Ubuntu != Debian. Granted, it will most likely work ok but there have been quite a few times when a tested Debian patch didn't work properly on Ubuntu, due to different versions.

The Ubuntu Security team does not have the resources to patch and test software in universe and multiverse and relies on MOTU Swat and people from the community to maintain this software. I apologize for the delays and am working to get these fixes into Ubuntu.

As for Intrepid, please patch the current version as released in Ubuntu, and add a note to the SRU bug for the -proposed package saying it has to be updated to incorporate these security fixes. Please use a version higher than that in -proposed, following the guidelines in <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityUpdateProcedures>.

I backported the fixes from Jaunty and created the following debdiff and am building it. It would be great if someone could take a look at it and make sure it is ok.

Thanks, this looks almost identical to the patch I was working on. Your

last mail motivated me to give it a try and I just didn't check for the

specific format wishes for the changelog from the wiki page yet - was

busy with getting the 1.6a hotfix release uploaded to Debian and planed

to do it afterwards.

I can confirm that the patch is technically the same that I would have

proposed. Really big thanks to you Jamie for picking it up.

All the best to you, and again: thanks!

Rhonda

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: wesnoth

Please sync wesnoth 1:1.4.7-4 (universe) from Debian unstable (main)

wesnoth (1:1.4.7-4) unstable; urgency=high

   \* Upload to fix several severe problems:

     - Compile with --disable-python because the python AI support allowed to

       break out of sandbox and allowed execution of abitrary code

       (CVE-2009-0367, Upstream [Bug #13048](/bugs/13048)). Don't install data/ais into

       wesnoth-data package anymore, and remove python-dev from

       Build-Dependencies.

     - Pull wesnoth-did-ai-fix patch from upstream svn r33013 to make it still

       work after above changes.

     - Pull limit-mapsize patch from upstream svn r32987 to avoid hanging of

       wesnoth/exhausting system memory (Upstream [Bug #13031](/bugs/13031))

   \* Pulled patch fix-server-dos from upstream svn r33069 which fixes a DoS

     pattern in the server, which came in a bit too late for the release

     (CVE-2009-0366, Upstream [Bug #13037](/bugs/13037))

   \* Fix typo in wesnoth-tools package description noticed by Soliton, thanks.

 -- Gerfried Fuchs <email address hidden> Tue, 24 Feb 2009 16:04:59 +0100

Thanks

Thanks for this, Dylan. I was about to look around for one of my usual suspects to ping them about the issue. Glad I didn't have to do that. :)

Ah yes, if you need help with extracting/applying the diff for the

other ubuntu releases, just give me a call and I'll take a look what I

can do. Please don't forget about them. :)
