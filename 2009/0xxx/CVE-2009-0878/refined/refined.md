Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0878:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of map sizes within the `read_game_map` function located in `src/terrain_translation.cpp` and `terrain_translation.hpp`. This allows for the possibility of supplying a crafted map with excessively large dimensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary weakness is the potential for a DoS attack. Loading a specially crafted map with an extremely large size can cause the game to hang or exhaust system memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition, where users loading crafted maps may experience a hang or crash of the game client due to excessive memory consumption.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Crafted Map File:** The attack vector involves an attacker creating or modifying a game map to have an extremely large size. This malicious map would be loaded by the victim user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Map Creation/Modification:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify map files that can be loaded by the vulnerable software.
- **Distribution of Malicious Map:** The attacker needs to distribute the crafted map to the targeted user, for example by hosting it on a server.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this issue involves implementing a size verification check within the `terrain_translation.cpp` and `terrain_translation.hpp` files to ensure that loaded maps are within reasonable limits, preventing excessive memory allocation.
- The provided content also shows the fix for CVE-2009-0367 (arbitrary code execution via Python AI) and CVE-2009-0366 (DoS via large compressed WML).
- The patch for CVE-2009-0878 was initially identified as "limit-mapsize patch from upstream svn r32987".
- The issue is addressed by incorporating the patch in Ubuntu releases of wesnoth, specifically Gutsy, Hardy and Intrepid.
- The fix is described as "Pull limit-mapsize patch from upstream svn r32987 to avoid hanging of wesnoth/exhausting system memory".
