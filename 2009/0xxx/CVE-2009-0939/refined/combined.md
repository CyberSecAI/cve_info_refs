# Tor: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200904-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Tor might allow for heap corruption, Denial of
Service, escalation of privileges and information disclosure.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/tor** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.2.0.34** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.2.0.34** |

### Background

Tor is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a
connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.

### Description

* Theo de Raadt reported that the application does not properly drop
  privileges to the primary groups of the user specified via the "User"
  configuration option (CVE-2008-5397).
* rovv reported that the "ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses" configuration
  option is not always enforced (CVE-2008-5398).
* Ilja van Sprundel reported a heap-corruption vulnerability that might
  be remotely triggerable on some platforms (CVE-2009-0414).
* It has been reported that incomplete IPv4 addresses are treated as
  valid, violating the specification (CVE-2009-0939).
* Three unspecified vulnerabilities have also been reported
  (CVE-2009-0936, CVE-2009-0937, CVE-2009-0938).

### Impact

A local attacker could escalate privileges by leveraging unintended
supplementary group memberships of the Tor process. A remote attacker
could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a heap corruption with
unknown impact and attack vectors, to cause a Denial of Service via CPU
consuption or daemon crash, and to weaken anonymity provided by the
service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tor-0.2.0.34"
```

# Tor 0.2.0.34 is released (security fixes)

* *From*: Roger Dingledine <arma@xxxxxxx>
* *Date*: Mon, 9 Feb 2009 18:12:15 -0500
* *Delivered-to*: archiver@xxxxxxxx

```
Tor 0.2.0.34 features several more security-related fixes. You
should upgrade, especially if you run an exit relay (remote crash) or
a directory authority (remote infinite loop), or you're on an older
(pre-XP) or not-recently-patched Windows (remote exploit).

This release marks end-of-life for Tor 0.1.2.x. Those Tor versions have
many known flaws, and nobody should be using them. You should upgrade. If
you're using a Linux or BSD and its packages are obsolete, stop using
those packages and upgrade anyway.

<https://www.torproject.org/download.html>

Changes in version 0.2.0.34 - 2009-02-08
  o Security fixes:
    - Fix an infinite-loop bug on handling corrupt votes under certain
      circumstances. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha.
    - Fix a temporary DoS vulnerability that could be performed by
      a directory mirror. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha; reported by lark.
    - Avoid a potential crash on exit nodes when processing malformed
      input. Remote DoS opportunity. Bugfix on 0.2.0.33.
    - Do not accept incomplete ipv4 addresses (like 192.168.0) as valid.
      Spec conformance issue. Bugfix on Tor 0.0.2pre27.

  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Fix compilation on systems where time_t is a 64-bit integer.
      Patch from Matthias Drochner.
    - Don't consider expiring already-closed client connections. Fixes
      bug 893. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre20.
