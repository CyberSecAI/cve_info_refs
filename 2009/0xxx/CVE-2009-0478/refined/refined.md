It confirms the vulnerability as a denial of service due to a client-initiated request that causes an assertion failure in the squid child process, leading to its termination. It also notes that the vulnerability is present in Squid versions 2.7 and above. Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not affected. Patches were provided for Fedora 9 and 10.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The root cause is a client request triggering an assertion in the squid child process, due to improper handling of certain malformed requests.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of crafted client requests leading to an assert() failure.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Successful exploitation results in the termination of the squid child process, causing a denial of service until the process restarts.\n\nAttack vectors: The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted client request to the vulnerable Squid server.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send requests to the Squid server."

The advisory states that the vulnerability allows for remote DoS attacks through HTTP requests with invalid version numbers. It also mentions a related issue (CVE-2007-6239) that was fixed improperly in the past.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to improper handling of invalid HTTP version numbers in client requests, triggering an assertion failure.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability enables remote denial of service attacks via crafted HTTP requests.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Successful attacks will cause the service to become unavailable.\n\nAttack vectors: The attack is carried out by sending an HTTP request with an invalid HTTP version number.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Squid server."

  "summary": "CVE-2009-0478 is a Denial of Service vulnerability in Squid proxy server. The vulnerability occurs due to improper parsing of the HTTP version number in client requests, specifically, when malformed or invalid HTTP version numbers are used. This leads to an assertion error causing the squid child process to terminate. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests with invalid version numbers, resulting in a denial of service. Versions of Squid 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1 are affected by this vulnerability. The vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.7.STABLE6, 3.0.STABLE13, and 3.1.0.5.",
