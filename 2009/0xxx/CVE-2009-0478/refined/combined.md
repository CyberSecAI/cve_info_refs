How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=484246#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-02-05 16:24:59 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way squid handles certain client initiated requests. A client who can connect to the squid server could leverage this flaw to cause the squid child process to terminate. This would prevent anyone from using the squid server until the process automatically restarts.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=484246#c2)  Josh Bressers    2009-02-05 16:40:18 UTC  ``` The issue here is that a client request could be constructed in such a way that it triggers a call to assert() in the squid child process.  This then causes the child process to quit, stopping all current requests until the child process is restarted.  As this end up calling assert(), there is no potential for code execution from this particular flaw.  The code that triggers this flaw is only present in squid versions 2.7 and above.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=484246#c4)  Jonathan Steffan    2009-02-10 04:42:31 UTC  ``` <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/squid-3.0.STABLE13-1.fc10> <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/squid-3.0.STABLE13-1.fc9>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=484246#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-02-11 07:31:51 UTC  ``` Official Statement from Red Hat (02/09/2009)     Not vulnerable.

| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.6** |

### Background

Squid is a full-featured web proxy cache.

### Description

* The arrayShrink function in lib/Array.c can cause an array to
  shrink to 0 entries, which triggers an assert error. NOTE: this issue
  is due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2007-6239 (CVE-2008-1612).
* An invalid version number in a HTTP request may trigger an
  assertion in HttpMsg.c and HttpStatusLine.c (CVE-2009-0478).

### Impact

The issues allows for Denial of Service attacks against the service via
an HTTP request with an invalid version number and other specially
crafted requests.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-2.7.6"

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dhcp
By sending requests with a large value for 'dhcp-max-message-size'
dhcp-clients could crash dhcpd if dhcpd was configured with a large
amount of DHCP options (CVE-2007-0062).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ntp/xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
Packages for SLES10 got delayed due a fix for another problem and
will follow soon
- squid
A denial of service condition in HTTP-request processing
was fixed in squid (CVE-2009-0478).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- wireshark
wireshark could crash while reading capture files containing
NetScreen data (CVE-2009-0599), while reading Tektronix K12 capture
files (CVE-2009-0600) or if the HOME environment variable contained
format string specifiers (CVE-2009-0601).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libpng
Specially crafted png files could crash applications using libpng or
potentially execute arbitrary code by causing free of an
uninitialized pointer (CVE-2009-0040).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- pam\_mount
Temporary file handling of the passwdehd script was prone to symlink
attacks (CVE-2008-5138). In 11.0 and 11.1 the script was removed as
it doesn't work on those distributions anyways.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- enscript
long path names could overflow a buffer in enscript (CVE-2008-5078).
Affected Products: SLES9
- eID-belgium
eID-belgium didn't properly check the return value of the openssl
function EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0049).
Affected Products: SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-good
Specially crafted QuickTime media files could cause heap based
buffer overflows in gstreamer. Attackers could potentially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0386, CVE-2009-0387,
CVE-2009-0397).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
