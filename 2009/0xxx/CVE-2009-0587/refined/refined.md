Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the base64 encoding and decoding functions within `evolution-data-server` (specifically in `camel-mime-utils.c` and `addressbook/libebook/e-vcard.c`). The memory allocation for the output buffer uses a calculation of `user_supplied_length * 3 / 4 + some_small_num`. Due to the order of operations, the multiplication by 3 occurs before the division by 4.  This can lead to an integer overflow when `user_supplied_length` is large, resulting in an undersized buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the potential for an integer overflow during buffer allocation size calculation.
*   **Heap Overflow:** An undersized buffer on the heap is allocated due to the incorrect size calculation, this can lead to a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `evolution-data-server`.
*   **Denial of Service:** A specially crafted message could cause a crash of evolution data server due to the heap overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Data:** The attack vector is through crafted base64 encoded messages.
*   **Image Files:** An attacker could potentially embed malicious base64 encoded data into image files which are then opened using the vulnerable application.
*   **Malicious Servers:** Connecting to a malicious server that sends overly long base64 encoded data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction/Network Access:** The attacker either needs the user to interact with specially crafted data or to be tricked into connecting to a malicious server.
*   **Crafted Input:**  The attacker needs to be able to create large base64 encoded strings that will trigger the overflow.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects various versions of `evolution-data-server`, `glib` and related libraries (`gst-plugins-base`,`libsoup`). The vulnerable code may exist within other libraries due to code sharing or duplication.
*   **Patches:** Patches are available for `glib`, `gst-plugins-base`, `evolution-data-server` and `libsoup`.
*   **Timeline:** The timeline indicates that the vulnerability was reported in October 2008, and fixes and advisories were released in March 2009.
*   **Credit:**  The initial report and analysis were provided by Diego Petten√≤, with extended analysis and patches from Tomas Hoger.
