Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `gigcal_gigs_id` parameter of the Joomla! Component gigCalendar version 1.0.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `gigcal_gigs_id` parameter.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
    *   Retrieval of sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords stored in the database (`jos_users` table).
    *   Potential modification or deletion of data in the database.
    *   Potential full compromise of the application and server.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessed through the `gigcal_gigs_id` parameter in the URL.
    *   Example: `http://localhost/Path/index.php?option=com_gigcal&task=details&gigcal_gigs_id=[Exploit]`
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the web application.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, since the vulnerable parameter can be directly manipulated in the URL.
    *   The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional details:**

* The provided exploit payload demonstrates how to use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table, which is a typical method for exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in Joomla! sites.
* The exploit includes a live demonstration URL which allows an attacker to retrieve the username and password from the vulnerable website.
* A Google dork is provided for finding potentially vulnerable instances of the software: `inurl:com_gigcal`
