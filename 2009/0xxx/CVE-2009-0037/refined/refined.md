{
  "CVE-2009-0037": {
    "Description": "The curl utility, when following HTTP redirects, does not restrict the target URL protocol. This allows a remote attacker to force curl to follow redirects to file:// URLs, allowing the attacker to read or write local files.",
    "Root cause": "The curl utility, when configured to follow URL redirects automatically, does not validate the protocol of the new target location, allowing redirects to file:// URLs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted URL redirects",
      "Lack of protocol validation for redirects"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can read or write arbitrary local files by tricking the user or automated system into opening a URL to an untrusted server.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "A user or automated system is tricked into opening a URL to an untrusted server, which redirects to a file:// URL.",
       "A remote HTTP server triggers a request to a local server using redirects and file:// URLs."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a server that can send HTTP redirects. The attacker can also attempt to induce a user to load a malicious URL via various methods."
