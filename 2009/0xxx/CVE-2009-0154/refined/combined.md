# Advisory Details

May 13th, 2009
## Apple OS X ATSServer Compact Font Format Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability

### ZDI-09-023ZDI-CAN-462

| CVE ID | [CVE-2009-0154](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0154) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Apple](http://www.apple.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw appears to exist in the ATSServer font server upon parsing of malicious Compact Font Format files. A boundary condition exists in the parsing of internal dictionaries that can lead to a memory corruption allowing the execution of arbitrary code. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3549> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2009-03-19 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2009-05-13 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

#### Security Update 2009-002 / Mac OS X v10.5.7

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2939

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by applying the Apache patch for version 2.0.63. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/> Apache 2.0.x is only shipped with Mac OS X Server v10.4.x systems. Mac OS X v10.5.x and Mac OS X Server v10.5.x ship with Apache 2.2.x.

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2939

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache 2.2.9's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by updating Apache to version 2.2.11. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/>

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-0456

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Web sites that allow users to control the name of a served file may be vulnerable to HTTP response injection

  Description: A request forgery issue exists in Apache. Apache does not escape filenames when negotiating the correct content type to send to a remote browser. A user who can publish files with specially crafted names to a web site can substitute their own response for any web page hosted on the system. This update addresses the issue by escaping filenames in content negotiation responses.

* **ATS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0154

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded CFF font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of Compact Font Format (CFF) fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded CFF font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Charlie Miller of Independent Security Evaluators working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue.

* **BIND**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0025

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: BIND is susceptible to a spoofing attack if configured to use DNSSEC

  Description: BIND incorrectly checks the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protocol, a maliciously crafted DSA certificate could bypass the validation, which may lead to a spoofing attack. By default, DNSSEC is not enabled. This update addresses the issue by updating BIND to version 9.3.6-P1 on Mac OS X v10.4, and version 9.4.3-P1 for Mac OS X v10.5 systems. Further information is available via the ISC web site at <https://www.isc.org/>

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0144

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Applications that use CFNetwork may send secure cookies in unencrypted HTTP requests

  Description: An implementation issue exists in CFNetwork's parsing of Set-Cookie headers, which may result in certain cookies being unexpectedly sent over a non-encrypted connection. This issue affects non-RFC compliant Set-Cookie headers that are accepted for compatibility reasons. This may result in applications that use CFNetwork, such as Safari, sending sensitive information in unencrypted HTTP requests. This update addresses the issue through improved parsing of Set-Cookie headers. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Andrew Mortensen of the University of Michigan for reporting this issue.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0157

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of overly long HTTP headers in CFNetwork. Visiting a malicious website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of HTTP headers. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Moritz Jodeit of n.runs AG for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0145

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues exist in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues through improved bounds and error checking.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0155

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An integer underflow in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files may result in a heap buffer overflow. Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Barry K. Nathan, and Christian Kohlschutter of L3S Research Center for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-0165

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

* **iChat**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0152

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: iChat AIM communications configured for SSL may downgrade to plaintext

  Description: iChat supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for AOL Instant Messenger and Jabber accounts. iChat automatically disables SSL for AOL Instant Messenger accounts when it is unable to connect, and sends subsequent communications in plain text until SSL is manually re-enabled. A remote attacker with the ability to observe network traffic from an affected system may obtain the contents of AOL Instant Messenger conversations. This update addresses the issue by changing the behavior of iChat to always attempt to use SSL, and to use less secure channels only if the "Require SSL" preference is not enabled. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5, as they do not support SSL for iChat accounts. Credit to Chris Adams for reporting this issue.
