# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-061 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in the Microsoft .NET Common Language Runtime Could Allow Remote Code Execution (974378)

Published: October 13, 2009 | Updated: June 22, 2010

**Version:** 1.4

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on a client system if a user views a specially crafted Web page using a Web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs) or Silverlight applications, or if an attacker succeeds in persuading a user to run a specially crafted Microsoft .NET application. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. The vulnerabilities could also allow remote code execution on a server system running IIS, if that server allows processing ASP.NET pages and an attacker succeeds in uploading a specially crafted ASP.NET page to that server and executing it, as could be the case in a Web hosting scenario. Microsoft .NET applications, Silverlight applications, XBAPs and ASP.NET pages that are not malicious are not at risk of being compromised because of this vulnerability.

This security update is rated Critical for all affected editions of the Microsoft .NET Framework on Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista; Microsoft Silverlight 2 when installed on Mac; and Microsoft Silverlight 2 when installed on all releases of Microsoft Windows clients.

This security update is rated Important for all affected editions of the Microsoft .NET Framework on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.

This security update is rated Moderate for Microsoft Silverlight 2 when installed on all releases of Microsoft Windows servers.

For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way in which the Microsoft .NET verifies and enforces the rules of Microsoft .NET verifiable code and by modifying the way in which the Microsoft .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) handles interfaces. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on June 22, 2010?**

This bulletin was updated to remove .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 as an affected component on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 is not a supported component of these operating systems.

**I have a version of Microsoft .NET Framework installed on my system that is not listed in this bulletin. Is my configuration affected by this vulnerability?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle or are not supported. Customers who have an unsupported version of the Microsoft .NET Framework installed on their system are advised to uninstall that version of the Microsoft .NET Framework and to upgrade to a newer version of the Microsoft .NET Framework.

The Microsoft .NET Framework can be uninstalled via the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. For more information about the removal of specific versions of the Microsoft .NET Framework, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320122](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320112), [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824643](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824643), and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 908077](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/908077).

**Why was this bulletin revised on May 11, 2010?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce a detection logic change to fix the issue where the October 13, 2009 security update for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (KB974417) was incorrectly being offered after the forward compatibility update for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB976569) had been installed on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. This is a detection change only that does not affect the files contained in the initial update. Customers who have successfully updated their systems do not need to reinstall this update.

This detection change may cause the KB974417 update to show up as a new update for customers using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). If you do not have auto-approve rules in place, you may have to reapprove the update manually. Not re-approving the update may cause the update to continue to be offered to systems even if the update is not applicable. For more information about this detection change, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 894199](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/894199).

* Corrected the switch information for installing without restarting for the following combinations of Microsoft .NET Framework and Windows operating systems:
  + Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2
* Corrected log file information and values for registry key verification for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (KB953300) and for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 (KB974417) on all affected releases of Windows.

**Why are Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 affected?**

Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 includes Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 1 subcomponents. Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 contains Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 subcomponents. On some operating systems, both Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 may install these vulnerable subcomponents.

**Which Web browsers support XAML browser applications or Silverlight applications?**

Microsoft Internet Explorer supports XBAPs (XAML browser applications) natively. Other Web browsers may not support XBAPs or may require a browser plug-in to be installed to support XBAPs. In order to run Silverlight applications, most Web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, require Microsoft Silverlight to be installed and the corresponding plug-in to be enabled. For more information about Silverlight, see [The Official Site of Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/). Please refer to the documentation of your browser to learn more about how to disable or remove plug-ins.

**How do I upgrade my version of Silverlight?**

The Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature helps makes sure that your Silverlight installation is kept up to date with the latest version of Silverlight, Silverlight functionality, and security features. For more information about the Silverlight auto-update feature, see the [Microsoft Silverlight Updater](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/resources/documentation/updater.aspx). Customers who have disabled the Silverlight auto-update feature can enroll in [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) to obtain the latest version of Silverlight, or download the latest version of Silverlight manually using the download link in the Affected Software table. For information about deploying Silverlight in an enterprise environment, see the [Silverlight Enterprise Deployment Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=119611).

**Why does this security update have different severity levels for different Windows operating systems?**

This update has different severity levels because different mitigations apply to the vulnerability depending on the operating system. One such mitigation is that Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Another mitigation is that by default, ASP.NET is not installed or enabled on Windows server operating systems.

**Does MBSA support detection for this security update on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2?**

MBSA supports detection for this security update on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 as of MBSA version 2.1.1, available as of the General Availability date of these operating systems. For more information, visit [MBSA](https://www.microsoft.com/mbsa).

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow a malicious Microsoft .NET application to obtain a managed pointer to stack memory that is no longer used. The malicious Microsoft .NET application could then use this pointer to modify legitimate values placed at that stack location later, leading to arbitrary unmanaged code execution. Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0090](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0090).

#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.
* In a Web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a Web site and ASP.NET must be installed on that Web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode mitigates this vulnerability only in a Web-based attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 8 disables the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone. This feature of Internet Explorer 8 makes successful exploitation of this vulnerability more difficult by blocking a known technique for bypassing ASLR and DEP protection. Disabling the Microsoft .NET MIME Filter in the Internet zone does not make it impossible to exploit this vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8, but it does make it more difficult for malicious Web sites to reliably exploit it.
* In a Web-browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. Users or accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users or accounts that operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable partially trusted Microsoft .NET applications**

  To disable all Microsoft .NET applications running at partial trust, including XAML browser applications (XBAPs) and Microsoft .NET applications located on the network, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetlockdowncaspol -pp on`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** Some Microsoft .NET applications will not run.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To reset the Microsoft .NET security policies to the defaults, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetcaspol -pp on`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to undo this workaround.
* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones.

  1. **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**.
  3. **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat these steps for **XAML browser applications** and **XPS documents**.
  4. **Security** tab, click **Custom level**, under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, for **Run components not signed with Authenticode**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat these steps for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  5. **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without a prompt. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  1. **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for Microsoft .NET Framework Pointer Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0090

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability in either the context of the currently logged on user, or in the context of the service account associated with an application pool identity.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability results from the manner in which Microsoft .NET verifiable code is verified.

**What is the CLR?**

The Microsoft .NET Framework provides a run-time environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier. For more information about the CLR, see [Common Language Runtime Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ddk909ch%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What is an XBAP?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a Web application and a rich-client application. Like Web applications, XBAPs can be published to a Web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes and no. For the Web browsing attack scenario, running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 mitigates the vulnerability, but for the Web hosting and .NET Application attack scenario, these platforms do not mitigate the vulnerability. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In the Web hosting scenario, an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the service account associated with the application pool identity of the application pool that a Microsoft .NET application is running under. Depending on application pool isolation configuration and permissions granted to the service account, an attacker might be able to take control over other application pools on the Web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system. For more information about application pool identities and configuration, see [Configure Application Pool Identity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc781986%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three scenarios possible for exploitation of this vulnerability: a Web browsing scenario, a Web hosting scenario, and a Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario. These scenarios are described below.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  If a Web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker user could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario**

  An attacker could place a malicious Microsoft .NET Framework application on a network share and convince users on that network to execute this application.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described below: systems that are using the Web browsing scenario, and systems that are using the Web hosting scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting Web sites using a Web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a Web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.

**I have written a Microsoft .NET application. Do I need to recompile it?**

Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability and do not need to be recompiled. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update modifies the way in which the Microsoft .NET Framework verifies and enforces the rules of Microsoft .NET verifiable code.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Microsoft .NET Framework Type Verification Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0091

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow a malicious Microsoft .NET application to bypass a type equality check. The malicious Microsoft .NET application could exploit this vulnerability by casting an object of one type into another type, leading to arbitrary unmanaged code execution. Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability.

  **Note** If you cannot locate the ActiveX control, use the drop-down box to switch from "Add-ons currently being used in Internet Explorer" to "Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer", or from "Currently loaded add-ons" to "All add-ons", and then follow steps 2 and 3. If the ActiveX control is not present in this list you either have not used the ActiveX control before or it is not present on your system.

  **Note** This workaround is intended only for systems on which Silverlight is already installed, and cannot be used proactively on systems where Silverlight is not yet installed.

  For more information on the Internet Explorer Manage Add-ons feature in Windows XP Service Pack 2, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 883256](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/883256).

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications and Web sites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  1. **Tools** menu and then select **Manage Add-ons**.
  2. **Microsoft Silverlight**, click **Enable**, and then click **OK**.
* **Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{DFEAF541-F3E1-4C24-ACAC-99C30715084A}]

  Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications and Web sites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for Microsoft Silverlight and Microsoft .NET Framework CLR Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2497

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability in either the context of the currently logged on user, or in the context of the service account associated with an application pool identity.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability results from the manner in which the Microsoft .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) handles interfaces.

**What is the CLR?**

The Microsoft .NET Framework provides a run-time environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier. For more information about the CLR, see [Common Language Runtime Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ddk909ch%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What is an XBAP?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a Web application and a rich-client application. Like Web applications, XBAPs can be published to a Web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What is Silverlight?**

Microsoft Silverlight is a cross-browser, cross-platform implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework for building media experiences and rich interactive applications for the Web. For more information, see [The Official Site of Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In the Web hosting scenario, an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the service account associated with the application pool identity of the application pool that a Microsoft .NET application is running under. Depending on application pool isolation configuration and permissions granted to the service account, an attacker might be able to take control over other application pools on the Web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system. For more information about application pool identities and configuration, see [Configure Application Pool Identity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc781986%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three scenarios possible for exploitation of this vulnerability: a Web browsing scenario, a Web hosting scenario, and a Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario. These scenarios are described below.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) or Silverlight application that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  If a Web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario**

  An attacker could place a malicious Microsoft .NET Framework application on a network share and convince users on that network to execute this application.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described below: systems that are using the Web browsing scenario, and systems that are using the Web hosting scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting Web sites using a Web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs or Silverlight applications. Therefore, any systems where a Web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes and no. For the Web browsing attack scenario, running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 mitigates the vulnerability, but for the Web hosting and Microsoft .NET application attack scenario, these platforms do not mitigate the vulnerability. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**I have written a Microsoft .NET application or a Silverlight application. Do I need to recompile it?**

Microsoft .NET applications and Silverlight applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability and do not need to be recompiled. Only applications built in a specifically malicious way could exploit this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update modifies the way in which the Microsoft .NET CLR handles interfaces.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-2497](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2497).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Note for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB974417)** When you install this security update, the installer checks whether the product or component being updated has previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the LDR (or QFE) version of the files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the GDR version of the files to your system. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960043](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960043).

For more information about the installer, visit the [MSDN Web site](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa367988%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows XP (all editions)

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |

**Note for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB974417)** When you install this security update, the installer checks whether the product or component being updated has previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the LDR (or QFE) version of the files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the GDR version of the files to your system. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960043](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960043).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

**Note for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 (KB974417)** When you install this security update, the installer checks whether the product or component being updated has previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the LDR (or QFE) version of the files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the GDR version of the files to your system. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960043](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/960043).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)
