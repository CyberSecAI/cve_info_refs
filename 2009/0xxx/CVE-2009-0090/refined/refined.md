{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in how the Microsoft .NET Framework verifies and enforces rules for verifiable code. Specifically, a malicious .NET application can obtain a managed pointer to stack memory that is no longer in use.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper pointer handling",
      "Insufficient verification of managed code"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by creating a malicious Microsoft .NET application that exploits the pointer vulnerability. This can result in the attacker gaining the same user rights as the local user or the service account of ASP.NET. If the user has admin rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web browsing: Attacker hosts a malicious XBAP on a website that the victim visits.",
      "Web hosting: Attacker uploads a malicious ASP.NET page to a vulnerable web server.",
       "Application execution: Attacker convinces a victim to execute a malicious .NET application."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted malicious .NET application and must either convince a user to execute this application or upload it to a vulnerable server. In a web browsing scenario, the attacker has to convince the user to visit a malicious webpage.",
      "affected_components": [
            ".NET Framework 1.0 SP3",
            ".NET Framework 1.1 SP1",
            ".NET Framework 2.0",
