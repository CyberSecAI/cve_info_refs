  "CVE-2009-0901": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to force VariantClear to be called on a VARIANT that has not been correctly initialized. Because of this, the attacker can control what happens when VariantClear is called during handling of an error by supplying a corrupt stream. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. This issue could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to call VariantClear() on a variant that has not been correctly initialized.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized object",
      "Incorrect object instantiation from data stream"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on an affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted Web page with vulnerable component",
      "Opening a malicious file with a vulnerable component."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can control what happens when VariantClear is called by supplying a corrupt stream. Requires the target system to load a vulnerable component or control, often through a web page viewed in Internet Explorer.",
    "additional_details": [
      "An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer.",
      "Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights."
