Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the fMoblog WordPress plugin, version 2.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database Exposure:**  An attacker can leverage the SQL injection to extract sensitive information directly from the database.
- **Data Breach:** The provided exploit example demonstrates how an attacker can retrieve user login credentials (username, password hash, and email address) from the `wp_users` table.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to modify data, add new administrative users, or potentially gain full control of the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET request:** The attack is performed via a crafted HTTP GET request.
- **Vulnerable parameter:** The `id` parameter within the URL is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress website.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to know basic SQL syntax and structure to craft a successful exploit.
- **Knowledge of WordPress schema:**  The attacker benefits from knowing standard WordPress table names such as `wp_users` to retrieve sensitive information.

**Additional Information:**

- The exploit example provided uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to combine results from the injected query with the original query.
- The exploit uses `group_concat` to combine multiple results from the `wp_users` table into a single output field.
- The exploit uses `0x3a` which is the hexadecimal representation of a colon to separate fields.
- The exploit uses `--` to comment out the rest of the query.
-  The identified Google Dork `"Gallery powered by fMoblog"` helps in locating vulnerable sites
