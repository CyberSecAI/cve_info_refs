    {
      "url": "www.zerodayinitiative.com_1f9cf799_20250125_024322.html",
      "text": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within RealPlayer's parsing of IVR files. The process trusts size values present in the file and uses them unsafely in various file I/O and memory allocation operations. A specially crafted file can cause memory overflows to occur leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the player."
    }
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to RealPlayer's unsafe parsing of IVR files. The software trusts size values present in the file, leading to issues during file I/O and memory allocation operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe handling of size values from IVR files",
      "Memory overflow due to unchecked size parameters",
      "Improper file I/O operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the player.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page",
      "Opening a malicious IVR file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious IVR file with manipulated size values. The user must then interact with the crafted content (either by visiting a malicious web page or opening the malicious file).",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in how RealPlayer parses IVR files, specifically in the handling of size values. By providing malicious size values, an attacker can trigger memory overflows leading to arbitrary code execution."
