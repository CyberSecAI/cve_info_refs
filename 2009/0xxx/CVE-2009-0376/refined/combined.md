# Advisory Details

January 21st, 2010
## RealNetworks RealPlayer IVR Format Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-10-009ZDI-CAN-318

| CVE ID | [CVE-2009-0376](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0376) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [RealNetworks](http://www.real.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [RealPlayer](http://www.real.com) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6964']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within RealPlayer's parsing of IVR files. The process trusts size values present in the file and uses them unsafely in various file I/O and memory allocation operations. A specially crafted file can cause memory overflows to occur leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the player. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://service.real.com/realplayer/security/01192010_player/en/> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2008-04-16 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2010-01-21 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
