Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The request handler in JBossWS does not properly validate the resource path when serving WSDL files for custom web service endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper resource path verification.
- Unrestricted access to local XML files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can read arbitrary XML files with the privileges of the JBoss EAP process. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive configuration data, credentials, or other private information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can send crafted requests to retrieve WSDL files.
- The vulnerability is present in the JBossWS component of JBoss EAP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable JBoss EAP server.
- No special privileges are needed by the attacker, they only need network access to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the handling of WSDL files for custom web service endpoints.
- The issue was addressed in JBoss EAP 4.3.0.CP04 and 4.2.0.CP06
- The fix involves correcting the resource path verification within the JBossWS component.
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a moderate security impact.
