## Topic

Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) 4.3 packages that
fix various issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as
JBEAP 4.3.0.CP04.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) is the market-leading
platform for innovative and scalable Java applications. JBoss EAP
integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam
into a complete, simple enterprise solution.

This release of JBoss EAP for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 serves as a
replacement for JBEAP 4.3.0.CP03.

These updated packages include bug fixes and enhancements which are
detailed in the release notes. The link to the release notes is available
in the References section of this errata.

The following security issue is also fixed with this release:

The request handler in JBossWS did not correctly verify the resource path
when serving WSDL files for custom web service endpoints. This allowed
remote attackers to read arbitrary XML files with the permissions of the
EAP process. (CVE-2009-0027)

Warning: before applying this update, please back up the JBoss EAP
"server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, as well as any other customized
configuration files.

All users of JBoss EAP 4.3 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to
upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
