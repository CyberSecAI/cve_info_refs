```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses an insecure method of handling cookies. Specifically, it appears that the application is setting the 'crypt' cookie with a value of '1' and setting the path to root '/'. This is done via javascript:document.cookie which can be easily manipulated.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure cookie handling, potentially leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of user sessions.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially modify or manipulate the 'crypt' cookie value. This could lead to privilege escalation or session hijacking if the application relies on this cookie for authentication or authorization without proper validation or encryption.
- Attack vectors: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting javascript code that sets a malicious cookie value.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to inject javascript code, such as through XSS or other means, to set a malicious cookie.
