Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-0393, as well as the information related to CVE-2009-0392:

**CVE-2009-0393 & CVE-2009-0392**

*   **Vulnerable Product:** Motorola Wimax modem CPEi300
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** The `sysconf.cgi` script does not properly validate user-supplied input in the `page` parameter, allowing directory traversal.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `sysconf.cgi` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `page` parameter, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Directory Traversal: Improper input validation allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Insufficient sanitization of input leads to execution of malicious scripts in the context of the user's browser.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Directory Traversal:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the system, including sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **XSS:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerabilities are accessible via HTTP requests to the `sysconf.cgi` script.
    *   The `page` parameter of the `sysconf.cgi` script is the injection point for both directory traversal and XSS attacks.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.
    *   The user must be logged in to the device for the exploit to work.

**Exploit Examples:**

*   **Directory Traversal:**
    ```
    http://Hostname/cgi-bin/sysconf.cgi?page=../../../etc/passwd&action=request&sid=AeoFSFoI4lDs
    ```
*   **XSS:**
    ```
    http://Hostname/cgi-bin/sysconf.cgi?page="><script>alert(1);</script>"&action=request&sid=AeoFSFoI4lDs
    ```

**Additional Notes**
* This exploit requires user to be logged in
