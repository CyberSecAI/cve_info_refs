```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application includes a file based on user-controlled input via the MAX_type GET parameter without proper sanitization or validation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to the lack of input sanitization on the MAX_type parameter, allowing directory traversal.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by injecting directory traversal sequences and a null byte into the MAX_type parameter.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script with a crafted MAX_type parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs no authentication.
