{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation of the 'preview' parameter in the index.php file. The application uses `file_exists()` to check the existence of a config.php file within a directory specified by the preview parameter, which can be bypassed using directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the 'preview' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files from the server by providing a path to the file via directory traversal. This can lead to information disclosure, such as configuration files, source code, or even system files like /etc/passwd.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request via the `preview` parameter in the index.php file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication or local access is needed."
