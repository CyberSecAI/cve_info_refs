{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the handling of the `LIST` command within WFTPSRV.exe (version 2.3.0). Specifically, the server fails to properly handle a long string following `LIST *`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A buffer overflow vulnerability allows for arbitrary memory overwrite.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary memory overwrite, leading to control of the instruction pointer (EIP) and potentially arbitrary code execution. In the provided exploit, successful exploitation results in a command shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted `LIST` command containing a long string after the asterisk (`*`).",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to authenticate to the FTP server first, and then send the specially crafted `LIST` command."
