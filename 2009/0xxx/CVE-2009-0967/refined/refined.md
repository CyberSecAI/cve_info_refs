{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of the SMNT command, which allows for a denial of service attack by sending a large number of these commands.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and resource management when handling the SMNT command. The server does not properly handle a large influx of SMNT commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of exploitation is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The server becomes saturated, stops responding and becomes unavailable to legitimate users.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, specifically through the FTP protocol. The attacker sends a large number of SMNT commands after authenticating.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the FTP server, authenticate with a valid username and password, and then send crafted FTP commands. The exploit script shows that a basic FTP client implementation is sufficient."
