{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a blind SQL injection in the `comentar.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection. The vulnerability exists because the `id` parameter in `comentar.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data, in this case, the password of a user, from the database by using blind SQL injection techniques.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `comentar.php` file via an HTTP GET request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Pardal CMS instance. They need knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and the database structure."
