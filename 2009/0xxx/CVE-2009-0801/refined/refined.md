{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Transparent proxy servers make connection decisions based on HTTP header values instead of source and destination IP addresses. This allows an attacker to forge HTTP host-header (or other HTTP headers) via active content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect reliance on HTTP headers for connection decisions",
      "Lack of proper validation of HTTP Host header"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can make connections to any website or resource that the proxy can connect to, potentially including internal resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious active content (Java, Flash, Silverlight, etc.) embedded in a webpage",
       "Forged HTTP headers via active content"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to visit a web page with malicious active content or be able to load the active content in an otherwise trusted site. The attacker needs to be able to forge HTTP headers."
