SUMMARY
=======
[CVE-2009-0846]
An ASN.1 decoder can free an uninitialized pointer when decoding an
invalid encoding. This can cause a Kerberos application to crash, or,
under theoretically possible but unlikely circumstances, execute
arbitrary malicious code. No exploit is known to exist that would
cause arbitrary code execution.
This is an implementation vulnerability in MIT krb5, and is not a
vulnerability in the Kerberos protocol.
IMPACT
======
[CVE-2009-0846] An unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a
Kerberos application, including the Kerberos administration daemon
(kadmind) or the KDC to crash, and possibly to execute arbitrary code.
Compromise of the KDC or kadmind can compromise the Kerberos key
database and host security on the KDC host. (The KDC and kadmind
typically run as root.) We believe this scenario is highly unlikely,
given the details of the vulnerability.
Third-party applications using MIT krb5 may also be vulnerable.
MITIGATING FACTORS
==================
While it is theoretically possible for an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by exploiting this vulnerability, it is believed to be
more difficult than exploiting other sorts of memory management flaws
such as double-free or heap buffer overflow events. Also, in order to
exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute code, an attacker must
ensure that the uninitialized pointer points to valid address space,
otherwise a null-dereference crash will typically occur.
Some operating systems have hardened malloc implementations that are
not susceptible to this problem. These operating systems are still
vulnerable to a denial of service if the uninitialized pointer points
to invalid address space.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* All MIT krb5 releases
\* Third-party software using the krb5 library from MIT krb5 releases
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.7 and krb5-1.6.4 releases will contain fixes for
this vulnerability.

DETAILS
=======
The asn1\_decode\_generaltime() function, which decodes DER encodings of
the ASN.1 type "GeneralizedTime", can free an uninitialized pointer.
This can cause a Kerberos application to crash, or, under
theoretically possible but unlikely circumstances, execute arbitrary
malicious code. No exploit is known to exist that would cause
arbitrary code execution.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-03-19 02:48:19 UTC  ``` An ASN.1 decoder can free an uninitialized pointer when decoding an invalid encoding.  This can cause a Kerberos application to crash, or, under theoretically possible but unlikely circumstances, execute arbitrary malicious code.  No exploit is known to exist that would cause arbitrary code execution.  This is an implementation vulnerability in MIT krb5, and is not a vulnerability in the Kerberos protocol.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c2)  Vincent Danen    2009-03-19 02:57:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 335794](attachment.cgi?id=335794&action=diff "upstream patch to fix MITKRB5-SA-2009-002 issue (CVE-2009-0846)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=335794&action=edit "upstream patch to fix MITKRB5-SA-2009-002 issue (CVE-2009-0846)") upstream patch to fix MITKRB5-SA-2009-002 issue ([CVE-2009-0846](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0846))   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-24 11:46:44 UTC  ``` This flaw can easily allow an attacker to crash affected application.  Code execution depends on ability to exploit free() called on uninitialized pointer.  glibc on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and later provides hardened malloc/free implementations, greatly mitigating possibility of exploitation of this flaw.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3 do not offer such hardening, resulting in higher impact rating for those versions.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-07 18:22:20 UTC  ``` Public now via:   <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2009-002.txt>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-07 18:47:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0408 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0408.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-07 18:47:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:0409 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0409.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-07 18:48:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:0410 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0410.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=491036#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-07 23:23:11 UTC  ``` krb5-1.6.3-16.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Service Console package krb5 update

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to
provide strong authentication for client/server applications by
using secret-key cryptography.
An input validation flaw in the asn1\_decode\_generaltime function in
MIT Kerberos 5 before 1.6.4 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors
involving an invalid DER encoding that triggers a free of an
uninitialized pointer.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash a network service
using the MIT Kerberos library, such as kadmind or krb5kdc, by
causing it to dereference or free an uninitialized pointer or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the service.
NOTE: ESX by default is unaffected by this issue, the daemons
kadmind and krb5kdc are not installed in ESX.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0846 to this issue.
In addition the ESX 4.0 Service Console krb5 package was also
updated for CVE-2009-0845, and CVE-2009-0844 and RHBA-2009-0135.
MIT Kerberos versions 5 1.5 through 1.6.3 might allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service by using invalid
ContextFlags data in the reqFlags field in a negTokenInit token.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0845 to this issue.
MIT Kerberos 5 before version 1.6.4 might allow remote attackers to
cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code by
using vectors involving an invalid DER encoding that triggers a
free of an uninitialized pointer.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0846 to this issue.
For ESX 4.0, 3.5, 3.0.3 the Service Console package pam\_krb5 has
also been upgraded. For details on the non-security issues that
this upgrade addresses, refer to the respective KB article listed
in section 4 below.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available.

# MIT Kerberos 5: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200904-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities in MIT Kerberos 5 might allow remote
unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3-r6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3-r6** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol. kadmind is the MIT Kerberos 5 administration daemon,
KDC is the Key Distribution Center.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in MIT Kerberos 5:

* A free() call on an uninitialized pointer in the ASN.1 decoder
  when decoding an invalid encoding (CVE-2009-0846).
* A buffer
  overread in the SPNEGO GSS-API application, reported by Apple Product
  Security (CVE-2009-0844).
* A NULL pointer dereference in the
  SPNEGO GSS-API application, reported by Richard Evans
  (CVE-2009-0845).
* An incorrect length check inside an ASN.1
  decoder leading to spurious malloc() failures (CVE-2009-0847).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit the first vulnerability
to cause a Denial of Service or, in unlikely circumstances, execute
arbitrary code on the host running krb5kdc or kadmind with root
privileges and compromise the Kerberos key database. Exploitation of
the other vulnerabilities might lead to a Denial of Service in kadmind,
krb5kdc, or other daemons performing authorization against Kerberos
that utilize GSS-API or an information disclosure.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.6.3-r6"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Packages

* [krb5](/security/cves?package=krb5) -

## Details

Multiple flaws were discovered in the Kerberos GSS-API and ASN.1 routines

that did not correctly handle certain requests. An unauthenticated remote

attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash services using

the Kerberos library, leading to a denial of service.

RHSA-2009:0410 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-04-07
Updated:
2009-04-07
# RHSA-2009:0410 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: krb5 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated krb5 packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

An input validation flaw was found in the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation
One) decoder used by MIT Kerberos. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a network service using the MIT Kerberos library, such as kadmind or
krb5kdc, by causing it to dereference or free an uninitialized pointer or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the service. (CVE-2009-0846)

All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue. All running services using the MIT
Kerberos libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2009:0409 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: krb5 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0409)

## Topic

Updated krb5 packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Kerberos is a network authentication system which allows clients and
servers to authenticate to each other using symmetric encryption and a
trusted third party, the Key Distribution Center (KDC).

An input validation flaw was found in the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation
One) decoder used by MIT Kerberos. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a network service using the MIT Kerberos library, such as kadmind or
krb5kdc, by causing it to dereference or free an uninitialized pointer.
(CVE-2009-0846)

All krb5 users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue. All running services using the MIT
Kerberos libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R13/R13.1, R14/R14.1, R15 | Low | Kerberos is installed, but not enabled or supported by CMS. This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
