Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0168:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `lpadmin(1M)` and `ppdmgr(1M)` utilities of the Solaris operating system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerabilities are described as "security vulnerabilities" and "may lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition."  The exact nature of the vulnerabilities is not specified in the provided text, but it's likely related to improper handling of input or state, which can be triggered through specific usage patterns.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This would make the affected systems or services unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vectors are not explicitly specified. Since `lpadmin` and `ppdmgr` are command-line utilities, the attack vector likely involves providing specific inputs or arguments to these utilities. The advisory notes that local and network access should be restricted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would require the ability to execute commands on the system. This could be achieved through local access or potentially through network access if the utilities are exposed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Avaya advisory mentions that a patch (139390-01) is available to address the vulnerability on Avaya CMS R15 systems.
- The Avaya advisory also suggests restricting access to vulnerable systems using physical security, firewalls, ACLs, and VPNs as a temporary mitigation until a patch is applied.
-  The advisory references Sun Alert Notification 249306 and the CVE entries for additional information, which may contain more specific technical details of the vulnerability.
