  "cveId": "CVE-2009-0723",
  "description": "Multiple integer overflows in LittleCMS (aka lcms or liblcms) before 1.18beta2, as used in Firefox 3.1beta, OpenJDK, and GIMP, allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted image file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Integer overflows in LittleCMS (lcms or liblcms) when handling crafted image files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Missing bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause an application using LittleCMS to crash, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted image file",
      "Remote exploitation by enticing a user or automated system to open the file"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious image file with specific ICC profile data."
