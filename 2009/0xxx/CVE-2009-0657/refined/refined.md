Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities discussed in the context of face authentication systems, specifically those by Lenovo, Asus, and Toshiba:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core vulnerability lies in the reliance of face recognition systems on digital image processing, making them susceptible to manipulation. The systems treat input as digital information without sufficient verification if the image is from a live source or a manipulated one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Bypass via Fake Faces:** The systems can be bypassed by using a photograph or video of an authorized user, as opposed to a live facial scan.
2.  **Insufficient Liveness Detection:** The systems lack robust mechanisms to distinguish between a live person and a static image or recording.
3.  **Vulnerability to Image Processing:** The systems operate on digital images that are pre-processed. This makes them vulnerable to attacks that manipulate these images by altering lighting, viewpoint, and other features.
4. **Low Resolution Camera Limitations:** The low resolution of the cameras used in laptops of the three vendors can be exploited by an attacker.
5. **Varied Lighting Condition Issues:** The algorithms used in these systems are not robust to changes in lighting.
6. **Balancing FAR and FRR:** The need to balance False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) makes the systems less secure than other biometric methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's computer and account.
*   **Data Breach:** Once access is gained, the attacker can access sensitive data, modify settings, and potentially install malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Capture:** Obtaining photos or videos of authorized users through various methods such as social media, chat applications, or direct capture.
*   **Image Manipulation:** Editing images to adjust for lighting, viewpoint, and other characteristics to match the enrolled facial data.
*   **"Fake Face Bruteforce":** Using multiple edited images to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Target's Image:** The attacker needs access to a digital photo or video of the target user.
*   **Basic Image Editing Skills:** The attacker needs the ability to use image editing software to manipulate images.
*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target's device to perform the bypass.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The research highlights that the face recognition systems of Lenovo, Asus, and Toshiba do not meet the security requirements expected of an authentication system.
*   The study compares face recognition to other biometric methods, pointing out that face recognition has a lower security profile.
* The content provides specific details on the vulnerabilities found in each of the three vendor's implementations and how to bypass them:
    *  **Lenovo Veriface III:** Easiest to bypass, plain images are sufficient.
    *  **Asus SmartLogon:** Harder to bypass, but manipulating the viewpoint can succeed.
    *  **Toshiba Face Recognition:** Most difficult, but still vulnerable to "brute-force" using modified images, specially altered lighting.
*   The paper provides a "Bypass Model" illustrating the methodology of using fake faces.

In conclusion, the content reveals vulnerabilities in face authentication systems related to image processing and lack of liveness detection, allowing for bypass using manipulated images.
