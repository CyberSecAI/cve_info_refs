The provided content includes information about IBM WebSphere Application Server V6.1 for z/OS, specifically regarding APAR PK81212 which addresses multiple defects. Among the list of defects addressed by PK81212, there are two specific vulnerabilities that are security related. These are:

**1. PK76720: Cross-site scripting security vulnerabilities exist in the WebSphere sample applications.**
   - **Weakness:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
   - **Impact:** Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting the vulnerability requires an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the WebSphere sample application.
    - **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to find an input field or a feature in the application that does not properly sanitize input and allows script injection

**2. PK77505: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in administrative console.**
    - **Weakness:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    - **Impact:** Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the administrative console, potentially leading to administrative privilege escalation and configuration changes
    - **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting the vulnerability requires an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the WebSphere administration console.
    - **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to find an input field or a feature in the console that does not properly sanitize input and allows script injection.

**3. PK81387: Possible application source file exposure**
  - **Weakness**: Possible application source file exposure
  - **Impact**: Exposure of source files can reveal sensitive information.
  - **Attack Vector**: The exact mechanism of the file exposure is not explicitly stated.
  - **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to access the server through means not described in the document

The other issues addressed by the APAR include memory leaks, performance problems, configuration issues, and other functional defects, and are not relevant to CVE-2009-0856.

The document does not describe the vulnerabilities in depth, but it does confirm their existence and that a fix was made available via APAR PK81212, targeted for inclusion in Fix Pack 6.1.0.23 of WebSphere Application Server V6.1.0 for z/OS.
