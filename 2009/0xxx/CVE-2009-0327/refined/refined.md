Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0327:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a direct reference to CVE-2009-0327, which is described as a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Free Bible Search PHP Script." This confirms the relevance of the content to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `readbible.php` script. Specifically, the `version` parameter is not being validated or escaped before being used in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the direct use of user-supplied input in a SQL query without any validation or sanitization.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials or other confidential information.
*   **Data Modification:** It might be possible to modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting specific SQL queries, an attacker might be able to cause the database server to become unresponsive or crash.
*   **Complete compromise:** In the worst case scenario it might be possible to execute arbitrary code on the database server by leveraging advanced SQL Injection techniques.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `readbible.php` script, where the attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `version` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable script.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
*   **Web Application knowledge:** The attacker must be able to interact with the web application and modify parameters in HTTP requests.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

The exploit is demonstrated using the following example:

`http://localhost/[path]/readbible.php?version=kjv%20union%20select%20@@version--`

This URL shows how to inject the SQL command `select @@version` into the query, which will return the database server's version information. The `kjv union` part of the payload shows the legitimate data being appended to the malicious SQL command with `union`.

The exploit also demonstrates a public instance of the vulnerable script hosted on `http://www.lordblessthee.com/bible/readbible.php?version=kjv%20union%20select%20@@version--` .

This detailed breakdown gives a comprehensive understanding of how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0327.
