How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : mplayer
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2009-0385 CVE-2008-4866 CVE-2008-5616
Debian Bug     : 508803

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mplayer, a movie player
for Unix-like systems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0385

It was discovered that watching a malformed 4X movie file could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-4866

It was discovered that multiple buffer overflows could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-5616

It was discovered that watching a malformed TwinVQ file could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0~rc1-12etch7.

For the stable distribution (lenny), mplayer links against
ffmpeg-debian.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), mplayer links against ffmpeg-debian.

We recommend that you upgrade your mplayer packages.

Hash: SHA1
Advisory: FFmpeg Type Conversion Vulnerability
Advisory ID: TKADV2009-004
Revision: 1.2
Release Date: 2009/01/28
Last Modified: 2009/02/15
Date Reported: 2009/01/25
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: FFmpeg SVN trunk < revision 16846
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0385
Patch development time: > 1 day (exactly 2h)
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
FFmpeg contains a type conversion vulnerability while parsing malformed 4X
movie files. The vulnerability may be exploited by a (remote) attacker to
execute arbitrary code in the context of FFmpeg or an application using
the FFmpeg library.
FFmpeg is used by a lot of popular software projects like VLC media player
[1], Mplayer [2], Perian [3] and Xine [4].
Note: A similar issue also affects xine-lib < version 1.1.16.2 (see [7]).
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file: libavformat/4xm.c
[..]
93 static int fourxm\_read\_header(AVFormatContext \*s,
94 AVFormatParameters \*ap)
95 {
..
103 [8] int current\_track = -1;
..
106 [9] fourxm->track\_count = 0;
107 [10] fourxm->tracks = NULL;
..
160 } else if (fourcc\_tag == strk\_TAG) {
161 /\* check that there is enough data \*/
162 if (size != strk\_SIZE) {
163 av\_free(header);
164 return AVERROR\_INVALIDDATA;
165 }
166 [1] current\_track = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 8]);
167 [2] if (current\_track + 1 > fourxm->track\_count) {
168 fourxm->track\_count = current\_track + 1;
169 if((unsigned)fourxm->track\_count >= UINT\_MAX /
sizeof(AudioTrack))
170 return -1;
171 [3] fourxm->tracks = av\_realloc(fourxm->tracks,
172 fourxm->track\_count \* sizeof(AudioTrack));
173 if (!fourxm->tracks) {
174 av\_free(header);
175 return AVERROR(ENOMEM);
176 }
177 }
178 [4] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].adpcm = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 12]);
179 [5] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].channels = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 36]);
180 [6] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].sample\_rate = AV\_RL32(&header[i+40]);
181 [7] fourxm->tracks[current\_track].bits = AV\_RL32(&header[i + 44]);
[..]
[1] The signed int variable "current\_track" (see [8]) is filled with user
supplied data from the media file
[2] This statement checks if the user controlled value of "current\_track"
is greater than "fourxm->track\_count". The variable "fourxm-
>track\_count" is initialized with 0 (see [9]). By supplying a value >=
0x80000000 for "current\_track" it is possible to cause a change in sign
that results in "current\_track" being negative. If "current\_track" is
negative, the if statement will always return false and the buffer
allocation in [3] will never be reached.
[4] As "fourxm->tracks" is initialized with NULL (see [10]) and line 171 is
never reached this leads to an exploitable NULL pointer dereference. It
is possible to write 4 bytes of user controlled data to the memory
location "NULL + current\_track". As the value of "current\_track" is
also controlled by the user it is possible to write 4 bytes of
arbitrary data at a wide range of memory addresses.
[5] See [4]
[6] See [4]
[7] See [4]
A malicious party may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code by
overwriting a sensitive memory location (such as a GOT/IAT entry, a return
address, buffer length or boolean variable).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-734-1: FFmpeg vulnerabilities

16 March 2009

FFmpeg vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)

## Packages

* [ffmpeg](/security/cves?package=ffmpeg) -
* [ffmpeg-debian](/security/cves?package=ffmpeg-debian) -

## Details

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain malformed

Ogg Media (OGM) files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Ogg

Media file, an attacker could cause the application using FFmpeg to crash,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4610](/security/CVE-2008-4610))

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain parameters

when creating DTS streams. If a user were tricked into processing certain

commands, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application

crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4866](/security/CVE-2008-4866))

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain malformed

DTS Coherent Acoustics (DCA) files. If a user were tricked into opening a

crafted DCA file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-4867](/security/CVE-2008-4867))

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain malformed 4X

movie (4xm) files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted 4xm file,

an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0385](/security/CVE-2009-0385))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:13:59 UTC  ``` The current tcl-tk-8.33.ebuild is slightly broken. It does not install the private headers that are needed for tcl-tk apps to compile against.  For example this is why tcl scripting is broken in the vim-6.0 ebuild. Also separate ebuilds for tcl and tk would be nice as it makes it easy to make ebuilds with tcl dependencies with out pulling in X at the same time.   I am submitting ebuilds in that correct this bug. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# FFmpeg: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-33**

Multiple vulnerabilities in FFmpeg may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-video/ffmpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.4.9\_p20090201** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.4.9\_p20090201** |

| Package | **media-plugins/gst-plugins-ffmpeg** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.5** |

| Package | **media-video/mplayer** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0\_rc2\_p28450** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0\_rc2\_p28450** |

### Background

FFmpeg is a complete solution to record, convert and stream audio and
video. gst-plugins-ffmpeg is a FFmpeg based gstreamer plugin which
includes a vulnerable copy of FFmpeg code. Mplayer is a multimedia
player which also includes a vulnerable copy of the code.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in FFmpeg:

* astrange
  reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the str\_read\_packet() in
  libavformat/psxstr.c when processing .str files (CVE-2008-3162).
* Multiple buffer overflows in libavformat/utils.c
  (CVE-2008-4866).
* A buffer overflow in libavcodec/dca.c
  (CVE-2008-4867).
* An unspecified vulnerability in the
  avcodec\_close() function in libavcodec/utils.c (CVE-2008-4868).
* Unspecified memory leaks (CVE-2008-4869).
* Tobias Klein
  repoerted a NULL pointer dereference due to an integer signedness error
  in the fourxm\_read\_header() function in libavformat/4xm.c
  (CVE-2009-0385).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FFmpeg users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/ffmpeg-0.4.9_p20090201"
```

All gst-plugins-ffmpeg users should upgrade to the latest version:
