The provided content discusses multiple security vulnerabilities and their fixes in RavenNuke(tm). While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2009-0679, it provides details about several issues that were addressed in a security update. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure and Remote Detection of Local Files in `captcha.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `captcha.php` script was revealing the full server path, potentially allowing attackers to gain information about the system's configuration and locate other files.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially use the disclosed path information to plan more targeted attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP requests to `captcha.php`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** No special capabilities were required, only knowledge of the vulnerable script.
*   **SQL Injection in "Resend\_Email" module:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The "Resend\_Email" module was susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
    *  **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Through the Resend_Email module.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to craft malicious SQL queries.
*   **Remote PHP Code Execution in `avatarlist.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `avatarlist.php` file had a vulnerability that allowed for remote code execution.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
    *  **Attack Vector:** HTTP requests to `avatarlist.php`.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to craft malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Remote PHP Code Execution in "Your Account" module:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The "Your Account" module contained a remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Through the "Your Account" module.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious requests.
*   **XSS Vulnerability in "Your\_Account":**
     *   **Root Cause:** The "Your Account" module was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
     *   **Weaknesses:**  XSS vulnerability.
     *   **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially stealing user cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the site.
     *  **Attack Vector:**  Through the "Your Account" module.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to inject malicious scripts.

*   **Additional Form validation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient form validation.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Insufficient form validation.
    *  **Impact:** Could be exploited to cause issues.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating form inputs.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to craft malicious form inputs.

**Fixes:**

The forum post indicates that the following actions are required to resolve the security issues:

*   Replace `images/captcha.php`
*   Replace the entire `modules/Resend_Email` directory
*   Replace `admin.php`
*   Replace the entire `modules/Your_Account` directory

The post recommends backing up old files and replacing them with the updated versions.
