How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# 3.2, 3.0.6, 2.22.6, and 3.3.1 Security Advisory

Monday, Feb 2nd, 2009
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* It was possible for users to upload a malicious attachment to
  that would run in the context of Bugzilla's domain (thus
  circumventing cross-site request protections in browsers).

* Bug updating was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery.
  Note that this issue was only fixed for 3.2.1 and 3.3.2 even though
  all versions of Bugzilla are affected (see below for an explanation).

* Keywords, unused flag types, and saved searches could be deleted via
  cross-site request forgery. Also, a user's preferences could be
  changed via cross-site request forgery.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Abuse of Functionality (Attachments)
Affected:    Every version before 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, or 3.3.2
Fixed In:    2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, 3.3.2
Description: Bugzilla users can upload HTML or JavaScript attachments
             that are then viewed by other users in their web browsers.
             A malicious user could trick another Bugzilla user into
             viewing a malicious attachment that could then operate
             as that user. Since Bugzilla would view attachments
             using the same domain name as the rest of the application,
             such malicious attachments could access the cookies of
             the user and perform other activities usually restricted
             by the cross-site request protections of web browsers.

             Bugzilla now provides a two-fold solution to this problem:

             Bugzilla 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, and 3.3.2 now prevent
             users from viewing attachments in their browsers, by
             default. There is a new parameter named
             "allow_attachment_display" that administrators can enable
             to override this protection.

             Once this parameter is turned on, Bugzilla 3.0.7, 3.2.1,
             and 3.3.2 allow administrators to specify that attachments
             should be viewed using a different domain. This increases
             safety for the end user by enabling the browser's
             cross-domain request protections.

             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=472206

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    Every version before 3.2.1 or 3.3.2
Fixed In:    3.2.1, 3.3.2
Description: Bug updating was vulnerable to a cross-site request
             forgery, because it did not validate that calls to
             process_bug.cgi actually came from Bugzilla.

             Bugzilla now generates a token that is validated when
             process_bug.cgi is called. This may break automated
             scripts that call process_bug.cgi directly, unless they
             first load show_bug.cgi to get a valid token.

             Unfortunately, a fix for this issue was only possible for
             3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Fixing it on earlier branches would have
             broken Bugzilla's mid-air collision functionality.

             It should be noted that this issue actually was not a
             secret--it has been public knowledge for quite some time.
             It is only included in this security advisory to note that
             a fix is now available.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26257

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    All Versions (for keywords and user preferences), 2.17 and higher (for flags), 3.0 and higher (for saved searches)
Fixed In:    2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, 3.3.2
Description: When deleting saved searches, keywords, or unused
             (never set on any bug or attachment) flags, or when a user
             updated their preferences, Bugzilla did not properly
             validate that the request came from Bugzilla. So, it was
             possible to trick a user into click on a link that would
             perform these actions without their consent.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=466748#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

I added this to [bug 466692](/show_bug.cgi?id=466692 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] keywords and unused flag types can be deleted by bypassing the token check"), as at the time it seemed yet another instance of the same thing (missing token check / user confirmation for a privileged action), but it seems the cause is in fact rather different.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Find a shared query from the list on your user preferences.
2. Copy-paste the "Run" link
3. edit this to change remaction=run to remaction=forget, and to remove the sharer\_id=....
4. Trick the user who created the query into loading this url
Steps 1 and 2 can be skipped, and this attack used on non-shared queries if you can predict the name of them. For example, users may have a legacy query named "My bugs" that can be deleted with:
https://[munged-to-prevent-accidents]/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=forget&namedcmd=My%20bugs

[patch, v1](attachment.cgi?id=355622&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=355622&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=466748&attachment=355622)

We reuse the functions in Token.pm implemented in [bug 26257](/show_bug.cgi?id=26257 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should prevent malicious webpages from making bugzilla users submit changes to bugs."). To create the hash, I use both the query ID and name, because the query ID is unique and impossible to know. Also, if a user deletes and re-creates a saved search with the same name, the query ID will change, making the temptation to forge the correct hash to abuse the user even smaller.Assignee: query-and-buglist → LpSolitStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

No, the query\_id is predictable given enough time, since it's just a number. You'd have to also hash in something like the user's login token.

This is a weak reason to deny review. Its purpose is to randomize the hash a bit more. I even hesitated to include it at all. In case you forgot, the token generator already uses the site secret + the current time in the token. It's not like only the query ID is passed to build it.

Sure, you still can't generate a token unless you have the site-wide secret, but the way you've done it, the token will always be the same for any given saved search, which I'm not very comfortable with. If the attacker gets the token in any way, then it's valid forever.

| [Comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=466748#c10)• 16 years ago |

No, the token is valid only once, because it takes the search name + the search ID (which is an auto-increment, so unique).

| --- | --- | --- |

|  | |

To be clear: if the attacker manages to make you click the URL with the given token, and makes you delete your saved search, the token won't be usable anymore, because if the user recreates his saved search with the same name, the ID will be different and so the token would be invalid.
We are in the same situation about process\_bug.cgi. As long as a bug didn't change, delta\_ts will remain the same and the token would still be the same till the bug is edited.
And don't forget that the lifetime of a token is 3 days, not "forever".

True. I would have preferred we add the user's logincookie to the hash.
> And don't forget that the lifetime of a token is 3 days, not "forever".
No, these tokens last forever. They don't have a lifetime--this isn't a session token.

They have a lifetime (it's included in the token)! I wrote the code, see [bug 26257](/show_bug.cgi?id=26257 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should prevent malicious webpages from making bugzilla users submit changes to bugs.").

If it's safer to have the user's logincookie in the token, then this should be part of issue\_hash\_token()'s internals, i.e. part of the patch being in [bug 26257](/show_bug.cgi?id=26257 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should prevent malicious webpages from making bugzilla users submit changes to bugs."). Note that as long as a user doesn't log out, the cookie stored in logincookies remains unchanged, so the benefit of using it may not be that large (at least for users like me who don't log out very often, only once a day). Also, another reason to not use it is to keep things simple and fast. Having to query the DB for each page load to get the logincookie may slow down Bugzilla (and may be tricky on pages using the shadow DB if the shadow DB is a bit behind and the logincookie not yet replicated, as templates are generating the token on the fly).

Oh, right, I forgot that tokens had the current time hashed into them. Okay, I'll re-look at the patch, then, when I have some time.

LookupNamedQuery is called at least once in boolean context, which I'm pretty sure is an array context. In that case, this will always be true, because an array of (undef, undef) is a scalar of 2, which is true.
Otherwise this looks fine.

Attached patch

[patch for 3.2 + tip, v2](attachment.cgi?id=358758&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=358758&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=466748&attachment=358758)

I just found that the filtering was wrong. It must be FILTER url\_quote, not FILTER html. I also fixed a link in user-error.html.tmpl if the query already exists. The token wasn't generated by the error message, and so you would trigger the confirmaton page if you were trying to delete the saved search from here.
Tested again, and still works fine.

patch for 3.2 + tip, v2
Looks good to me. I assume you tested it thoroughly, as you always do. :-)

I'll check later today if it needs backports or not, or if the same patch applies cleanly and works correctly on branches.Flags: approval?

This patch works fine as is on 3.2. But I need to backport it to 3.0, or more exactly, to add required Token::\* methods as [bug 26257](/show_bug.cgi?id=26257 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should prevent malicious webpages from making bugzilla users submit changes to bugs.") won't land on 3.0. Bugzilla 2.22.6 doesn't need a backport as shared searches exist only since Bugzilla 3.0, see [bug 69000](/show_bug.cgi?id=69000 "RESOLVED FIXED - Permit a stored query to be marked \"shared\" and accessible by other users"), and so attackers cannot guess user's query names.Flags: approval3.2?Summary: Shared/saved searches can be deleted without user confirmation using predictable URL → [SECURITY] Shared/saved searches can be deleted without user confirmation using predictable URL

patch for 3.0, v1
Looks good and works.
"Are you sure you want to commit these changes?" is a bit confusing when it's just a saved-search deletion, but I'm not too worried about that.
