Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0572:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `_FNROOTPATH` variable in multiple PHP files within the Flatnux application. This allows an attacker to manipulate the include path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the `_FNROOTPATH` variable, which is used to construct file paths in `require_once` and `include` statements, is directly controllable by the user without any input validation. This makes it possible to include remote files.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-supplied `_FNROOTPATH` parameter, allowing arbitrary file paths (including remote URLs) to be used in include statements.
- **Use of `include` and `require_once`:** The use of PHP functions like `include` and `require_once` with user-controlled paths makes the application vulnerable to RFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include malicious code from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
- **Full Server Compromise:** Successful RFI can lead to complete control of the server, allowing the attacker to access data, modify files, and potentially use the compromised server for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameters:** The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `_FNROOTPATH` parameter in the URL of several PHP files, such as `index.php` and `filemanager.php`.
- **Direct File Access:** By manipulating `_FNROOTPATH` an attacker can bypass intended file inclusion and force the application to load arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Flatnux installation.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP GET requests to include malicious remote files.
- **No Authentication Required:** The exploit does not require any prior authentication, making it accessible to any remote attacker.
