Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0740:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection vulnerability in the `login.php` file of BlueBird Pre-Release. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the unsanitized use of the `$username` and `$passwd` variables within the SQL query:
  ```php
  $sql = "SELECT * FROM bluebird_users WHERE username='$username' && password='$passwd' ";
  ```
This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by injecting SQL code that always returns a valid result. In this specific case, using `' or '1=1` in either the username or password field will cause the SQL query to always evaluate to true, granting the attacker unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `login.php` file, with the SQL injection payload in the `username` or `passwd` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `login.php` file, typically by accessing the login form through a web browser or other HTTP client.
- No special privileges on the system or network are required.
