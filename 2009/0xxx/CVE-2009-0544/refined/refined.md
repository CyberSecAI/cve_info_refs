Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the PyCrypto ARC2 module. This occurs when processing a large ARC2 key length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:**  The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of the ARC2 key length within the PyCrypto library. Insufficient bounds checking when allocating memory for the key leads to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could trigger the vulnerability to crash the application, causing a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** It's also possible for an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution, potentially taking full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by crafting a malicious ARC2 stream with a large key length.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker could entice a user or an automated system to decrypt a specially crafted ARC2 stream, triggering the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted ARC2 encrypted stream with an oversized key. This could involve intercepting data streams, providing a malicious file for decryption, or otherwise injecting malformed ARC2 data.
- No specific user privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Mike Wiacek of the Google Security Team.
- The affected version of PyCrypto is 2.0.1 and earlier.
- Patches are available in the pycrypto git repository.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 2.0.1-r8 of the Gentoo package `dev-python/pycrypto`.
- The vulnerability was addressed in a SUSE security update.
