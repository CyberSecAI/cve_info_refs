Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `clanek` parameter of the `index.php` file within Blue Eye CMS. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a **Blind SQL Injection** flaw. The application does not directly display the results of the injected SQL query, making it a blind SQL injection.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database. In this specific case, the provided exploit code aims to extract the admin user's password hash from the `blueeye_users` table.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file, specifically exploiting the `clanek` parameter.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Blue Eye CMS instance. They do not require any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The provided PHP exploit script demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited. It does the following:
1. Takes hostname, path and username as input.
2. Constructs a series of SQL injection queries that use a `SUBSTRING` and `ASCII` comparison to extract each character of the admin password hash.
3. It sends these requests to the target application by crafting a GET request to index.php.
4. It analyzes the response to see if the injected query was successful by looking for "Autor: " string in the response.
5. If a character is found, it is appended to a string, otherwise the script goes to the next possible char.
6. The extracted password hash is then decoded from base64 and presented as a SHA1 hash.

This is a clear example of a blind SQL injection vulnerability with a provided proof-of-concept exploit.
