Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `articles.php` script of SmartSiteCMS 1.0, which is susceptible to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input. The `var` parameter in the URL is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Blind SQL injection. The application does not directly display the results of the SQL query, making it a blind injection. The attacker must infer the results by observing the application's behavior.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as user passwords. In this case, the exploit specifically targets the `users` table to extract the password hash.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attack is performed over HTTP.
    *   The attacker manipulates the `var` parameter in the `articles.php` URL.
    *   The exploit sends a crafted request to the server to trigger the SQL injection.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`articles.php`) and the target user's username.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Python script automates the process of exploiting the blind SQL injection:

1.  **Setting the query:**
    *   `set_query(self,n,ch)`: Constructs a SQL query that checks if the `n`-th character of the user's password matches the character `ch`.
    *   The crafted SQL query uses `ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT password FROM users WHERE userName='<user>'),<n>,1)) = <ascii_value>` to compare one character at a time.
    *   The query uses `' OR '1'='2` to ensure a valid SQL statement is formed.
2.  **Checking the response:**
    *   `check()`: Sends the crafted HTTP request to the server and inspects the response for a specific HTML comment ("<!-- END OF RELATED ARTICLES -->").
    *   The presence or absence of this comment indicates whether the injected condition is true or false.
    *   This behavior is used to infer the value of each character of the password.
3.  **Exploitation:**
    *   The script iterates through characters from 1 to 32, which is assumed to be the length of the password hash.
    *   For each position, it tries all possible characters (ASCII values 0-255) until the `check()` returns true.
    *   The discovered characters are combined to form the password hash.
