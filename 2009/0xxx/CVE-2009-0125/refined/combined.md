Subject: libnasl: Return values of DSA\_do\_verify
Date: Sun, 11 Jan 2009 20:24:30 +0100
```
Package: libnasl
Severity: serious
Tags: security

Hi,

I've been checking packages to see if they properly check the return
value of some of the functions in openssl.  In nasl/nasl_crypto2.c
there is this code:
  if (DSA_do_verify((unsigned char*)data, datalen, sig, dsa))
     retc->x.i_val = 1;

But DSA_do_verify() can return 0 or -1 in case of errors.  A good way
to check the value would be something like:
  if (DSA_do_verify((unsigned char*)data, datalen, sig, dsa) == 1)

I have no idea if this code is being used and what the consequences
of this might be.

Kurt

```

Hi,

I saw that you wrote:

> associated with the misuse of this function.

I would like to start by saying that I have no idea how it works.
But I have to wonder why you call DSA_do_verify() if it the result
has no impact on the security.

Did you considered a man in the middle attack, where the attacker
could impersonate the 2 other parties and have full control over
the connection?

Kurt

Fedora has shipped security advisories related to this bug in Nessus,
I understand, then, that we do not need to do likewise.

Hi,

I attached an email I got back from Renaud Deraison which
basicly states that all the error case that DSA_do_verify()
checks are already checked before the call to DSA_do_verify()
and that DSA_do_verify() should not return -1.

Subject: Package libnasl has been removed from Debian
Date: Sat, 29 Aug 2009 09:58:14 +0100
```
Version: 2.2.11-1+rm

You filled the bug <http://bugs.debian.org/511517> in Debian BTS
against the package libnasl. I'm closing it at *unstable*, but it will
remain open for older distributions.

For more information about this package's removal, read
<http://bugs.debian.org/534506>. That bug might give the reasons why
this package was removed and suggestions of possible replacements.

Don't hesitate to reply to this mail if you have any question.

Thank you for your contribution to Debian.

Subject: CVE Request -- tsqllib, slurm-llnl, libnasl,
	libcrypt-openssl-dsa-perl, erlang, boinc-client, m2crypto

Hello Steve,

  could you please allocate CVE ids for the following OpenSSL's
CVE-2008-5077 related issues:

tsqllib:  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479650>
          <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511509>

libnasl: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479655>
         <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511517>

boinc-client: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479664>
              <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511521>

m2crypto: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479676>
          <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511515>

Other related issues (probably more to come):
slurm-llnl:                 <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511511>
libcrypt-openssl-dsa-perl:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511519>
erlang:                     <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511520>
                            (Lower severity issue due the fact, the output of
                             DSA_do_verify function is further processed and
                             sent back to the caller, where it is compared against 1:

>>From lib/crypto/src/crypto.erl:

dss_verify(Dgst,Signature,Key) ->
    control(?DSS_VERIFY, [Dgst,Signature,Key]) == <<1>>.

Thanks, Jan.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- boinc-client
The boinc-client was missing return value checks for openssl function
calls. (CVE-2009-0126)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xrdp
This update fixes multiple buffer overflows that can be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5902, CVE-2008-5903,
CVE-2008-5904)
Additionally xrdp does not register remote session as local anymore.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- phpMyAdmin
A version upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.4 to fix various security
bugs. (CVE-2008-2960, CVE-2008-3197, CVE-2008-1149, CVE-2008-1567,
CVE-2008-1924, CVE-2008-4096, CVE-2008-4326, CVE-2008-5621, CVE-2008-5622)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- libnasl
This update of libnasl adds missing return value checks for openssl
function calls. (CVE-2009-0125)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- moodle
Insufficient quoting of wiki page titles allowed attackers to
conduct cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2008-5432)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- net-snmp
Remote attackers could crash net-snmp via GETBULK-Request
(CVE-2008-4309).
In addition the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- typo in error message
- make OIDs longer than 256 chars work
- typo in the snmpd init script to really load all agents
- logrotate config to restart the snmptrapd as well
Affected products: SLES9, NLD9, SLES10, SLED 10
- audiofile
A heap-overflow in libaudiofile was fixed. The overflow existsed
in the WAV processing code and can be exploited to execute arbi-
trary code. (CVE-2008-5824)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- XFree86/xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command
execution was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an
xterm. (CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Support for Matrox G200EV/G200WB cards was added.
Affected products: OES, SLES9, NLD9
- amarok
This update of amarok fixes several integer overflows and unchecked
memory allocations that can be exploited by malformed Audible digital
audio files. These bugs could be used in a user-assisted attack sce-
nario to execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2009-0135, CVE-2009-
0136)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLED10
- libpng
This update of libpng fixes the function png\_check\_keyword() that
allowed setting arbitrary bytes in the process memory to 0.
(CVE-2008-5907)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- sudo
This update of sudo fixes a bug that allowed - depending on the
sudoers rules - a sudo-user to execute arbitrary shell commands as
root. (CVE-2009-0034)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- avahi
Specially crafted mDNS packets could crash the Avahi daemon
(CVE-2008-5081).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED10

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
