Title: CA20090107-01: CA Service Metric Analysis and CA Service
Level Management smmsnmpd Arbitrary Command Execution
Vulnerability
CA Advisory Reference: CA20090107-01
CA Advisory Date: 2009-01-07
Reported By:
Michel Arboi of Tenable Network Security
Impact: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands.
Summary: CA Service Metric Analysis and CA Service Level
Management contain a vulnerability that can allow a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary commands. CA has issued patches to
address the vulnerability. The vulnerability, CVE-2009-0043,
is due to insufficient access restrictions associated with the
smmsnmpd service. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability
to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the service.
Mitigating Factors: None
Severity: CA has given this vulnerability a High risk rating.
Affected Products:
CA Service Level Management 3.5
CA Service Metric Analysis r11.0
CA Service Metric Analysis r11.1
CA Service Metric Analysis r11.1 SP1
Affected Platforms:
Windows
Status and Recommendation:
CA has issued the following patches to address the
vulnerabilities.
CA Service Level Management 3.5:
RO04649
CA Service Metric Analysis r11.0:
RO04653
CA Service Metric Analysis r11.1,
CA Service Metric Analysis r11.1 SP1:
RO04667
How to determine if you are affected:
1. Run the ApplyPTF utility (preferably the latest one from CA)
on the machine where SMA/SLM is installed.
2. Select the option "List PTFs applied on local or remote
nodes." and click Next.
3. Enter the hostname of the machine on which SMA/SLM is
installed in the "List PTF(s) on Node:" input box and make
sure that "List Node Type" is set to "NT". In the input box
"Write Output to File", you may set the complete path to a
text file where the output may be written, for example,
"C:\ptflist.txt". Click Next.
4. Select "UNISLM" in the Product section and click Next.
5. The list of fixes that have been applied on SMA will be
provided in the output section and also written to the file
specified in Step 3.
6. Manually verify if the output contains the following line:
a. If the product version is SMA 11.1x, the line should be
"PTF Wizard installed T5LX006".
b. If the product version is SLM 3.5, the line should be "PTF
Wizard installed T5LX007".
c. If the product version is SMA 11.0, the line should be
"PTF Wizard installed T5LX008".
7. If the line is not present, then the product is vulnerable;
else, it has been patched.
