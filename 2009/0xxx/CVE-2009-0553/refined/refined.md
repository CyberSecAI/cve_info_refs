Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2009-0553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of CVE-2009-0553 is an uninitialized memory corruption vulnerability in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Memory Access:** The core issue lies in the browser's attempt to access memory associated with an object that hasn't been properly set up or has already been released. This leads to undefined behavior, which an attacker can exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete control of the system if the user has administrative rights.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted Web Page:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that host user-generated content/ads.
- **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can trick users into visiting the malicious websites via links in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the victim's machine.
-   **Hosting Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to host the crafted web page on a server.
-   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to visit the malicious website via Internet Explorer.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is specific to certain versions of Internet Explorer.
-   The provided Microsoft document provides workarounds, such as setting security settings to High, disabling ActiveX controls and Active Scripting, and adding trusted sites.
-   The vulnerability is addressed by the MS09-014 security update.
-   The vulnerability was reported through responsible disclosure, meaning that Microsoft was notified by researchers before the vulnerability was made public, and therefore, no public reports of exploitation existed at the time of the advisory.
-   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6 SP1 on Windows 2000 SP4, Internet Explorer 6 and 7 on Windows XP, Server 2003, and Windows Vista, depending on the version and OS architecture. IE8 is listed as non affected.
