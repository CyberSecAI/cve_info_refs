Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0574:

**CVE Description:**  The provided text doesn't include the official CVE description. However, the exploit-db entry refers to it as "CafeEngine - 'catid' SQL Injection".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `catid` parameter in the `index.php` script of CafeEngine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries via the `catid` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, database names and versions.
- **Data Manipulation:**  With further exploitation, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data integrity issues.
- **Potential System Compromise:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can be leveraged to execute system commands if database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `index.php`, injecting SQL code within the `catid` parameter.
   - Example: `http://127.0.0.1/index.php?catid=4%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%201,2,3,Group_concat(user(),0x3a,database(),0x3a,version()),5,6,7,8,9,10--`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **No prior authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the usage of `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract data.
- The application is "EASY CAFE ENGINE" and available on http://cafeengine.com/
- The exploit was published on 2009-02-06.
