1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or

more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

- net-snmp
With this update of net-snmp the handling of TCP wrappers rules for
client authorization was improved, prior to this update it was possible
for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and execute
SNMP queries. (CVE-2008-6123)
Additionally binding to multiple interfaces was improved.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE9-11
- ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick
This update of ImageMagick fixes an integer overflow in the XMakeImage()
function that allowed remote attackers to cause a denial-of-service and
possibly the execution of arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF file.
(CVE-2009-1882)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE9-11
- perl/perl-Compress-Raw-Zlib

- ipsec-tools/novell-ipsec-tools
This update of ipsec-tools fixes a crash of racoon in ISAKMP's de-
fragmentation code due to a NULL-pointer dereference. (CVE-2009-1574)
Additionally multiple memory leaks were fixed that allowed to execute
a remote denial of service attack. (CVE-2009-1632)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE9-11
- poppler/libpoppler3/libpoppler4

Further a denial of service bug in function FormWidgetChoice::loadDefaults()
(CVE-2009-0755) and JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg() (CVE-2009-0756) was closed
that could be triggered via malformed PDF files.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE9-11
- yast2-ldap-server
The YaST2 LDAP module in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 did not
initialize the firewall configuration during second stage

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Subject: CVE Request: Poppler -Two Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

 From Secunia [1]:

--->8---
Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Poppler, which can be
exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).

1) An uninitialised memory access error in the
"FormWidgetChoice::loadDefaults()" function can be exploited to cause a
crash via a specially crafted PDF document.

2) An error in the "JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg()" function can be
exploited to cause a crash via a specially crafted PDF document.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
