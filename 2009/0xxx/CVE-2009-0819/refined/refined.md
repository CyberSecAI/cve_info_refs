```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in the XPath parsing logic within the `updatexml` and `extractvalue` functions. Specifically, the code fails to properly handle cases where a scalar expression (like a literal, number, variable, or scalar function call) is used as a `FilterExpr` when it should be a node-set expression.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper handling of scalar expressions where a node-set expression is expected.
- Lack of validation or type checking for `FilterExpr` within the XPath parsing routine.
- An assertion failure in `item_xmlfunc.cc` at line 2507 due to `xpath->context` being null when it should not be.

Impact of exploitation:
- Server crash (Denial of Service - DoS) due to an assertion failure, making the database unavailable.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a specifically crafted SQL query using `updatexml` or `extractvalue` functions with a scalar expression in the XPath where a node set is expected.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- A valid user account with direct access to the MySQL server capable of executing arbitrary SQL statements.
- The user's access is not blocked by any firewall or access control mechanism and they are connecting from an authorized location for the account.
- SQL injection vulnerability in an application may be leveraged to exploit this if applications do all the database access.
