# 3.2, 3.0.6, 2.22.6, and 3.3.1 Security Advisory

Monday, Feb 2nd, 2009
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* It was possible for users to upload a malicious attachment to
  that would run in the context of Bugzilla's domain (thus
  circumventing cross-site request protections in browsers).

* Bug updating was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery.
  Note that this issue was only fixed for 3.2.1 and 3.3.2 even though
  all versions of Bugzilla are affected (see below for an explanation).

* Keywords, unused flag types, and saved searches could be deleted via
  cross-site request forgery. Also, a user's preferences could be
  changed via cross-site request forgery.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Abuse of Functionality (Attachments)
Affected:    Every version before 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, or 3.3.2
Fixed In:    2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, 3.3.2
Description: Bugzilla users can upload HTML or JavaScript attachments
             that are then viewed by other users in their web browsers.
             A malicious user could trick another Bugzilla user into
             viewing a malicious attachment that could then operate
             as that user. Since Bugzilla would view attachments
             using the same domain name as the rest of the application,
             such malicious attachments could access the cookies of
             the user and perform other activities usually restricted
             by the cross-site request protections of web browsers.

             Bugzilla now provides a two-fold solution to this problem:

             Bugzilla 2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, and 3.3.2 now prevent
             users from viewing attachments in their browsers, by
             default. There is a new parameter named
             "allow_attachment_display" that administrators can enable
             to override this protection.

             Once this parameter is turned on, Bugzilla 3.0.7, 3.2.1,
             and 3.3.2 allow administrators to specify that attachments
             should be viewed using a different domain. This increases
             safety for the end user by enabling the browser's
             cross-domain request protections.

             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=472206

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    Every version before 3.2.1 or 3.3.2
Fixed In:    3.2.1, 3.3.2
Description: Bug updating was vulnerable to a cross-site request
             forgery, because it did not validate that calls to
             process_bug.cgi actually came from Bugzilla.

             Bugzilla now generates a token that is validated when
             process_bug.cgi is called. This may break automated
             scripts that call process_bug.cgi directly, unless they
             first load show_bug.cgi to get a valid token.

             Unfortunately, a fix for this issue was only possible for
             3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Fixing it on earlier branches would have
             broken Bugzilla's mid-air collision functionality.

             It should be noted that this issue actually was not a
             secret--it has been public knowledge for quite some time.
             It is only included in this security advisory to note that
             a fix is now available.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26257

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    All Versions (for keywords and user preferences), 2.17 and higher (for flags), 3.0 and higher (for saved searches)
Fixed In:    2.22.7, 3.0.7, 3.2.1, 3.3.2
Description: When deleting saved searches, keywords, or unused
             (never set on any bug or attachment) flags, or when a user
             updated their preferences, Bugzilla did not properly
             validate that the request came from Bugzilla. So, it was
             possible to trick a user into click on a link that would
             perform these actions without their consent.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #281181](/show_bug.cgi?id=281181 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] It's way too easy to delete versions/components/milestones etc...") +++
This may have been covered before a long time ago, and not been considered an issue, but if I could get an admin to click on the following URLs (which are intentionally broken to avoid any accidents, but you get the point), this could really mess things up, couldn't it?
http://[webserver]/editkeywords.cgi?action=delete&id=[number]
http://[webserver]/editflagtypes.cgi?action=confirmdelete&id=[number]
... and especially if it is in fact a script or a "page" with embedded "images" or iframes enumerating all possible values of [number].
Would it make sense for an equivalent "token" to be embedded in the URL for keyword/flag/(etc.?) deletion? ... or for any other significant privileged action accessed via GET?
A malicious user would not know what to supply to make an admin click on (e.g.):
http://[webserver]/editkeywords.cgi?action=delete&id=[number]&token=[token]
... and unlike "all possible values of [number]", certainly couldn't enumerate "all possible values of [token]" too.

editkeywords.cgi and editflagtypes.cgi do not appear to use any token in 3.2rc2 (or at least, there is no 'token' in the page source, nor in the target URL of the delete links)
http://[webserver]/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=forget&namedcmd=[name]
while we're at it too... force any user to delete a saved search (maybe a popular shared one?)

They all check tokens using check\_token\_data(). The saved search deletion is not a security bug, first because it has no security implications, and secondly because you cannot know other users' saved searches.

On a test installation of 3.2rc2, the link for deleting a flag was:
<http://10.96.96.20:8000/editflagtypes.cgi?action=confirmdelete&id=3>
Copy-pasting that link from this very bug report to another browser window did in fact delete the flag. I see no token in the URL.

|  | |

Re-opening - maybe someone with appropriate permissions may care to put the security flag back on until there is something more than mere assertion to suggest this bug does not exist.
Have now checked source... the apparent bug for flags seems to be here:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/source/editflagtypes.cgi#461>
463 my $token = issue\_session\_token('delete\_flagtype');
464 deleteType($flag\_type, $token);
the token that is checked in the deleteType function appears to be issued in the very same call to the CGI... this seems to be mitigated by only being possible for flags which are not currently used on any bugs though.
For keywords, there is a similar apparent bug in editkeywords.cgi,
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/bugzilla/source/editkeywords.cgi#159>
159 # We need this token even if there is no bug using this keyword.
160 $token = issue\_session\_token('delete\_keyword');
161
162 if (!$cgi->param('reallydelete') && $keyword->bug\_count) {
...
169 }
170 # We cannot do this check earlier as we have to check 'reallydelete' first.
171 check\_token\_data($token, 'delete\_keyword');
the token checked appears to be one that was generated just a couple of lines of code earlier. Given that an attacker can arrange for $cgi->param('reallydelete') to have a "desired" value, the if(...) block is irrelevant so there would not appear to be similar mitigation for keywords.
A quick check of other uses of issue\_session\_token suggests that these are the only two instances where the token is used immediately rather than passed to a template.
(In reply to [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=466692#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] keywords and unused flag types can be deleted by bypassing the token check"))

Shared searches are visible to all members of the relevant group. e.g.
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=run&namedcmd=Bugzilla%20blockers&sharer_id=120380>
seems trivially modifiable to:
https://[munged-to-prevent-accidents]/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=forget&namedcmd=Bugzilla%20blockers
... which if someone were to persuade sharer\_id=120380 to click on it might have somewhat undesired consequences, albeit less severe than a widely used keyword unexpectedly disappearing.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: INVALID → ---

OK, your last comment is much clearer and tokens are indeed incorrectly validated when deleting keywords and unused flag types. The shared queries problem is another, separate bug as they current don't use the token check at all.Assignee: administration → LpSolitGroup: bugzilla-securitySeverity: major → normalStatus: REOPENED → ASSIGNEDSummary: [SECURITY] It's way too easy to delete keywords/flags (etc...?) → [SECURITY] keywords and unused flag types can be deleted by bypassing the token checkTarget Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 2.22Version: 3.2 → 2.22.1

The only way to correctly fix this bug is to 1) display the deletion confirmation page in all cases, as we do with other field values, and 2) separate the code related to the confirmation page and the deletion itself. editflagtypes.cgi and editkeywords.cgi have these flaws since their initial checkin 6-8 years ago. But I set the version field to 2.22.1 which is when we first introduced token checks in admin pages.

> OK, your last comment is much clearer...
Apologies if initial report was unclear - it was based merely on observing the HTML output and the content of the link that resulted in the destructive action - these had given the impression that these CGIs didn't use tokens at all, hence mirroring the previous report that had resulted in use of tokens for other destructive admin actions.
Adding further report for the separate bug...

Another way might be to issue a token one page earlier, so that it is in the original link?

Note that because there is extensive discussion of another security issue in this bug, I can not make this bug public until that other bug is fixed. So this bug will remain closed even when the security advisory is sent.
