      "source": "docs.microsoft.com_4f341b67_20250124_204357.html",
      "summary": "The vulnerability is due to the RPCSS service improperly isolating processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine. This vulnerability affects Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, and all supported versions and editions of Windows Server 2003."
