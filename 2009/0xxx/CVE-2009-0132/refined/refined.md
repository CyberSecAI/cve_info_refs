Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-0132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `aiosuspend()` function in the Solaris kernel's `aio.c` file. This function is part of the asynchronous I/O (AIO) system call handling.
*   The core issue is an integer overflow that occurs when calculating the memory size (`ssize`) needed for an internal data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `aiosuspend()` function takes a user-controlled integer `nent` as input which specifies the number of entries. In 32-bit mode, `ssize` is calculated by multiplying `nent` by the size of a pointer (`sizeof(aiocb_t *)` or `sizeof(caddr32_t)`).
*   By providing a large value for `nent` (specifically `0x3fffffff`), an integer overflow occurs in the multiplication. This results in a calculated `ssize` of 0, meaning that 0 bytes of memory are allocated.

*  **Unchecked Memory Allocation:** The `kmem_alloc()` function is then called with a size of 0 bytes.

*   **Kernel Panic:** Further down in the call chain, the `vmem_xalloc()` function receives this size of 0 and causes a kernel panic by calling `umem_panic()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a system crash (kernel panic), rendering the system unusable.
*   **Impact on Solaris Zones:** Because all Solaris Zones (Containers) share the same kernel, the vulnerability can be exploited from within an unprivileged non-global zone, crashing the entire system and all zones.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user.
*   **System Call:** The attacker needs to make a `SYS_kaio` system call and use the `AIOSUSPEND` operation.
*   **Controlled Parameters:** The attacker has to control the parameter 'nent' to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a user account on the target Solaris system to make the necessary system calls.
*   **Unprivileged Access:** No root or special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability. This includes access from unprivileged zones/containers.

**Summary of Technical Details**
The advisory explains that the user-controlled parameter "nent" is used to calculate the size of a memory allocation, resulting in an integer overflow when a large value (0x3fffffff) is provided. This overflow causes kmem\_alloc to be called with a size of zero, which in turn causes a kernel panic, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Vulnerable Systems:**
*   Solaris 8, 9 and 10 (both SPARC and x86) without specific patches
*   OpenSolaris prior to an unspecified fix

**Patch Information**

*   Solaris 8: Patches 117350-59 (SPARC) and 117351-59 (x86) or later.
*  Solaris 9: Patches 138577-01 (SPARC) and 138578-01 (x86) or later.
*   Solaris 10: Patches 121394-02 (SPARC) and 121395-02 (x86) or later.
*   OpenSolaris build TBC
