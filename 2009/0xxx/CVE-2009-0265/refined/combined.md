Would someone be able to provide some more details as to what
particular configurations of BIND this affects? My interpretation is
it only impacts recursive nameservers that have DNSSEC validation
enabled. Speaking in terms of BIND config options, the dnssec-
validation option would need to be set to yes (so just having the
default of dnssec-enable set to yes isn't enough to make the server
vulnerable). Is this a correct interpretation?

Thanks,
Dave Coulthart

The OpenSSL vulnerability affects DSA and ECDSA certificates; an
attacker is able to bypass validation of the certificate. Since DNSSEC
uses ECDSA, this means an attacker could use a forged certificate in a
man-in-the-middle attack.

If you're not using DNSSEC, then this vulnerability doesn't really
affect you, since you already have no way of knowing if a MITM attack is
occurring.

And not even all of those. It only affects DSA signatures (RSA is not
affected), and only if an attacker can provoke a rather peculiar error
condition.

The root problem, which was also behind the recent OpenSSL release, is
that a couple of the low-level OpenSSL libcrypto library functions
that deal with DSA signatures return a tri-state value rather than a
boolean: 1 == success, 0 == bad signature, -1 == other failure (eg,
malloc() failure). The corresponding RSA functions return boolean
values, this is a peculiarity of the DSA routines. Due to the, um,
minimal nature of the OpenSSL internals documentation, a lot of code
that calls the OpenSSL DSA was not checking the error returns
correctly, and was misinterpreting "other" errors as success. Among
others, affected code included both a few routines in BIND's DNSSEC
code and portions of OpenSSL itself (if you look closely at the recent
OpenSSL release, you'll see that there were a bunch of little changes
in libssl to fix this).

So an attacker trying to exploit this vulnerablity would have to
provoke an "other" error while the victim was validating a DSA
signature. This is pretty freaking unlikely, hence the "Severity:
low" rating on the BIND security advisory, but as nobody can prove
that this can't be done and BIND really wasn't checking the return
code correctly, it seemed best to handle the fix as a security issue.

"Vulnerable" in this case means "could be tricked into believing
DNSSEC signatures that should not have passed validation". That is,
we're not talking about named crashing here, we're talking about a
security mechanism not working as expected due to a bug.

If you don't have DNSSEC validation enabled you presumably have no
expectation that DNSSEC signatures will be checked correctly, so,
indeed, you are "not affected", in that without DNSSEC there are
easier ways to feed you bad data.

s/certificate/RRSIG/ (DNSSEC doesn't use certificates).

Exactly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
