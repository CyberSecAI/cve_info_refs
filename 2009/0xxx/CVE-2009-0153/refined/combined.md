| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-28 17:06:04 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-0153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0153) to the following vulnerability:  International Components for Unicode (ICU) in Apple Mac OS X 10.5 before 10.5.7 does not properly handle invalid byte sequences during Unicode conversion, which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3549> <http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2009/May/msg00002.html> <http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA09-133A.html> <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34926> <http://secunia.com/advisories/35074> <http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2009/1297> <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/50488>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c1)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-28 17:11:32 UTC  ``` This issue was originally reported upstream in 2007:  <http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/5691>  The following patchsets are linked to the bug to correct the issue:  <http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/search?q=%22ticket:5691:%22&noquickjump=1&changeset=on>  Most of the patches apply to RHEL5 with some rejects, so they need to be backported to the earlier versions.  According to the release notes, 4.0.1 contains the fix:  <http://icu-project.org/download/4.0.html>  This means that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Directory Server 8, MRG-1, and Fedora 9 and 10 are affected.  Also looking at the release notes, icu4j did not receive any fixes for this issue so would likely not be vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c2)  Rich Megginson    2009-05-28 17:35:46 UTC  ``` Was this flaw in ICU 3.6 or earlier versions?  If so, only directory server on Fedora is affected.  Red Hat Directory Server is supported on RHEL4, RHEL5, Solaris, and HP-UX.  On RHEL4, Solaris, and HP-UX, we distribute ICU 3.6.  On RHEL5, we use ICU provided by the OS, which is version 3.6 release 5.11.2 on my RHEL5.3 system.  So I'm not sure if this affects Red Hat Directory Server.  For Fedora (389) Directory Server, I suppose it would be affected on those systems that use ICU 4.0.  But I'm not clear on the nature of the vulnerability.  Is there something directory server can do to workaround the vulnerability, or is the only recourse to use a patched ICU 4.0.1?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c3)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-28 18:07:59 UTC  ``` Judging by the number of bits that applied clean to RHEL5's icu (3.6), I would say that yes it affects 3.6.  My manifest shows:  fedora:9/icu-3.8.1-7.fc9 fedora:epel:4/icu-3.6-4.el4.20 enterprise_linux:5:u2:server/icu-3.6-5.11.1 enterprise_linux:5:u3:client/icu-3.6-5.11.1 enterprise_linux:5:u3:server/icu-3.6-5.11.1 directory_server:8.1::el4/icu-3.6-4.el4dsrv directory_server:8.1::sparc/icu-3.6-1 enterprise_mrg:1.1::el4/icu-3.6-5.12.el4  Yes, this would affect Directory Server (perhaps not on RHEL5 directly, but RHEL5 itself needs a fixed icu also).  To be honest, the details are quite sparse and I'm not aware of a reproducer for the issue, so I can't say if there is a workaround we could use on Directory Server (or anywhere else for that matter).  The upstream bug has more details on the issue.  This looks to be a problem only when converting to Unicode (possibly just from UTF-8, but it looks like there are some other charsets that it would be problematic with as well).  Without knowing how Directory Server is using uci, I can't really guess at a workaround.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c4)  Rich Megginson    2009-05-28 20:37:40 UTC  ``` The directory server uses iconv to do charset <-> utf8 conversion for data coming from a client.  We use u_strToUTF8 to convert resource bundle strings to utf8.  The only way to exploit this then in the directory server would be for someone to hack into the system an change one of the read-only resource bundles supplied with the server package.  The fedora-ds-dsgw package, not supported for RHDS, only via Fedora, does use ucnv_toUnicode and ucnv_fromUnicode.  So I suppose an attack vector would be for a malicious user to store bogus data in the directory server then retrieve it.  When the directory server stores the data, it is converted from the native charset to utf8 and stored in the DS as utf8.  When retrieved, it is converted from utf8 to the native charset.  This assumes the malicious user has write privileges to the DS, or has somehow identified data already in the DS that can be exploited in this manner.  So - Red Hat Directory Server is not affected.  The fedora-ds-dsgw package is affected, and the resolution is to upgrade ICU to 4.0.1 or later.  However, we should upgrade Red Hat Directory Server to use ICU 4.0.1 on all the platforms that we support.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c5)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-28 21:14:03 UTC  ``` So you think it would be better to respin to 4.0.1 on all platforms instead of backporting the fixes?  I can see this on Fedora, no problem.  I can even see this on Directory Server for the other platforms, but I'm not sure about respinning to 4.0.1 on RHEL5, unless it's there specifically for Directory Server.  I don't have the data yet to determine what requires icu in RHEL5, but in Fedora 10 it is boost, OpenOffice.org, and WebKit-gtk.  Of those, only WebKit-gtk is not included in RHEL5.  I'm not sure how intrusive the changes from 3.6 to 4.0.1 is, so I can't really comment on whether or not this is feasible for RHEL5, but we cannot have any ABI changes there so if the ABI has changed then we must backport on RHEL5 at least, which may impact Directory Server.  Do you have to make actual code changes to Directory Server to work with 4.0.1 do you know?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c6)  Rich Megginson    2009-05-28 21:40:55 UTC  ``` I was talking only about the ICU we distribute with directory server.  For the other platforms, I suppose it's up to the ICU maintainer to figure out which way is best.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c7)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-28 22:42:24 UTC  ``` Fair enough.  Caolan, how would you like to handle the icu packages for RHEL5 and the rest?  The appropriate patches have been found, so I think we should patch RHEL5 instead of respinning to 4.0.1.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c8)  Caolan McNamara    2009-05-29 07:28:38 UTC  ``` We've got 3.6 in RHEL-5 and changing to a 4.X would change the behaviour of at least keyboard traversal of Indic clusters, etc and a load of other behavioural stuff that wouldn't be good to see changed in a security update. (And every icu major version has a different SONAME requiring re-building everything that depends on it unless we hack it to not do that).  We'd really have to patch instead of re-spinning. This issue really sounds very similar to [CVE-2008-1036](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-1036).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c9)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-29 15:32:56 UTC  ``` Thanks for spelling that out. I suspected a rebase would be a no-go (we usually don't like doing that to begin with).  It makes me also think that rebasing for Directory Server may not be wise either.  And yes, it does sound similar, but it is not the same issue.  There was some confusion about this at first, but Apple cleared it up as noted with the upstream bug reference.  The patches I've linked to apply for the most part, but there is some backporting you need to do to get it to fully apply to 3.6.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c10)  Caolan McNamara    2009-06-02 16:09:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 346280](attachment.cgi?id=346280 "proposed backports .src.rpm") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=346280&action=edit "proposed backports .src.rpm") proposed backports .src.rpm  Where some backporting == quite a lot of backporting.  So, good few patches required really. Attached a .src.rpm as the order matters and the previous [CVE-2008-1036](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-1036) change needs regenerating as well. *should* be abi compatible and fix this problem (definitely the test added to test the problem passes fine)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c11)  Vincent Danen    2009-06-10 20:33:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c4))  > The fedora-ds-dsgw package, not supported for RHDS, only via Fedora, does use > ucnv_toUnicode and ucnv_fromUnicode.

Note that Fedora 11 has 4.0.1.  I'm not sure if RHDS follows a different policy than other products, but we typically prefer to backport fixes as required and refrain from rebasing packages to the latest versions to prevent ABI changes, or other changes and bugs that new versions tend to introduce and can have unintended consequences with other packages.  Also, if this issue does not even affect RHDS in that the vulnerabilities in question are not used by RHDS, then upgrading is spurious as it doesn't really fix anything.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c15)  Vincent Danen    2009-06-10 23:03:13 UTC  ``` Caolan, can you make sure this gets updated for Fedora 9 and Fedora 10 please?  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c16)  Caolan McNamara    2009-06-11 09:15:01 UTC  ``` >>(definitely the test added to test the problem passes fine)  >The test you're referring to is in the patch itself?  Can you clarify that?   Yes, icu has a make check and as part of their fixes for this they added extra test-cases to that make check for the encodings affected by this. With the above set of inter-locking backports the make check passes, so the built-in test passes.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=503071#c17)  Vincent Danen    2009-06-11 15:54:16 UTC  ``` Ok, thanks for the clarification.  Please let me know when you have packages prepared for RHEL5.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
