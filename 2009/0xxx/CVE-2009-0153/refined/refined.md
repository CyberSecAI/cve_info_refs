  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2009-0153",
    "description": "An implementation issue exists in ICU's handling of certain character encodings. Using ICU to convert invalid byte sequences to Unicode may result in over-consumption, where trailing bytes are considered part of the original character. This may be leveraged by an attacker to bypass filters on websites that attempt to mitigate cross-site scripting. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of invalid byte sequences.",
    "affectedSystems": [
      "Apple Mac OS X versions prior to and including 10.4.11 (Tiger) and 10.5.6 (Leopard)",
      "Apple Mac OS X Server versions prior to and including 10.4.11 (Tiger) and 10.5.6 (Leopard)",
       "Safari 3 for Windows, Mac OS X 10.4, and Mac OS X 10.5",
	   "iOS 1.0 through 2.2.1",
        "iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1",
       "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5",
	   "Fedora 9 and 10"
    ],
    "rootCause": "An implementation flaw exists in how ICU handles invalid byte sequences during Unicode conversion. When converting invalid byte sequences, ICU might over-consume bytes, where trailing bytes are incorrectly considered part of the original character.",
    "vulnerability": "Improper handling of invalid byte sequences during Unicode conversion in ICU.",
     "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass website filters that attempt to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By crafting malicious input with specific invalid byte sequences, an attacker could inject scripts into a webpage that would be executed in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing them to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on the victim's behalf.",
    "attackVectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted input with specific invalid byte sequences when converting to Unicode via ICU."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is processed by ICU on the vulnerable system. This could be achieved via malicious websites, manipulating data stored in databases or other vectors that pass user-controlled data through the vulnerable ICU component.",
    "additionalDetails": "This vulnerability stems from a flaw in the ICU library's handling of character encoding conversions. Specifically, the issue occurs when ICU attempts to convert an invalid byte sequence into Unicode. Instead of correctly identifying and handling the invalid sequence, ICU may incorrectly process trailing bytes as part of the original character, which can lead to overconsumption of bytes. This overconsumption allows for a carefully crafted input to be interpreted in a way that bypasses standard website input filters designed to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks."
