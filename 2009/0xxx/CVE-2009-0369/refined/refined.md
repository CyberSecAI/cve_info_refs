- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a clickjacking issue in Internet Explorer 7, allowing an attacker to overlay malicious content over a legitimate webpage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clickjacking, which is a client-side vulnerability. The code provided shows how to create a transparent div element that overlays a link on the original webpage. The onmouseover event redirects the user to a different website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** When a user clicks on what appears to be the legitimate link, they are actually clicking on the attacker's hidden element, leading to unintended actions, such as redirecting to a malicious website.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, through a specially crafted webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host the malicious webpage and lure the victim into visiting it. The attacker also needs to be able to craft the HTML and javascript code to perform the clickjacking.
