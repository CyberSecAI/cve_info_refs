Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) in versions prior to 1.0.4 did not enforce the minimum password age (MINDAYS) setting specified in the `/etc/shadow` file. This means that after an administrator configured a minimum password age using tools like `chage` or `passwd`, PAM would not prevent users from immediately changing their password again, effectively bypassing the policy.
- In older PAM versions, the `_unix_verify_shadow()` function checked the `sp_min` value to enforce the MINDAYS setting. However, this check was removed in newer versions of PAM 1.x.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Password Policy:** The primary vulnerability is the circumvention of the intended password policy. Administrators set MINDAYS to prevent users from changing passwords too frequently, often to avoid immediate reuse of old passwords. This vulnerability allows users to change their passwords regardless of the MINDAYS setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Policy Violation:** The most direct impact is that the organization's password policy, intended to increase security by enforcing password age restrictions, is not enforced.
- **Weakened Password Security:** By allowing users to quickly change passwords, especially immediately after a change, it allows for the potential reuse of previous passwords which can undermine password security.
- **Local Privilege Escalation (potential):** While not a direct privilege escalation, a local user could use this to revert to an older password, if an attacker compromised the password, the user could quickly revert to a known compromised password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any local user who has the ability to change their password on the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Account:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system.
- **Ability to Change Password:** The attacker needs the ability to initiate a password change operation (e.g., through the `passwd` command).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as having a "low" priority and severity, although it has security implications due to bypassing password policies.
- The issue affected all PAM 1.x versions.
- The fix involved backporting code to reintroduce the MINDAYS check in the password change process within PAM.
- Red Hat stated that this issue did not affect the versions of pam shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2009-0579 for tracking.
