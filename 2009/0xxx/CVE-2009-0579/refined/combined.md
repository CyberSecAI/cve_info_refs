| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=487216#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-02-24 20:37:09 UTC  ```  An issue dealing with password changes, with respect to the MINDAYS field in /etc/shadow was reported on the Debian BTS (<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=514437>) that affects all versions of PAM 1.x.  Because of this, if an administrative user sets the password minimum days via chage or passwd, /etc/shadow is updated correctly, but PAM allows the user to change their password with no regard for the MINDAYS setting, effectively allowing them to re-use old passwords immediately and disregard any established password policies that should be enforced.  This is due to the fact that no minimum age password checks are done by PAM in 1.x; in the old versions it was done in _unix_verify_shadow() by checking the value of of sp_min.  In newer PAM this check is no longer there.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=487216#c1)  Vincent Danen    2009-02-24 20:37:38 UTC  ``` Created pam tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: F10 [[bug #487217](show_bug.cgi?id=487217 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2009-0579 pam: MINDAYS not respected by pam for password changing [F10]")] Affects: F9 [[bug #487218](show_bug.cgi?id=487218 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - CVE-2009-0579 pam: MINDAYS not respected by pam for password changing [F9]")] Affects: Fdevel [[bug #487219](show_bug.cgi?id=487219 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - CVE-2009-0579 pam: MINDAYS not respected by pam for password changing [Fdevel]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=487216#c2)  Fedora Update System    2009-03-26 10:46:15 UTC  ``` pam-1.0.4-3.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pam-1.0.4-3.fc9>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=487216#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-03-30 16:43:57 UTC  ``` pam-1.0.4-4.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pam-1.0.4-4.fc9>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=487216#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-03-30 16:45:06 UTC  ``` pam-1.0.4-4.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pam-1.0.4-4.fc10>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=487216#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-14 15:52:54 UTC  ``` pam-1.0.4-4.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

Thanks for reporting this.

Looking at the PAM sources (greping for sp_min), it seems that PAM does
not use this field anymore.

I had a look at PAM 0.79, and this was one check in _unix_verify_shadow,
called from pam_sm_chauthtok.
			if ((curdays < (spwdent->sp_lstchg + spwdent->sp_min))
			    && (spwdent->sp_min != -1))
				retval = PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR;

pam_sm_chauthtok still calls _unix_verify_shadow.
_unix_verify_shadow calls _unix_run_verify_binary and check_shadow_expiry
but those are used by pam_sm_acct_mgmt so the above check cannot be added
there.

I did not change the severity of the bug, but I wonder if it should not be
considered for Lenny.

sp_min is part of the security policy for passwords (it can be used to
forbid users changing their password immediately back to the previous
password).

Best Regards,

Hello,

For tracking purpose, this is [CVE-2009-0579](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0579).

I do not update the bug title because I cannot find this CVE in the
databases (Reserved / Under Review), but it really matches with the
description from upstream and RedHat Bugzilla:

<https://www.redhat.com/archives/pam-list/2009-March/msg00006.html>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=487216>

```
[CVE-2009-0579](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0579) looks like a good candidate for a stable/old-stable
proposed update since it's not really a security issue, but it would be
good for the package to adhere to the administrator's desired policy.

please coordinate with the security team (team@securuty.debian.org) if
you plan to work on an spu/ospu.

best wishes,
mike

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **Debian Bugs** | [514437](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=514437) |

## Vulnerable and fixed packages

The table below lists information on source packages.

| Source Package | Release | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [pam](/tracker/source-package/pam) ([PTS](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pam)) | bullseye | 1.4.0-9+deb11u1 | fixed |
|  | bookworm | 1.5.2-6+deb12u1 | fixed |
|  | sid, trixie | 1.5.3-7 | fixed |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [pam](/tracker/source-package/pam) | source | (unstable) | 1.0.1-10 | unimportant |  | [514437](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=514437) |

## Notes

```
the ability to change a password earlier than scheduled is not a security
vulnerability in itself (unless the user changes their password back to
their previous password; thus violating the security policy as defined by
the administrator)

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
