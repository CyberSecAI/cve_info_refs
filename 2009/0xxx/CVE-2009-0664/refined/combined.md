## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1778-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                 Nico Golde
April 22nd, 2009                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-0664

It was discovered that mahara, an electronic portfolio, weblog, and
resume builder, is prone to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks because
of missing input sanitization of the introduction text field in user
profiles and any text field in a user view.

The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain mahara.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.
