Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-0003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow that occurs while processing AVI movie files. Specifically, a malformed `nBlockAlign` value within the `_WAVEFORMATEX` structure of the AVI header can trigger this overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking during the parsing of AVI files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the current user.
- The vulnerability can also cause an unexpected application termination, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted AVI movie file.
- The malicious AVI file can be hosted on a website or sent via email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious AVI file containing a malformed `nBlockAlign` value in the header.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file. This may involve social engineering or exploiting other vulnerabilities to force the user to view the file.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported to Apple by an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Apple addressed this issue in QuickTime 7.6 by implementing improved bounds checking.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '6642'.
