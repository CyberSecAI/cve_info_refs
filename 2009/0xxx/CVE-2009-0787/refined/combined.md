| [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-20 04:29:46 UTC  ``` Reported by Florian Streibelt. When allocating the memory used to store the eCryptfs header contents, a single, zeroed page was being allocated with get_zeroed_page(). However, the size of an eCryptfs header is either PAGE_CACHE_SIZE or ECRYPTFS_MINIMUM_HEADER_EXTENT_SIZE (8192), whichever is larger, and is stored in the file's private_data->crypt_stat->num_header_bytes_at_front field.  ecryptfs_write_metadata_to_contents() was using num_header_bytes_at_front to decide how many bytes should be written to the lower filesystem for the file header.  Unfortunately, at least 8K was being written from the page, despite the chance of the single, zeroed page being smaller than 8K.  This resulted in random areas of kernel memory being written between the 0x1000 and 0x1FFF bytes offsets in the eCryptfs file headers if PAGE_SIZE was 4K.  The vuln was introduced in upstream commit 87b811c3f9, and it affects upstream kernels version 2.6.28 onwards.  Reference: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/345544](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/%2Bbug/345544)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-20 04:43:25 UTC  ``` eCryptfs is a Technology Preview feature in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3, and it is not a default configuration - <http://markmail.org/message/n2acz2wv7b5xkb2o>.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c6)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-20 06:56:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 335965](attachment.cgi?id=335965&action=diff "Proposed upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=335965&action=edit "Proposed upstream patch") Proposed upstream patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c7)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-23 04:33:32 UTC  ``` It's public now: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=8faece5f906725c10e7a1f6caf84452abadbdc7b>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c8)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-23 04:35:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 336239](attachment.cgi?id=336239&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=336239&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-25 11:31:14 UTC  ``` Encrypted files that were created on systems running vulnerable version of the ecryptfs may contain leaked data in the ecryptfs file headers.   ecryptfs-utils upstream developers created a script that can be used to re-encrypt files inside of ecryptfs mount by making a temporary copy of the file and replacing original with the copy, causing the file to be re-created / re-encrypted on the lower ecryptfs filesystem too.  Script is available in the ecryptfs-utils source code repository:  [http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/ecryptfs-utils/annotate/head:/src/utils/ecryptfs-rewrite-file](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/ecryptfs-utils/annotate/head%3A/src/utils/ecryptfs-rewrite-file) [http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/ecryptfs-utils/annotate/head:/doc/manpage/ecryptfs-rewrite-file.1](http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/ecryptfs-utils/annotate/head%3A/doc/manpage/ecryptfs-rewrite-file.1)  Further information about its use is in the upstream bug report:  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/345544/comments/5](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/%2Bbug/345544/comments/5)  This approach, however, has limitations, as ecryptfs files and mounts are under the control of the individual users.  Script is meant to be used on files inside of an ecryptfs mount.  Therefore, it can not be used to fully "resolve" the consequences this leak under all circumstance, as non-privileged users can not use it to remove "their" data leaked into other users' ecryptfs files, and system administrators can only use it on ecryptfs mounts that are mounted or have pass phrases known to them.  This script may appear in the future updates of the ecryptfs-utils packages.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c11)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-05-06 03:12:44 UTC  ``` More info: <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-16748>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=491254#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-05-07 10:53:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0473 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0473.html>   ``` |  |

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0473)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* a logic error was found in the do\_setlk() function of the Linux kernel

Network File System (NFS) implementation. If a signal interrupted a lock
request, the local POSIX lock was incorrectly created. This could cause a
denial of service on the NFS server if a file descriptor was closed before
its corresponding lock request returned. (CVE-2008-4307, Important)

* a deficiency was found in the Linux kernel system call auditing

implementation on 64-bit systems. This could allow a local, unprivileged
user to circumvent a system call audit configuration, if that configuration
filtered based on the "syscall" number or arguments.
(CVE-2009-0834, Important)

* the exit\_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the

exit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before
exiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)

* a flaw was found in the ecryptfs\_write\_metadata\_to\_contents() function of

the Linux kernel eCryptfs implementation. On systems with a 4096 byte
page-size, this flaw may have caused 4096 bytes of uninitialized kernel
memory to be written into the eCryptfs file headers, leading to an
information leak. Note: Encrypted files created on systems running the
vulnerable version of eCryptfs may contain leaked data in the eCryptfs file
headers. This update does not remove any leaked data. Refer to the
Knowledgebase article in the References section for further information.
(CVE-2009-0787, Moderate)

* the Linux kernel implementation of the Network File System (NFS) did not

properly initialize the file name limit in the nfs\_server data structure.
This flaw could possibly lead to a denial of service on a client mounting
an NFS share. (CVE-2009-1336, Moderate)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* the enic driver (Cisco 10G Ethernet) did not operate under

virtualization. (BZ#472474)

* network interfaces using the IBM eHEA Ethernet device driver could not be

successfully configured under low-memory conditions. (BZ#487035)

* bonding with the "arp\_validate=3" option may have prevented fail overs.

(BZ#488064)

* when running under virtualization, the acpi-cpufreq module wrote "Domain

attempted WRMSR" errors to the dmesg log. (BZ#488928)

* NFS clients may have experienced deadlocks during unmount. (BZ#488929)
* the ixgbe driver double counted the number of received bytes and packets.

(BZ#489459)

* the Wacom Intuos3 Lens Cursor device did not work correctly with the

Wacom Intuos3 12x12 tablet. (BZ#489460)

* on the Itanium(r) architecture, nanosleep() caused commands which used it,

such as sleep and usleep, to sleep for one second more than expected.
(BZ#490434)

* a panic and corruption of slab cache data structures occurred on 64-bit

PowerPC systems when clvmd was running. (BZ#491677)

* the NONSTOP\_TSC feature did not perform correctly on the Intel(r)

microarchitecture (Nehalem) when running in 32-bit mode. (BZ#493356)

* keyboards may not have functioned on IBM eServer System p machines after

a certain point during installation or afterward. (BZ#494293)

* using Device Mapper Multipathing with the qla2xxx driver resulted in

frequent path failures. (BZ#495635)

* if the hypervisor was booted with the dom0\_max\_vcpus parameter set to

less than the actual number of CPUs in the system, and the cpuspeed service
was started, the hypervisor could crash. (BZ#495931)

* using Openswan to provide an IPsec virtual private network eventually

resulted in a CPU soft lockup and a system crash. (BZ#496044)

* it was possible for posix\_locks\_deadlock() to enter an infinite loop

(under the BKL), causing a system hang. (BZ#496842)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. Service Console update for ntp

Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5\_3.2
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
security issues.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
command.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in the Service Console (column 4) if a solution is available.

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
