    "ID": "CVE-2009-0646",
    "content": "The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in 4Site CMS version 2.6. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n- **SQL Injection:** Multiple modules of 4Site CMS, including \"Pages\", \"Portfolio\", \"Hotels\", \"News\", and \"FAQ\", are susceptible to SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n- **Authentication Bypass:** The application also suffers from authentication bypass vulnerability using crafted login credentials.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n- **Data Breach/Modification:** Successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete arbitrary data within the database, potentially including sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, or business records.\n- **Complete System Compromise:** SQL injection vulnerabilities can potentially lead to a complete system compromise by allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and even gain control over the underlying operating system or other connected systems.\n- **Authentication Bypass:** Bypassing the authentication mechanism grants unauthorized access to the application and its functionalities.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n- **HTTP GET parameters:** Vulnerable modules are exploitable via manipulation of HTTP GET parameters. Specifically, the `page` parameter in the \"Pages\" module, the `s` and `i` parameters in the \"Portfolio\" module, the `h` parameter in the \"Hotels\" module, the `id` parameter in the \"News\" module, and the `th` parameter in the \"FAQ\" module are all vulnerable to SQL injection.\n- **Authentication Form:** Crafted login credentials using SQL injection to bypass authentication via the login form.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable web server.\n- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n- An attacker requires a web browser and the ability to send HTTP requests to exploit the web application vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific Exploits:**\n\n- **Authentication Bypass:**\n  - Login: `1'or'1`\n  - Password: `1'or'1`\n- **SQL Injection (example exploits):**\n  - Pages module: `http://vulnerable.site/print/print.shtml?page=-1+union+select+1`\n  - Portfolio module: `http://vulnerable.site/portfolio/index.shtml?s=1&i=-1+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9` or `http://vulnerable.site/portfolio/index.shtml?s=-1+union+select+1`\n  - Hotels module: `http://vulnerable.site/hotel/?h=-1+union+select+1`\n  - News module: `http://vulnerable.site/news/news1.shtml?id=-1+union+select+1,2,3,4`\n  - FAQ module: `http://vulnerable.site/faq/index.shtml?th=-1+union+select+1`",
