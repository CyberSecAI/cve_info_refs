Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0047:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect return code checking after calling the `EVP_VerifyFinal` function in OpenSSL, as well as `DSA_verify` and `DSA_do_verify`. This means that the affected applications might treat a malformed signature as valid, instead of identifying it as an error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Error Handling:** The core issue is the failure to properly validate the return codes from signature verification functions, leading to bypassed signature validations.
*   **API Misuse:** Incorrect use of the OpenSSL API, specifically the `EVP_VerifyFinal`, `DSA_verify`, and `DSA_do_verify` functions are at fault.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassed Signature Validation:** A malicious actor could forge or manipulate digital signatures, potentially bypassing authentication mechanisms and security controls.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** A malicious server or a man-in-the-middle attacker can present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client, causing it to accept an invalid certificate.
*   **Compromised Security:**  Systems and applications relying on these functions could be vulnerable to security breaches, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate entities or intercept communications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Server:** A malicious server can present a malformed SSL/TLS signature to a vulnerable client.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept and modify communications, including the server's certificate chain, presenting a malformed signature.
*  **Vulnerable applications**:  Applications that incorrectly validate signatures using the affected functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate network traffic or to control the server a vulnerable client connects to.
*   **Ability to forge signatures**: The attacker needs to be capable of generating or manipulating malformed signatures for DSA and ECDSA keys.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content indicates that this issue affects signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS. It specifically mentions that the use of RSA keys by clients connecting to servers is NOT affected.
*   The vulnerability is not specific to OpenSSL, as several other packages were identified as having the same flawed return code validation (e.g., NTP, Sun GridEngine, Gale, BIND, Lasso, ZXID etc.)
*   The vulnerability was initially identified in OpenSSL by Google Security Team, and oCERT aided in coordinating remediation across multiple affected projects.
*   The content provides a timeline of the discovery, coordination and remediation efforts
*   The content provides references to the original OpenSSL advisory and BIND advisory.
