```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Python AI module in Wesnoth 1.4.x and 1.5 before 1.5.11 had a flaw in its sandbox implementation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability allowed for the execution of arbitrary Python code due to a whitelisted module importing an unsafe one, enabling access to the unsafe module through hierarchical module names.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code with user account privileges on the client system.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector was through the use of malicious third-party content, such as campaigns downloaded from the add-on server, which contained the exploit code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to create a malicious campaign or other content with Python code designed to exploit the vulnerability, then upload it to a distribution point (e.g., an add-on server), and trick a user into downloading the content.
