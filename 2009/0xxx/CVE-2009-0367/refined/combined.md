Comparing the fixes that Debian performed[1], I think this patch may additionally require fixes for CVE-2009-0366. Also, please follow the changelog format in the Security Update Procedures[2], since that will make it easier for us to examine the patches.

I do have a worry that just ripping out Python is the wrong approach to take with this bug, as that drops features as well. However, in the light of upstream's response to the bug (they did the same), I think it makes sense. Will there be AIs that no longer work if this code is removed from wesnoth?

Not in this version because it doesn't support gzip compression, so the

changes aren't that big. Additionally, the code has changed a fair bit

through the gzip compression addition and I wasn't able to locate the

specific code sections with some quick search. But given that the

execution of arbitrary code on client machines is a fair bit more severe

than this issue I think it's more than acceptable to \_not\_ delay the

python fix any further.

I'm sorry, I'm no MOTU, I can't sign the Ubuntu CoC because with that I

would claim to expect Mark to be perfect, so I haven't tried to dig

further into Ubuntu practises. I just wanted to offer in a best-effort

manner what could help you to get the problem fixed. If you are fine

with letting the users vulnerable to arbitrary code execution that's

fine with me.

And I'm not completely sure why the style of the changelog should

actually make it easier to examine the patch - but then, that might be

just me.

It drops a feature that is dropped in the upcoming 1.6 release and

never really was used anywhere at all but only a single scenario in a

single campaign (which was fixed with the update too, take a look at the

changes that went into jaunty). All user created stuff that is available

through the wesnoth addon server was checked, and given that the

community is pretty tight this is a quite complete check.

Furthermore, if you know a way to properly sandbox python, feel free to

bring it up. The wesnoth team has quite some python evangelists on board

but they were unable to find a way to sanely limit python. Additionally,

it is discussed to replace this feature with a scripting language that

is actually intended to be run in such an environment - so it might come

back eventually (even if it wasn't really used ...).

You might rather want to take a look of this changelog (the one that

went into unstable, not experimental, and through that into jaunty):

<http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/w/wesnoth/wesnoth_1.4.7-4/changelog>

now consider incomplete...) to ease your work for a distribution that I
can't upload to and propably won't be able to do so for a long time (see
CoC issue above). If you don't have interest to get the issue fixed
that's fine with me - I tried to do my best, if that's not enough, I'm
sorry for that.
Slightly disappointed, both from being exhausted and the delay in response.

This isn't so much about 'pleasing us enough' as about ensuring the patch is correct and well tested. This package is in universe and is community supported and as such, needs caring people like yourself to tend to it. I'm reviewing the patches today and will report back if I have any questions.

Based on your feedback I am going to push the updates for Gutsy and Hardy today. If you are able, perhaps you could prepare a debdiff to fix both CVE-2009-0366 and CVE-2009-0367 on Intrepid. Thanks for your hard work on this!

I can't completely follow. Is six different patched versions that I did

for Debian (1.2, 1.4.4 (twice in different environment), 1.4.7 (twice in

different environment), 1.5.11) not well enough tested for you? Is the

acceptance by the Debian security team in a DSA not well enough tested

for you?

I really thought I did so - but it's your call to accept it, not mine.

Sure, you're welcome. Btw., for completeness:

#v+

+ - Pull limit-mapsize patch from upstream svn r32987 to avoid hanging of

+ wesnoth/exhausting system memory (Upstream [Bug #13031](/bugs/13031))

#v-

This part in the changelog received a CVE ID in the meantime:

CVE-2009-0878 - you might want to incorporate that into the changelog.

I didn't prepare a patch for intrepid because I was told that there is

an update in intrepid-proposed already and I haven't received any

informations about on which version I should base the patch on - the one

actually \_in\_ intrepid, or the version in intrepid-proposed. About the

backports I guess it's just similar to Debian backports: Taking the new

(security) upload and building it for there, so most propably no patch

needed there, right?

I also know that wesnoth is in universe and don't receive regular

security support - on the other hand, this issue isn't a random DoS but

a arbitrary code execution issue that shouldn't get ignored like it was

in the last weeks. I'm quite a bit disappointed here both with the

delays and with the kind of responses, to say the least. :/

Thanks anyway.

Rhonda, no one is criticizing your work. To the contrary, you have done great work with this. The aforementioned testing is needed to be done on Ubuntu because Ubuntu != Debian. Granted, it will most likely work ok but there have been quite a few times when a tested Debian patch didn't work properly on Ubuntu, due to different versions.

The Ubuntu Security team does not have the resources to patch and test software in universe and multiverse and relies on MOTU Swat and people from the community to maintain this software. I apologize for the delays and am working to get these fixes into Ubuntu.

As for Intrepid, please patch the current version as released in Ubuntu, and add a note to the SRU bug for the -proposed package saying it has to be updated to incorporate these security fixes. Please use a version higher than that in -proposed, following the guidelines in <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityUpdateProcedures>.

I backported the fixes from Jaunty and created the following debdiff and am building it. It would be great if someone could take a look at it and make sure it is ok.

Thanks, this looks almost identical to the patch I was working on. Your

last mail motivated me to give it a try and I just didn't check for the

specific format wishes for the changelog from the wiki page yet - was

busy with getting the 1.6a hotfix release uploaded to Debian and planed

to do it afterwards.

I can confirm that the patch is technically the same that I would have

proposed. Really big thanks to you Jamie for picking it up.

All the best to you, and again: thanks!

Rhonda

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: wesnoth

Please sync wesnoth 1:1.4.7-4 (universe) from Debian unstable (main)

wesnoth (1:1.4.7-4) unstable; urgency=high

   \* Upload to fix several severe problems:

     - Compile with --disable-python because the python AI support allowed to

       break out of sandbox and allowed execution of abitrary code

       (CVE-2009-0367, Upstream [Bug #13048](/bugs/13048)). Don't install data/ais into

       wesnoth-data package anymore, and remove python-dev from

       Build-Dependencies.

     - Pull wesnoth-did-ai-fix patch from upstream svn r33013 to make it still

       work after above changes.

     - Pull limit-mapsize patch from upstream svn r32987 to avoid hanging of

       wesnoth/exhausting system memory (Upstream [Bug #13031](/bugs/13031))

   \* Pulled patch fix-server-dos from upstream svn r33069 which fixes a DoS

     pattern in the server, which came in a bit too late for the release

     (CVE-2009-0366, Upstream [Bug #13037](/bugs/13037))

   \* Fix typo in wesnoth-tools package description noticed by Soliton, thanks.

 -- Gerfried Fuchs <email address hidden> Tue, 24 Feb 2009 16:04:59 +0100

Thanks

Thanks for this, Dylan. I was about to look around for one of my usual suspects to ping them about the issue. Glad I didn't have to do that. :)

Ah yes, if you need help with extracting/applying the diff for the

other ubuntu releases, just give me a call and I'll take a look what I

can do. Please don't forget about them. :)

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: wesnoth

Please sync wesnoth 1:1.4.7-4 (universe) from Debian unstable (main)

wesnoth (1:1.4.7-4) unstable; urgency=high

   \* Upload to fix several severe problems:

     - Compile with --disable-python because the python AI support allowed to

       break out of sandbox and allowed execution of abitrary code

       (CVE-2009-0367, Upstream [Bug #13048](/bugs/13048)). Don't install data/ais into

       wesnoth-data package anymore, and remove python-dev from

       Build-Dependencies.

     - Pull wesnoth-did-ai-fix patch from upstream svn r33013 to make it still

       work after above changes.

     - Pull limit-mapsize patch from upstream svn r32987 to avoid hanging of

       wesnoth/exhausting system memory (Upstream [Bug #13031](/bugs/13031))

   \* Pulled patch fix-server-dos from upstream svn r33069 which fixes a DoS

     pattern in the server, which came in a bit too late for the release

     (CVE-2009-0366, Upstream [Bug #13037](/bugs/13037))

   \* Fix typo in wesnoth-tools package description noticed by Soliton, thanks.

Thanks

Thanks for this, Dylan. I was about to look around for one of my usual suspects to ping them about the issue. Glad I didn't have to do that. :)

Ah yes, if you need help with extracting/applying the diff for the

other ubuntu releases, just give me a call and I'll take a look what I

can do. Please don't forget about them. :)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1737-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Steffen Joeris
March 11, 2009                   <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : wesnoth
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2009-0366 CVE-2009-0367

Several security issues have been discovered in wesnoth, a fantasy
turn-based strategy game. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0366

Daniel Franke discovered that the wesnoth server is prone to a denial of
service attack when receiving special crafted compressed data.

CVE-2009-0367

Daniel Franke discovered that the sandbox implementation for the python
AIs can be used to execute arbitrary python code on wesnoth clients. In
order to prevent this issue, the python support has been disabled. A
compatibility patch was included, so that the affected campagne is still
working properly.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-2+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2-5.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.7-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# CVE 2009-0367

The Python AI module in Wesnoth 1.4.x and 1.5 before 1.5.11 allows remote attackers to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code by using a whitelisted module that imports an unsafe module, then using a hierarchical module name to access the unsafe module through the whitelisted module.

Hi everybody!

As you might have read in the [1.5.11 release announcement](http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=24247), the support for PythonAI was removed. This was done to fix a vulnerability that could allow third-party content (such as campaigns downloaded from the add-on server) to execute arbitrary code with user account privileges. See <https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13048> for details. All content currently on the official add-on server has been inspected to confirm that none of it exploits this vulnerability, and the add-on server itself has been patched to ensure that exploits can no longer be uploaded. Therefore, users of previous versions of Battle for Wesnoth who have received user-made content through the official add-on server and no other distribution channel need not fear that their system has been compromised.

CVE-2009-0367 has been assigned to this vulnerability and may provide further information.

If you are still using 1.4.x and not 1.5.x (why are you doing so btw, switch to the latest dev version, it is "better" and even more stable...), we do advise you to disable Python support if you compiled the binary yourself. All known packagers were contacted and I know about reactions from some of them already. Users of the official Windows binary should not be affected since Python support in it was broken anyway.

IMO it's quite silly. I.E. from the XUL level in firefox addons you can erase whole filesystem and firefox addons are still in use.

Instead of removing python support there should be community server where only trusted (examined by other users) scripts would be available. Other way is to make game to permit loading only signed scripts.

Anyone that plays BfW on Ubuntu Linux and hasn't wandered to this site or bothered to figure out how to obtain v1.6 is probably still at v1.4 because that's what's currently in the official Ubuntu repository. If they haven't been to this site they probably don't even know v1.6 exists.

Wesnoth 1.5.11 is out!

This is the third beta release for 1.6. By now we are basically feature complete and the changes happening from now on are meant to polish existing stuff and wipe out the bugs that are left. So you as user can already consider updating to this new version since it should be basically usable. You should expect a stable 1.6 rather soon, maybe in Q1'2009...

This release is really a bug stomping release. That is in the past 8 days more than 50 reported bugs were tackled, several of them "bigger problems" like crashes or even security risks. So if you are using the 1.5.x series, you really should upgrade to this new release since several issues were tackled. If everything goes well, the new stable 1.6 line will be out soon. Here you can get the first impression of what it might be like.

Some other important things to mention:

\*\*\*

WML authors: the following image files in /data/core/images have been renamed and moved around. The wmllint tool has been updated to help converting existing add-on's for this change.

\* titlescreen/landscapebattlefield.jpg -> story/landscape-battlefield.jpg

\* titlescreen/landscapebridge.jpg -> story/landscape-bridge.jpg

\* titlescreen/landscapecastle.jpg -> story/landscape-castle.jpg

\*\*\*

This release contains an important security update, fixing a vulnerability that could allow third-party content (such as campaigns downloaded from the add-on server) to execute arbitrary code with user account privileges. See <https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13048> for details. All content currently on the official add-on server has been inspected to confirm that none of it exploits this vulnerability, and the add-on server itself has been patched to ensure that exploits can no longer be uploaded. Therefore, users of previous versions of Battle for Wesnoth who have received user-made content through the official add-on server and no other distribution channel need not fear that their system has been compromised.

CVE-2009-0367 has been assigned to this vulnerability and may provide further information.

\*\*\*

Of course there is also the [full changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.5.11/changelog?rev=33066&view=download) listing (almost) all the changes since 1.5.9. A changelog with changes that might be visible to most users (and only includes these) is the [players changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.5.11/players_changelog?rev=33066&view=download).

The Windows package is available on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.5_branch.29).

The MacOSX package is not available yet. Once it is, you can find it on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.5_branch.29). The package is work in progress and should very soon be available.

The OpenSolaris package is not available yet. Once it is, you can find it on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.5_branch.29).

All known packagers have been contacted. Information about where to get the respective binaries or how to get them work you get on the [Linux binaries site](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/WesnothBinariesLinux) for the Linux binaries. Download links for the other supported systems will be listed at the [downloads page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.5_branch.29) once the binaries are available.

As a fallback you can also get the sources from <http://files.wesnoth.org/> - you should first try to get files through SourceForge to help us save bandwidth. Please get the files from sourceforge.net if possible.

The multiplayer server for 1.5.11 is already up and running. This server can be used to play with any 1.6beta version. If you do encounter problems, please [report them](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/ReportingBugs).

If you find any bugs don't hesitate to report them, but please read the instructions on how to post bugs first. Instructions for bug reporting can be found at <http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/ReportingBugs>.

Enjoy!

PS: **Within the next seven days anyone asking when the binary for xyz will be ready will be banned and the post will be deleted.** Such questions just distract the developers and packagers and don't do any good, so better not ask them...

Bugreports in the forums tend to get forgotten. You will get better results by following the [guidelines](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/ReportingBugs) and report them in the [bugtracker](http://bugs.wesnoth.org).

Sorry for the delay with the Mac binary. I was busy yesterday, and then today my internet went out for a while when I was uploading, and then I was next door when it finished, so I couldn't add it to the release. Anyway, it's on the downloads page now.

After the release a windows-specific bug causing disconnects when connecting to addon server was discovered. I've uploaded updated binary with the commit that introduced the bug reverted:

A trifle:

the background of the main menu does not change any more... it is always the former BG, the WorldMap.

Could it be due to this recent change?

According to [r32976](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth?view=rev&rev=32976), this is intentional.

Yes. The Portrait Director and the Lead Developer wanted those backgrounds removed. They are still available for UMC and a mainline campaign which uses one of them (Legend of Wesmere), but they won't be used for the 1.6 titlescreen anymore.

Apparently the bug was not so Windows-specific. I've been lazily waiting for days for someone to fix the Mac version, since it also suffers from the remote host disconnected problem.

If I knew enough coding I'd fix it myself, but unfortunately I don't and urgent proposal writing doesn't give me the time to learn...

Thanx
