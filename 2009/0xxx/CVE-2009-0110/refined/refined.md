      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `forumid` parameter in the `read.php` script of RiotPix is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection. The application does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the `forumid` parameter.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as password hashes. The provided exploit code demonstrates how to extract password hashes using a series of blind SQL injection queries.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed through HTTP requests to the `read.php` script, injecting SQL queries into the vulnerable `forumid` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system."
