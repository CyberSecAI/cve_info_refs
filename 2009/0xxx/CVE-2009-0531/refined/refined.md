```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the 'entry' parameter of the view.asp script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The provided exploit demonstrates how to retrieve data from the 'photos' table.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface via the 'entry' parameter in the 'view.asp' script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and inject malicious SQL code into the 'entry' parameter.
