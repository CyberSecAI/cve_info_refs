Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-0081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue is improper input validation within the Windows kernel's Graphics Device Interface (GDI) component. Specifically, the kernel does not properly validate input passed from user mode through the GDI component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The Windows kernel fails to adequately validate the input it receives from user-mode processes when processing image files through the GDI. This lack of validation allows for the exploitation of the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel mode.
*   **Complete System Control:** With code execution at the kernel level, an attacker can gain complete control over the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Install malicious programs.
    *   View, modify, or delete sensitive data.
    *   Create new user accounts with full administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by specially crafted Enhanced Metafile (EMF) or Windows Metafile (WMF) image files.
*   **Email Attack:** An attacker could embed the malicious image file in an email and convince the user to preview or open it.
*  **Office Documents:** Embedding malicious EMF/WMF files in an Office document is also an attack vector
*   **Web-Based Attack:** A malicious website could host a page with the crafted image, potentially exploiting users who visit the site. Attackers could also compromise legitimate websites or use websites accepting user-generated content for this attack.
*   **Local System Exploitation:** An attacker who already has local access to the system could also exploit the vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:**
    *   The attacker must create a specially crafted EMF or WMF image.
    *   They need a way to deliver this image to a user and convince them to view it. This could be via an email or by directing a user to a website hosting the image.
*   **Local Attack:**
    *   The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable machine.
    *   They must be able to execute a specially crafted application that exploits the vulnerability.
