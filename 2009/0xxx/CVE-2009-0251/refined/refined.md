    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-0251",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_6b9348db_20250125_023221.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way phosheezy 2.0 handles template editing, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the template.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote command execution vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user input when editing templates."
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user (e.g., apache).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable application's template editing functionality.",
          "The attacker first logs in as administrator using a hardcoded sha1 password found in the application configuration and then edits the layout template.",
          "The attacker then uses a GET request to call the edited template and execute arbitrary commands"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable phosheezy installation and must be able to send HTTP requests. They must also be able to obtain the hardcoded admin password or be logged in as admin.",
        "additional_details": "The exploit code provided retrieves the admin password from a configuration file, logs in to the admin interface, and then injects PHP code into a template. This code then allows the attacker to execute commands via a GET request."
