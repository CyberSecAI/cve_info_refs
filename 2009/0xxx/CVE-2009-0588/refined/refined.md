Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0588:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper authorization checks in the Red Hat Certificate System's Registration Authority (rhpki-ra) component. Specifically, the `op.cgi` script did not properly verify if an agent was authorized to approve or reject a certificate request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The `op.cgi` script lacked proper checks to ensure that only agents belonging to the correct group could approve or reject certificate requests.
- **Bypass of Intended Authorization:**  Agents could bypass intended role/group based access controls.
- **Unrestricted access to approve or reject requests:** Agents from any group could approve or reject certificate requests in the queue for any other agent group if they knew the request ID.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized certificate management:** Agents could approve or reject certificate requests that were not assigned to their agent group.
- **Potential compromise of certificate issuance:** This could allow malicious or unauthorized actors to obtain certificates.
- **Violation of Security Policies:** It breaks the intended separation of duties between different agent groups responsible for various types of certificate requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the Registration Authority component.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers could directly manipulate URLs (specifically, the `op.cgi` script) to perform unauthorized actions.
- **Knowledge of Request IDs:** An attacker needed knowledge or the ability to guess the ID of a certificate request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the RA Interface:** The attacker needs access to the Red Hat Certificate System's Registration Authority interface.
- **Agent Role:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an agent in at least one agent group.
- **Request ID knowledge/ability to guess:** The attacker needs the ID of a request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Robert Mead and reported to Red Hat.
- The fix involved modifying the `op.cgi` script to enforce authorization checks similar to other scripts (`index.cgi` and `read.cgi`).
- The fix ensures that agents can only approve requests assigned to their specific agent group.
- A patch was created and committed to the Dogtag source tree.
- The vulnerability affected both Dogtag Certificate System and Red Hat Certificate System 7.3.
- The issue was resolved in Red Hat Certificate System 7.3 via RHSA-2009:1065.
