Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-0594:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure inclusion of files in `skysilver/login.tpl.php`. Specifically, the `include` statement uses a variable `$theme` and `$TplSuffix` to determine the path of the included file. The attacker controls these variables through the query string.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** An attacker can control the `$TplSuffix` variable, allowing them to include arbitrary files from the local filesystem.
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** An attacker can control the `$theme` variable, potentially including files from remote servers using URLs.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS, though the specific vector provided is in `index.php`, suggesting a separate issue from the file inclusion vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **LFI:**  An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
    *   **RFI:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including malicious PHP files from a remote location. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject client-side scripts into the application, which can be used for various malicious purposes such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **LFI:** By manipulating the `TplSuffix` parameter in the `login.tpl.php` URL.
        *   Example: `http://127.0.0.1/path/skysilver/login.tpl.php?TplSuffix=[lfi]`
    *   **RFI:** By manipulating the `theme` parameter in the `login.tpl.php` URL.
        *   Example: `http://127.0.0.1/path/skysilver/login.tpl.php?theme=[shell.txt?]`
    *   **XSS:** By injecting a script in the `index.php` URL (though this is not directly related to the LFI/RFI vulnerability).
        *   Example: `http://127.0.0.1/path/index.php/>"><ScRiPt>alert('ahmadbady')</ScRiPt>`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   No special privileges are required; anyone with network access to the application can attempt exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit details from exploit-db.com provide more specific details about the vulnerable code and parameters used for the attack than the generic description provided by the CVE.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `login.tpl.php` file, specifically line 1, where the `include` statement is located.
*   The vulnerability is present in phpSkelSite version 1.4.

**Summary**

The content details LFI, RFI and XSS vulnerabilities in phpSkelSite 1.4, where user controlled parameters are used in file inclusion which can allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system or execute arbitrary remote code, and inject client-side scripts to perform malicious actions in the context of the users browser.
