  "CVE-2009-0949": {
    "Description": "A null pointer dereference exists in CUPS. By repeatedly sending maliciously crafted scheduler requests, a remote attacker may be able to deny access to the Printer Sharing service.",
    "Root cause": "A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the CUPS daemon when handling IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED tags due to improper validation of scheduler requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause the CUPS server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The printer sharing service may be unavailable.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending maliciously crafted IPP requests with unsupported tags."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Remote access to the CUPS IPP port is required. No authentication is required.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending IPP requests with multiple unsupported tags. The fix involves ensuring that the name field exists in scheduler/ipp.c. "
