{
  "CVE-2009-0668": {
    "Description": "Arbitrary Python code execution in ZODB ZEO storage servers",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Zope Object Database (ZODB) ZEO network protocol which uses Python pickles to store data. Deserializing data from the database can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization of Python pickles"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary Python code execution on the ZODB ZEO storage server.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network connection to the ZEO server.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to connect to the ZEO server and manipulate database data. This generally implies being an untrusted client with write access to the database."
