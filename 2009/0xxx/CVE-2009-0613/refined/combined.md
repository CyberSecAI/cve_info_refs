How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1. Overview of this critical patch Release
=========================================================================
This critical patch addresses the following issue:
1. Some JSP pages only have session control that allow non-admin
accounts ("Auditor" and "Report Only") the ability to modify
system configurations without getting the proper permission.
1.1 Files Included in This Release
======================================================================

iwss\_config\_database.jsp 1237
2. What's New
========================================================================
After applying this critical patch:
1. The vulnerability issue caused by the lack of permission control
will be resolved. If non-admin accounts Â¡Â°AuditorÂ¡Â± and Â¡Â°Report
OnlyÂ¡Â± try to visit Web pages that should not be accessed,
the requests will be redirected to the summary page.
This critical patch also includes the following fixes, but this fix
list was tested during their release:
1. When IWSS is operating in the reverse proxy mode and the virtual
domain is used for a protected server, the connection to the
protected server fails because IWSS changes the Host header.
IWSS will not modify the host header in the reverse proxy mode.
2. IWSS mistakenly blocks some URL links as ".com" files.
This critical patch addresses this issue by fixing the URL string
name getting method.
3. IWSS cannot correctly handle non-RFC standard traffic that causes
clients to be unable to download attachments from Yahoo mail.

will be resolved.

reports.

reports.
5. Large files that download/upload through the IWSS FTP proxy will be
corrupted.

0MB in the web console.
IWSS will be able to set the access quota policy to 0MB in the

9. After IWSS's transformation, the FTP RETR command missed some
information that makes the FTP server unable to find the file.

HTTP mode.

to IWSS and the file could be successfully downloaded in the FTP over
HTTP mode.
10. Unhandled exceptions in the function "WorkQueue" might cause IWSS
to fail.
IWSS will be able to correctly handle exceptions. Low-fragmentation
heap (LFH) of Windows will be enabled to improve IWSS's memory
performance.

IWSS 3.1 can export policies and configurations from CDT tools
and import to IWSVA 3.1 correctly.
12. In some circumstances, InterScan Web Security Suite (IWSS) can hang
when querying the LDAP Server for common names. This situation causes
IWSS to stop handling HTTP transactions.
IWSS sets a timeout limit for an LDAP query and avoids unnecessary
common-name searches for LDAP users if the "prefer-samaAccount=1"
parameter is configured in the "intscan.ini" file.
13 IWSS misjudges some video/audio file types as "swf" files.
By fixing the file type judgment method, IWSS will correctly
recognize specific audio/video files.
14. Pop-up tips on the summary page of the HTTP/FTP service status are
not correct.

files through ActiveX rule.
18. In the IWSS URL blocking log file and report, when the group
name information for the URL filter is overwritten as a group name
for the WRS filter policy, the user group name of the URL filtering
violations do not display correctly.
The URL filtering policy will not share the same parameter with
the WRS policy and the issue will be addressed.
19. The "about.exe" executable does not have the ability to write a
registry and, therefore, the critical patch for IWSS 3.1 for Windows is
not able to establish a version control.
The "about.exe" executable will add a function to write the
current build version into the registry and, therefore, the critical patch
for IWSS 3.1 for Windows is now able to establish the version
control.
20. If the URL filtering category ID does not exist, IWSS will write
a "null" value in the log page.

space instead of "null" in the log page.

characters will come out.
