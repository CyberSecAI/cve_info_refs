Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability addressed by the Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Suite 3.1 critical patch (build 1237):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission control for specific JSP pages within the InterScan Web Security Suite. Non-admin accounts, specifically "Auditor" and "Report Only" accounts, were able to access and modify system configurations without having the appropriate permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The core issue is a lack of proper authorization checks on certain JSP pages, allowing unauthorized access and modification of configurations by non-admin users.
*   **Inadequate Session Control:** Session management was in place, but it was not restrictive enough to prevent non-admin users from carrying out administrative actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Attackers could potentially modify system configurations through the vulnerable JSP pages. This could lead to various negative consequences, such as:
    *   Disabling security features
    *   Modifying access policies
    *   Compromising the overall security of the system
    *   Disruption of services

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of InterScan Web Security Suite. An attacker would need to log in with an "Auditor" or "Report Only" account.
*   **Direct Access:** After logging in, an attacker could directly access vulnerable JSP pages in the product's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Non-Admin Account:** The attacker would need to have access to a valid "Auditor" or "Report Only" account on the InterScan Web Security Suite.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the InterScan Web Security Suite's web interface.

**Additional Notes from the Patch:**

*   The patch addresses the vulnerability by redirecting non-admin users trying to access the protected JSP pages to a summary page, preventing configuration changes by unauthorized users.
*   The patch also addresses multiple other issues not related to the core vulnerability including:
    *   Incorrect header handling in reverse proxy mode.
    *   Issues with URL blocking.
    *   Problems with non-RFC standard traffic.
    *   Reporting issues.
    *   File corruption during FTP transfers.
    *   UI issues.
    *   Issues with LDAP queries.
    *   SNMP issues.
    *   Log issues.
    *   Display issues.
    *   Data export issues.
    *   Policy update issues.
    *   PE file blocking via ActiveX rule.

**Summary:**

The core vulnerability addressed by the patch is an authorization flaw that allows non-admin users to modify system configurations, leading to potential security compromise. The patch prevents this by adding appropriate checks and access restrictions. It is important to note that this patch addresses a significant security flaw in the Trend Micro product. The document also shows that the patch includes numerous other fixes that while not directly tied to CVE-2009-0613 do demonstrate that this product likely had quality issues around that time.
