The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the "BlogIt!" application, and mentions CVE-2009-0336 as one of the related CVEs, although the primary focus is on other CVEs listed. The following vulnerabilities are described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `day` parameter in the `index.asp` page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `index.asp?view=archive&day=[SQL]`
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `day` parameter, allowing for arbitrary SQL code to be executed.
*   **File Disclosure:** The database file `Blog.mdb` is directly accessible.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to `http://site.com/[Path]/database/Blog.mdb`
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of access control on sensitive files, allowing unauthorized access.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS via the `view` parameter in `index.asp`.
    *  **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to `index.asp?view='+style='background:url(JaVaScRiPt:alert(1369))'+invalidparam='&day=1&month=12&year=2008`.
    *  **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `view` parameter, allowing for execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the entire application and its data.
*   **File Disclosure:** Exposes the database containing sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of input sanitization and validation when building SQL queries from user-supplied data.
*   **File Disclosure:** Lack of proper access control mechanisms, exposing sensitive files directly over the web.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper input sanitization or encoding when rendering user-supplied data in the web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit these vulnerabilities, as the vulnerabilities can be accessed through the public web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

* The content provides specific vulnerable URLs and parameters for each vulnerability, which is more detail than the generic description provided by the CVE.
*   The application is noted to be running on PHP, however the vulnerable code is in ASP, which may be an error in the report.
