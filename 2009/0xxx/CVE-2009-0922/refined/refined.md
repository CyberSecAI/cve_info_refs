    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2009-0922",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Summary": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in PostgreSQL due to improper handling of encoding conversion requests.",
      "Root Cause": "A stack overflow occurs when PostgreSQL attempts to convert localized error messages to a client-specified encoding, and the conversion fails due to mismatched or invalid encoding configurations.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Stack Overflow",
        "Denial of Service"
      ],
       "Impact": "An authenticated user can crash the PostgreSQL server, causing a temporary denial of service.  This impacts other connections and can interrupt transactions.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Network access"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": "An attacker must have valid user credentials to connect and interact with the PostgreSQL server."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
       "Affected Products": [
          "HP Network Node Manager i (NNMi)",
          "openSUSE 10.3-11.1",
          "SLES9-11",
          "Red Hat Enterprise Linux",
          "Debian",
           "postgresql 8.3.6",
            "SLED", "OES",
          "Moodle"
        ],
        "Resolution": "The vulnerability was resolved in PostgreSQL versions 8.3.7, 8.2.13, 8.1.17, 8.0.21, and 7.4.25 by implementing a fix to prevent recursive errors during encoding conversion and improve handling of invalid conversion configurations.  Patches and hotfixes have been made available by vendors."
