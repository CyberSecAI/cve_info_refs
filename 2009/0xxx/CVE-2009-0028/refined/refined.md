Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0028:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `clone()` system call in the Linux kernel allows a child process to specify which signal it will send to its parent upon termination. The vulnerability arises when the `CLONE_PARENT` flag is used with `clone()`. This flag causes the new child process to share the parent of the calling process, allowing it to send its exit signal to the caller's parent, even if the caller and its parent have different UIDs/GIDs. This circumvents the typical signal delivery restrictions, allowing arbitrary signal sending across privilege boundaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect signal handling:** The `clone()` system call does not properly restrict the signal target when the CLONE_PARENT flag is used, allowing a child to send signals to its parent's process rather than its own parent.
*   **Privilege boundary violation:** A child process can send signals to its grandparent, which is a process that could have different privileges (e.g., root).

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could send arbitrary signals to a target process, potentially leading to its termination and causing a DoS.
*   **Unspecified impacts:** The ability to send arbitrary signals to privileged processes with weak signal handling code may have unspecified consequences, including potential exploitation via signal handlers

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local attack:** A malicious program executed by a local unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability to send signals to a privileged parent process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need to have any special privileges; they can exploit the vulnerability as a normal user.
*   **Understanding of the system call interface:** The attacker needs some technical understanding to utilize `clone()` with `CLONE_PARENT` and specific signal options.

**Additional notes:**

*   Some of the provided content mentions that a fix for this vulnerability has been developed and was sent upstream, indicating that a patch exists.
*   Red Hat and Debian security advisories indicate that various Linux distributions have patched this vulnerability in their respective kernels.

The content from the scarybeasts blog, specifically mentions that, a child process can send an arbitrary signal to its parent process, even if the parent has a different real and effective user ID, and this can be used to cause a DoS. A code snippet from the scarybeasts blog demonstrates how a process could send `SIGKILL` to its parent, even if the parent process is owned by the root user and the child is a non-root user, demonstrating a clear privilege escalation vulnerability.
