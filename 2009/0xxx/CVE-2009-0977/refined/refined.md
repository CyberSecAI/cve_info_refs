Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-0977:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located within the `DBMS_AQADM_SYS` package in Oracle Database. Specifically, the `GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsanitized input: The `USER_NAME` parameter passed to the `GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure is directly concatenated into SQL statements without proper sanitization.
- Dynamic SQL execution: The procedure uses `EXECUTE_STMT` to execute dynamically constructed SQL queries, which are vulnerable to injection attacks if user-controlled input is not handled carefully.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `USER_NAME` parameter.
- Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access or modification of data within the database.
- The attacker could potentially escalate privileges or gain control of the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable `GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure of the `DBMS_AQADM_SYS` package.
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely if they can call the vulnerable procedure with malicious input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to call the vulnerable `GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure with a crafted `USER_NAME` parameter.
- This suggests that the attacker needs to have a privilege to execute this procedure, although the specific privileges required are not detailed.

**Affected Systems:**
- Oracle Database versions 9.2.0.8 through 10.2.0.3 are vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content specifies that this vulnerability was addressed in the Oracle CPU April 2009 patch.
- The vulnerable code is in the `GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure which constructs dynamic SQL statements which includes the user supplied `USER_NAME` parameter that is not sanitized.
