```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled data from cookies before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the values of the `BlueEyeCMS_login`, `BlueEyeCMS_pass`, and `BlueEyeCMS_key` cookies are directly inserted into a SQL query without any sanitization or escaping.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to perform unauthorized actions on the database, including reading sensitive data, modifying data, or potentially gaining control of the database server. In this specific exploit, the attacker is able to retrieve the username and password of the user with id 1.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through HTTP cookies. Specifically, the `BlueEyeCMS_login`, `BlueEyeCMS_pass`, and `BlueEyeCMS_key` cookies are vulnerable.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to set the HTTP cookies for the vulnerable application.
