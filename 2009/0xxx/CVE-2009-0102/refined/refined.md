Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Office Project handles memory allocation when opening specially crafted Project files. Specifically, it fails to properly validate memory resource allocations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Memory Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of adequate validation of memory allocations when processing Project files. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious file that can exploit this flaw.
- **Remote Code Execution:**  This vulnerability allows for remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation can give the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete administrative control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially Crafted Project Files:** The primary attack vector is through maliciously crafted Project files (e.g., .mpp files).
- **Email Attachments:** Attackers can send these malicious files as email attachments and trick users into opening them.
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host these files on websites, either directly or through compromised sites, and convince users to download and open them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** Attackers need the technical ability to create specially crafted Project files that can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to employ social engineering tactics to trick users into opening malicious files, whether received as email attachments or downloaded from websites.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any form of authentication from the attacker.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires the user to open a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- Microsoft rated the vulnerability as "Critical" for Project 2000 due to the lack of a prompt before opening files. Newer versions with prompts were rated "Important" due to the added user interaction required.
- The vulnerability was not publicly known or exploited when the security bulletin was originally issued.
- Microsoft credited Bing Liu of Fortinet's FortiGuard Labs for reporting this vulnerability.
