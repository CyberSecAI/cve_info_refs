Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in Novell eDirectory.
- It occurs because the software uses an integer provided in a service request (NDS Verb 0x1) for memory allocation.
- A large integer can cause an integer wrap-around, resulting in the allocation of an insufficient buffer size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of proper input validation and handling of large integers that can lead to an integer wrap around.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The integer wrap causes an insufficient buffer to be allocated and allows the subsequent writing of data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain the same privileges as the eDirectory service.
- **Denial of Service:** Exploitation can also cause the eDirectory service to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered via a network service request (NDS Verb 0x1).
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users querying the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable eDirectory service.
- **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**

- Novell eDirectory 8.7.3.10 ftf1 and prior for all platforms.
- Novell eDirectory 8.8.5 ftf1 and prior for all platforms.

**Patches:**

- eDirectory 8.7.3.10 ftf2 or newer for the 8.7.3.x branch
- eDirectory 8.8.5.2 or newer for the 8.8.x branch
