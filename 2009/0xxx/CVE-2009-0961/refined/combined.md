  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 2.2.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1

  Impact: Interacting with a maliciously crafted website may result in unexpected actions on other sites

  Description: A design issue exists in the same-origin policy mechanism used to limit interactions between websites. This policy allows websites to load pages from third-party websites into a subframe. This frame may be positioned to entice the user to click a particular element within the frame, an attack referred to as "clickjacking". A maliciously crafted website may be able to manipulate a user into taking an unexpected action, such as initiating a purchase. This update addresses the issue through adoption of the industry-standard 'X-Frame-Options' extension header, that allows individual web pages to opt out of being displayed within a subframe.

By enticing a user to visit a maliciously crafted web page, the attacker may overwrite the 'document.implementation' of an embedded or parent document served from a different security zone. This update addresses the issue by ensuring that changes to 'document.implementation' do not affect other documents. Credit to Dean McNamee of Google Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1686

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 2.2.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 2.2.1

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A type conversion issue exists in WebKit's JavaScript exception handling. When an attempt is made to assign the exception to a variable that is declared as a constant, an object is cast to an invalid type, causing memory corruption. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by ensuring that assignment in a const declaration writes to the variable object. Credit to Jesse Ruderman of Mozilla Corporation for reporting this issue.
