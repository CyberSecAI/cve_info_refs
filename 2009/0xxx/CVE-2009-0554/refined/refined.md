        "Information": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing an object that is either uninitialized or has been deleted from memory.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Uninitialized Memory Corruption"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user is an administrator, the attacker could take complete control of the system.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attacker would need to entice a user to visit a specially crafted web page.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted webpage and convince a user to visit it through methods like links in emails or instant messages. An attacker would need to use Internet Explorer 5.01 or 6 or 7. This vulnerability does not affect Internet Explorer 8."
