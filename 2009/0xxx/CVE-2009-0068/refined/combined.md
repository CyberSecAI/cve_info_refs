| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c0)  Manuel Reimer    2009-01-03 05:28:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 21642](attachment.cgi?id=21642 "The mailcap file, as it gets delivered with Slackware 12.2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=21642&action=edit "The mailcap file, as it gets delivered with Slackware 12.2") The mailcap file, as it gets delivered with Slackware 12.2  Hello,  i've attached the /etc/mailcap, Slackware 12.2 ships, by default, below.  Firefox uses mailcap to detect the default application. With the mailcap file, used in Slackware, Firefox uses xdg-open as default application for several "secure" mime types like audio files and PDF files. As xdg-open, itself, detects the "real" mime type (or better asks the desktop manager to detect it) it's possible to execute dangerous files by delivering them with a faked mime-type.  I've created a test page to demonstrate the problem (see URL above). Steps to test:  - Create a new user for the test (to be sure we are on default settings everywhere and to be secure the demonstration program doesn't kill something ;-)). - Log into a KDE session with this user. - Copy the attached mailcap to $HOME/.mailcap - Start firefox - Visit the above URL (you have to add a security exception, as the certificate belongs to mozdev.org), click the link and just hit "OK" to accept the default, selected by firefox.  Result: You'll see a small demonstration program, nested into the .desktop file.  I don't know why the Slackware developers got the idea to use xdg-open in mailcap, but you should add a note somewhere into your documentation (maybe the README file in your source) which warns to not use xdg-open too careless, as it may also execute potentially dangerous files. You should also add a note that xdg-open should not be used in mailcap files, as this may cause security problems if applications expect trusted "viewing applications", there (example: Firefox). ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c1)  Manuel Reimer    2009-01-03 05:55:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 21643](attachment.cgi?id=21643 "Example for a \"SECURITY\" section in the README file.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=21643&action=edit "Example for a \"SECURITY\" section in the README file.") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=19377&attachment=21643) Example for a "SECURITY" section in the README file.  Just a template, as my english isn't very good. Someone should fix my grammar ;-) Maybe this could also be added to a separate file "SECURITY". ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c2)  Ville Skyttä    2009-04-08 10:12:59 UTC  ``` I'm afraid I'm responsible for suggesting this change to Fedora's mailcap file without doing enough homework, and unfortunately it passed others' eyes as well.  My sincere apologies.  But then again, I think there's something pretty disturbing in this picture, running xdg-utils-1.0.2-5.20081121cvs.fc10.noarch on Fedora 10, with KDE 4.2.1:  $ echo -e '#!/bin/sh\necho hello' > foo.sh $ chmod +x foo.sh $ xdg-mime query filetype foo.sh application/x-shellscript $ xdg-mime query default application/x-shellscript kwrite.desktop $ xdg-open foo.sh hello  xdg-open is documented to open "a file or URL in the user's preferred application".  In the above case it didn't, it caused foo.sh to be executed.  And xdg-mime got it wrong as well; my preference order for application/x-shellscript files in KDE file associations is XEmacs, Emacs, then KWrite.  If I remove the executable bits from foo.sh, xdg-open opens it with XEmacs, which is expected.  xdg-mime still shows application/x-shellscript.  FWIW, if I repeat the above otherwise exactly except using foo.png as the filename instead of foo.sh, xdg-open opens it with my configured PNG viewer (gwenview), and xdg-mime says it's image/png and the default is gwenview, no matter whether foo.png is executable or not.  My conclusion of the above is that xdg-open has some "internal" security issues as well (it executed the script despite my preferred app settings), at least in my current setup.  And xdg-mime appears to be confused too in some scenarios (why did it pick kwrite.desktop despite my app preference order?).  Some ideas how to gradually improve things, don't know about feasibility:  1) Fix "xdg-mime query default" or the things it invokes to really return the default app for a file type.  Hmm, I don't know if "default" and "preferred" can be used interchangeably here - but in my case it didn't return the "preferred" app.  If this is expected behavior, it would be good to have it documented.  2) Make xdg-open use the default/preferred app returned by xdg-mime for opening the file.  3) Add e.g. a --check-mimetype="mime/type" option to xdg-open that first verifies whether the thing opened really looks like the given "mime/type" before proceeding with the open, and if not, display a failure message (possibly in a GUI dialog) or asking confirmation whether to proceed (preferably also displaying what app it is about to use for opening the file).  I realize some of these might not really be issues in xdg-{open,mime} per se but the other executables it invokes, but perhaps there's a way to do something about it in xdg-*. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c3)  Ville Skyttä    2009-04-08 13:39:01 UTC  ``` See also <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479010>, e.g. [comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c6). ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c4)  Rex Dieter    2009-09-09 09:33:27 UTC  ``` With kde-4.3 landing, it includes additional restrictions on .desktop file handlind too, which (I believe) covers the original report case.  For [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c2) , take away the chmod +x, and it opens using a text editor (the same behavior as if one clicked it in kde filebrowser).  Are there other cases not yet considered? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=19377#c5)  GitLab Migration User    2019-02-16 13:29:21 UTC  ``` -- GitLab Migration Automatic Message --  This bug has been migrated to freedesktop.org's GitLab instance and has been closed from further activity.

Subject: Fwd: Using xdg-open in /etc/mailcap causes hole in Firefox
 (Demonstration/Exploit included)

Here's a heads up for everyone (I've CCd the discoverer)

Steve, can you assign a CVE id.

Thanks.

----- Forwarded Message -----

Hello,

as I've seen, you also seem to use xdg-open in /etc/mailcap.

The problem is, that xdg-open, itself, detects the right mime-type. This allowes an attacker to deliver a dangerous file with a trustworthy mime-type to get it executed by xdg-open.

I've created an example page:
<https://prefbar.mozdev.org/testxdgopen.html> (With SSL)
<http://prefbar.mozdev.org/testxdgopen.html> (Without SSL)

This page delivers a .desktop file with the mime-type "application/pdf". In default configuration, Firefox offers to open this file with the default application, which is xdg-open. Just one click on "OK" (and most users won't have a closer look at the dialog!) and the content in the .desktop file is immediately executed!

Other combinations are possible, I just got the first result with .desktop files. There may be other dangerous types, Firefox may be tricked to open with xdg-open. It's even possible to hide the real file type.

Problem: Their security bugs are open to the public :-( Fast reaction would be required :-(

Yours
