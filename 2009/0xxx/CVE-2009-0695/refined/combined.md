## ~~More secure~~ As susceptible as PCs

A popular brand of thin client device used by nuclear labs, military contractors and Fortune 100 companies is susceptible to exploits that put entire fleets of the machines in the control of online attackers.

Wyse Technologies, maker of the slimmed-down computing devices, touts them as being as secure, "[or better](http://www.wyse.com/security/xpe_wes_security_policy.asp)" than PCs because there are no hard drives to get corrupted by malware or mechanical failure. It even argues that installing anti-virus software on the devices may be "overkill."

But according to Kevin Finisterre, the founder of security research firm SNOSoft, the devices are shipped with software that is vulnerable to attacks over the internet. Once compromised, the devices can be controlled remotely, allowing an attacker to change their configuration settings and do virtually anything someone sitting physically in front of the machine could do.

"I can take a machine out of the box, plug it in, and it's instantly exploitable," Finisterre, who has written proof-of-concept exploit code, told *The Register*. "There's no interaction on the user's part at all."

What's more, a security bug in Wyse software used to administer the terminals makes it trivial to take over the backend server that runs the program, Finisterre has found. He has written a Ruby proof-of-concept script that exploits the vulnerability in the software, known as the WDM or Wyse Device Manager.

All that's required is that the attacker know the machine's IP address. Once the script runs, it gives the attacker a command shell with full administrative privileges.

Wyse officials say they have reviewed Finisterre's code and so far have been unable to make it remotely execute malicious code in their labs. Still, they acknowledge that the code does cause machines running the Wyse software to crash, and have vowed to fix the bugs that are responsible.

"We take this very, very seriously and we're going to make sure that we completely follow up on what Kevin has reported as well," said Jeff McNaught, chief marketing and strategy officer at Wyse. "It's important for companies like Kevin's to be able to identify ways where we can all improve our products, so we certainly are hats off to him in that regard."

McNaught says he is unaware of any attacks that have targeted the vulnerability.

Finisterre, whose SNOSoft outfit is the research arm of penetration testing firm Netragard, said he developed the code in his bedroom lab over the past couple months using a VMware image with attributes that are almost surely different from those being used by Wyse.

The script targeting the WDM works only when the program is running on Windows 2000 machines. With extra work, he says it would be possible to exploit the bug on machines running Windows Vista or other more recent operating systems, using so-called heap spraying or similar hacking techniques. Running the exploit requires nothing more than providing the IP address of the server that runs the WDM software.

His code targeting the thin clients themselves attacks a small application that acts as a beacon that searchers the attached network for servers running the WDM. It specifically targets the hagent.exe file for terminals running the embedded version of Windows XP, but he said it would be trivial to make the attack work on the agent contained in Linux images because the underlying vulnerability is present on both programs.

Both attacks target buffer overflow errors in code that runs by default on either the Wyse terminals or in the WDM. They are significant, given Wyse's customer portfolio, which according to marketing material includes the [Crocker Nuclear Laboratory](http://www.wyse.com/about/news/pr/2001/1210_UCDavis.asp), the US Marine Corps [Air-Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms](http://www.citrix.com/English/aboutCitrix/caseStudies/caseStudy.asp?storyID=3340) and the [Southern Arizona Veterans Administration Health Care System](http://www.wyse.com/resources/casestudies/pdf/arizonava.pdf). Half of the world's top 100 corporations use Wyse products, according to [this PowerPoint presentation](http://www.citrix-download.com/cvc09/prague/0.4_CVC2009_Prague_Who%20needs%20a%20PC%20these%20days_WYSE.ppt) hosted on the website of Wyse partner Citrix.

Few Wyse brochures get published that don't extol the security superiority of thin clients compared with traditional PCs. Similar boasting is common in cloud computing circles, where marketers would have us believe the risks of buggy code have effectively been eliminated.

But like a [similar case from March](https://www.theregister.com/2009/03/12/cloud_computing_dark_side/), when a coding error by a single software-as-a-service provider exposed numerous customers to potentially crippling attacks, the episode shows that the model at best merely moves vulnerabilities upstream, rather than stamping them out.

For all Wyse's assurances about security, Finisterre said he worked since late May to find an appropriate company employee to contact about the vulnerabilities. Even after seeking help from the US CERT, or Computer Emergency Response Team, he got no reply to any of the emails he sent. Wyse employees answered his queries only after *The Register* asked a company spokeswoman to comment for this article.

"That's a shortcoming on our part," said McNaught, who went on to say the company is taking steps to make sure CERT personnel know the proper way for researchers to notify the company of security bugs. "That conversation has already been started by our CTO." ®

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Wyse Device Manager (WDM) HServer and HAgent contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#654545

Original Release Date: 2009-10-13 | Last Revised: 2009-10-16

---

### Overview

Wyse Device Manager (WDM) Server and HAgent contain several vulnerabilities. An attacker with network access to WDM components could execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.

### Description

| Wyse Device Manager (WDM, formerly known as Wyse Rapport) manages thin clients. Part of the server component (HServer) is implemented as an ISAPI filter on the Microsoft Windows Internet Information Server (IIS) platform. The client component (HAgent) runs as a service on Microsoft Windows systems.  WDM components contain several vulnerabilities:   1. HServer (hserver.dll) User-Agent header stack buffer overflow and 2. HAgent (hagent.exe) heap overflow (both overflows are CVE-2009-0693) 3. HAgent does not authenticate commands (CVE-2009-0695)  The first two issues are implementation defects. The third issue is caused by the lack of adequate cryptographic authentication and authorization. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with network access to WDM components could execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The attacker could also execute unauthenticated management commands on a system running HAgent. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Please see Wyse Security Bulletin [WSB09-01](http://www.wyse.com/serviceandsupport/Wyse%20Security%20Bulletin%20WSB09-01.pdf). |
| --- |

| **Enable HTTPS**Enabling HTTPS provides authentication between Hserver and HAgent nodes. HTTPS authenticates communication from an HServer host to an HAgent host. Depending on key distribution and PKI architecture, HTTPS should prevent an unauthenticated attacker from running management commands on an HAgent host. |
