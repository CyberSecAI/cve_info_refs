Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0292:

**Summary:**

This CVE relates to a SQL injection vulnerability in SHOP-INET v.4, a web application written in PHP. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely to extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `show_cat2.php` script. Specifically, the `grid` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without validation, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which occurs because user-supplied data (`grid` parameter) is not properly handled before being incorporated into a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Disclosure:**  A successful SQL injection attack can lead to the extraction of sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords (which could be hashed but still a security risk if the hashing algorithm is weak).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to `show_cat2.php`. The attacker modifies the `grid` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application, making this a remote vulnerability.
    *   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL syntax and database structure to construct the malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit provided in the Exploit Database content is:
    `target.com/show_cat2.php?grid=-1+union+select+concat_ws(char(58),username,password)+from+admin`
*   This exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the `username` and `password` fields from the `admin` table. The `concat_ws` function is used to concatenate the results with a colon (:) as a separator.
*   The exploit also includes a Google dork: `inurl:show_cat2.php?grid=`, which can be used to identify potentially vulnerable web sites.
*   The identified vulnerable application is SHOP-INET V.4.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from `secunia.com` is just about their vulnerability research services and does not contain any information related to CVE-2009-0292, therefore it is not relevant to the vulnerability analysis.

In summary, CVE-2009-0292 is a SQL injection vulnerability in SHOP-INET v.4 that allows remote attackers to extract sensitive information from the database. The vulnerability is easily exploitable with a crafted HTTP GET request.
