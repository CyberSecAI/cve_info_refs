{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insecure SQL queries within the smNews application's login.php and register.php files. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
     "Authentication bypass due to the ability to inject SQL into the login query.",
    "Column Truncation through re-registering an account"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass authentication and potentially gain administrative access by injecting SQL code.  The attacker can also re-register an existing account, effectively taking it over by setting a new password.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST request to login.php",
    "HTTP POST request to register.php"
    ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the smNews web application. No special positioning is required as the attack is performed through the web interface."
