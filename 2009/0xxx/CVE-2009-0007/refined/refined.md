  "CVE-2009-0007": {
    "description": "A heap buffer overflow exists in QuickTime's handling of jpeg atoms in QuickTime movie files. Viewing a maliciously crafted movie file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
    "vulnerability_details": "The vulnerability is located in the `JPEG_DComponentDispatch()` function when processing JPEG atoms embedded in STSD atoms. Specifically, modifying the image width data within the JPEG atom leads to a heap corruption.",
    "root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow due to improper handling of image width data within JPEG atoms in STSD atoms.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient bounds checking"
      ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the current user or application termination.",
    "attack_vector": "Opening a specially crafted movie file with manipulated JPEG atoms.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to create a malicious movie file. User interaction is required to open the file."
