{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Transparent proxy servers make connection decisions based on HTTP header values instead of source and destination IP addresses.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the transparent proxy server's reliance on the HTTP Host header for connection routing, which can be forged by an attacker.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can make full connections to any website or resource that the proxy server can connect to, including internal resources such as intranet sites not usually exposed to the Internet.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves the attacker forging HTTP Host headers via active content (e.g., Flash, Java) within a web browser. This can be achieved by either convincing a user to visit a web page with malicious content or loading the active content in an otherwise trusted site.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to inject or control active content within a user's web browser, and the user must be behind a vulnerable transparent proxy server."
