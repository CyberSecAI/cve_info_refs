Ver2.00.11 -> Ver2.05.00
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE PLEASE READ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ver.2.05 has some changes on data format, which is not compatible with
older versions.
If you want to go back to the old version for some reasons, you MUST
process "File" > "Folder" > "Combine Attachments" beforehand on each
data folder that contains attachment files (including Sent, Outbox,
Draft, etc.). Otherwise, you can not open attachment files that are
received with Ver.2.05.
For details on the changes, please refer the update history in
"Ver.2.00.10 -> Ver2.05.00"
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE PLEASE READ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Added "Save Attachments to Separate Data Files" ("General Setup" > "Advanced")
option. (Default)
If this option is on, attachment parts in e-mail messages will be
saved as separate data files, which increases overall performance and
decreases the risk of virus-scanning software deleting e-mail messages
that contains viruses along with other innocent e-mail messages.
Those separated attachment files are saved "as is" (not decoded) and
this process is totally transparent from the user.
- There are two commands added in "File" > "Folder" menu. "Separate
Attachments" and "Combine Attachments". Older version of Becky! doesn't
support data files that has separate attachment. So, if you need to go
back to the old version for some reasons, you will need to process
"Combine Attachments" on each folder.
- "Over ? KB message is saved as single file" option is discontinued
because "Save Attachment to Separate Data Files" option does a better
job.
- Auto complete for To, Cc, and Bcc fields is supported. You can turn it
off by unchecking "General Setup" > "Editor" > "Use auto complete for
To, Cc, and Bcc fields." option.
- The result of "Query" is shown as a folder in the tree view. This
temporary folder exists while "Query" dialog is visible.
- Added "Flag" for messages.
You can double click the left side of the e-mail item in the list view
to add "Flag" to the messages. There are some functionalities are
added for flags, like "Prohibit deleting flagged items." in "General
Setup">"Tree/List", and "Select Flagged Messages" in "Edit" menu.
Unlike the priorities or the color labels, flag works on IMAP server.
- "Do not save" option is added to "Delete from Server" action in the
filtering manager. This allows you to set up "Kill" filter for
particular kind of messages you don't even want to see.
If the message meets "Do not save" action, no other actions, except
"Sound", will be processed even if the message matches other
conditions.
- Improved thread capability.
No more "Date" related thread cutting that occurred in the older
versions.
Nevertheless, the performance of thread generation is much more
improved.
Plus, you can connect threads by drag and drop operation.
- "Switch Mailbox" command is added in Compose window.
- "Force to Reconnect" option in "Mailbox Setup" > "Connection", which
enable you to switch dialup connections on "Collection and Delivery".
- There you see small "H" icon in the list view if the messages that received
with Ver.2.05 contain HTML document.
If you process "File" > "Folder" > "Reconstruct Index", you can also see
those small "H"s on the messages that you have received with older
versions.
- "Convert to Plain Text" option is added in "General Setup" > "Message
View" > "HTML View". If you hate HTML messages but you want to read
the content sometimes, this option is for you. (and it is default)
- "Invalidate Executable Tags" option is renamed as "Disallow Scripts".
- Added a resource-requesting callback function to the plug-in
interface. That way you can create plug-ins that replaces icons and
bitmaps in Becky!.
For details, see "\_b2icon\_" sample in Plug-In SDK.
- Supported koi8-r character set.
- Made the filtering manager resizable. If you use Tietew's Powerful
Customizer plug-in, you will see some flickers while resizing but it's
not a bug. Both programs are just working on their way.
- You can use short cut keys on Compose window even if the caret is in
"To", "Subject", etc. fields.
- Disabled "Delete" key when the message view has a focus. You can still
delete messages with other key strokes. (like Ctrl+D)
- Made "Export" command exports hidden messages under the thread.
- Added a command line option "/B" that opens the address book
immediately.
- "Compaction" will not delete "Bcc" fields anymore.
- "Delete" command is added alongside "Cut", "Copy", etc. commands in the
right click menu of the editor.
- If you search addresses in the address book, it will show "Group"
instead of "Comments" in the list.
- Made 4way button repeatable.
- You can customize columns of the list view. "View" > "Customize List
Columns"
- When you are saving an attachment with "Save As" command with the file
name that has no file extension, the appropriate file extension will
be added automatically.
- BUGFIX: You could not add e-mail addresses in the message correctly when
one line contains several e-mail addresses.
- BUGFIX: In the filtering manager, if you specify multiple headers like
"To, Cc, Bcc" and choose "Not Present", the result was not as expected.
- BUGFIX: RFC2231 encoding was not correctly done for some file names
that contain multibytes characters.
- BUGFIX: You could not use ISO-8859-2 character set in the templates.

prevent anti virus software to delete an entire file if virus is found
in Becky!'s bmf file that usually contain multiple files.
- "General Setup" > "Message View" > "Use MSIE component" option is set
off as default due to the recent hazardous virus spreading.
- Made "General Setup" > "Message View" > "Invalidate Executable tags"
option also uses IE's security zone to prevent running scripts.
- Some bugfixes.
Ver2.00.06 -> Ver2.00.07
- BUGFIX: Abnormally terminated when the selected messages contain header
fields that are over 64K bytes. (Since it overruns the buffer only 1
byte, it is unlikely to be the target of Buffer Overflow Attack.)
- Slightly modified the logic for adding Quick Access List. If you
double-click an unread item and do not do any subsequent "reading"
action, such as clicking the view, the item is not added to the Quick
Access List.
- In Quick Access List, items belong to the current mailbox are listed
with a checkmark.
- Made "nntp://"URI clickable
- BUGFIX: Quick Access List was brought up when you hit ESC key to
cancel Search or Dialup.
- BUGFIX: $ regular expression did not work for filtering.

folder.
- etc.
Ver2.00.05 -> Ver2.00.06

that contains extraordinarily long line. (Buffer Overflow security
hole)

- A bit more improved MAPI -- MAPISendDocument, which NetCaptor uses, is
supported.
- BUGFIX: Some word wrapping area was printed twice in "Print" and
"Print Preview" command.
- BUGFIX: In Query dialog, "Before" and "After" (date) meant opposite
when you search in IMAP folder.
- BUGFIX: Abnormally terminated when you open the "What's New" list that
contains messages belongs to the mailbox you have just hidden.
- etc.
Ver2.00.03 -> Ver2.00.04
- Slightly better MAPI support.
Barely good enough to synchronize with Palm. (Choose "Outlook Express"
as a mail client for HotSync).
- Added option to print attachments' file names. "File"-> "Print Setup".
- FIX: Made the "Plug-Ins Setup" menu multiple column if items are
too many.
- FIX: Made it to prevent ![](mailto:) tags in HTML messages
to automatically open the compose windows. (You have to check "Invalidate
execute tags" to deactivate this IE's "feature".)
- FIX: If "From"(or "Reply-To") and "Resent-From"(or "Resent-Reply-To")
indicate a same e-mail address, "Replying to forwarded message" dialog
is suppressed.
- BUGFIX: If you chose to use an original template for forwarding
messages, cited To and Cc fields are truncated at 256 bytes position.

the part of e-mail address. (However, in the form like
"mail@[123.123.123.123]", it is still treated as an e-mail address.)
- BUGFIX: Abnormally terminated when you exit Becky! from the task tray
when some modal dialog box is active.
- BUGFIX: Abnormally terminated when you use global profiles on the
mailboxes that contains both POP3 and IMAP4 profiles.
- BUGFIX: Abnormally terminated when you hide or delete a mailbox that
has active compose window.
- etc.
