{
  "CVE-2009-0148": {
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow exists in Cscope's handling of long file system path names. Using Cscope to process a maliciously crafted source file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling long file system path names.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Processing a maliciously crafted source file with cscope"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide a specially crafted source code file. User needs to process this file using Cscope."
