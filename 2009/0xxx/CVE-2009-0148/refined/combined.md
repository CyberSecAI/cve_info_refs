| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=189666#c0)  Ronald Wahl    2006-04-22 12:23:50 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  cscope's "Find all function definitions" results in "stack smashing" on a valgrind source repository.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  15.5-13.3  How reproducible:  Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Get valgrind (3.1.1 in my case). Extract it. Change into its base directory. 2. Call "cscope -R" 3. Enter an arbitrary char at the "Find all function definitions" and press enter.    Actual results:  cscope reports a "** stack smashing detected ***"  Expected results:  cscope should return all (matching?) function definitions  Additional info:  1. Increasing PATLEN in constants.h to exactly 308 will make the stack smashing message go away but the output of cscope has a strange formating. Increasing the buffer futher will result in correct formating.  2. The overflow fix in cscope-15.5-13.3 seems not related to this.  3. A not very useful coredump:  #0  0x00417402 in __kernel_vsyscall () (gdb) bt #0  0x00417402 in __kernel_vsyscall () #1  0x00ccd159 in *__GI_raise (sig=6)     at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:64 #2  0x00cce6e3 in *__GI_abort () at abort.c:88 #3  0x00d01a1b in __libc_message (do_abort=1,      fmt=0xdbf478 "*** stack smashing detected ***: %s terminated\n")     at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/libc_fatal.c:170 #4  0x00d81e45 in __stack_chk_fail () at stack_chk_fail.c:31 #5  0x080567d5 in findallfcns (dummy=Could not find the frame base for "findallfcns". ) at find.c:451 #6  0x31303938 in ??

()   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=189666#c1)  Neil Horman    2006-05-05 15:27:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 128661](attachment.cgi?id=128661&action=diff "patch to limit how much data putstring copies to the target pointer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=128661&action=edit "patch to limit how much data putstring copies to the target pointer") patch to limit how much data putstring copies to the target pointer  This should fix the problem.  Please test and report results.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=189666#c2)  Ronald Wahl    2006-05-05 22:07:08 UTC  ``` If you fix the putstring prototype in src/global.h too then it works, otherwise it will not compile. The stack smashing went away. Thanks!   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=189666#c3)  Neil Horman    2006-06-23 19:55:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 131459](attachment.cgi?id=131459&action=diff "updated patch to fix header breakage") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=131459&action=edit "updated patch to fix header breakage") updated patch to fix header breakage   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=189666#c4)  Fedora Update System    2006-06-23 21:19:56 UTC  ``` cscope-15.5-13.7 has been pushed for fc5, which should resolve this issue.  If these problems are still present in this version, then please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=189666#c5)  Ronald Wahl    2007-03-03 22:00:20 UTC  ``` I think this issue can be set to fixed. I cannot reproduce it anymore.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Different from both.  CVE-2009-0148 is more of a dupe / re-occurrence /
incomplete fix of even older CVE-2004-2541.  Some vendors originally
addressed that via sprintf -> snprintf across whole sources.  Upstream
instead preferred to use "%.*s" with bit of length math to avoid
overflow and not harm portability.  Though the math could int
underflow, still allowing buffer overflow.

BZ#189666 issue was fixed upstream in 15.6.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=499174#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-05 14:18:32 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer overflow existed in cscope's putstring function in cscope's versions prior to 15.6.  A long function or symbol name in source code file could result in cscope crash or code execution when searching the source code for any function or symbol name.  Issue was originally reported via [bug #189666](show_bug.cgi?id=189666 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - cscope stack smashing"), it can be reproduced using memcheck/tests/match-overrun.c from valgrind source tarball.  In cscope 15.6, putstring was replaced with function fetch_string_from_dbase, which accepts target buffer size as its argument.  Upstream commit: <http://cscope.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cscope/cscope/src/find.c?view=log#rev1.19>  Patch, which was used in Fedora cscope packages and is used in cscope packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5: <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/cscope/devel/cscope-15.5-putstring-overflow.patch>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=499174#c3)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-07 18:02:27 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned the identifier [CVE-2009-1577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1577) to this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=499174#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-15 21:12:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1101 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1101.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=490667#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-17 15:12:32 UTC  ``` Apple Security Team reported multiple buffer overflows in cscope, caused by insecure sprintf usage.  Processing a maliciously crafted source file with cscope may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=490667#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-04 07:37:28 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in 15.7a:   <http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=947983>  Upstream commits: <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=E1LsGx3-00015K-TN%40ddv4jf1.ch3.sourceforge.com&forum_name=cscope-cvs> <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=E1LsGx3-00015C-TN%40ddv4jf1.ch3.sourceforge.com&forum_name=cscope-cvs>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=490667#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-05 14:38:11 UTC  ``` This CVE is duplicate / re-occurrence of old issue CVE-2004-2541:  Buffer overflow in Cscope 15.5, and possibly multiple overflows, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a C file with a long #include line that is later browsed by the target.  It seems the original issue was not completely fixed upstream previously.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=490667#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-06 09:11:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 342619](attachment.cgi?id=342619&action=diff "Original Debian patch for CVE-2004-2541") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=342619&action=edit "Original Debian patch for CVE-2004-2541") Original Debian patch for [CVE-2004-2541](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2004-2541)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=490667#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-15 21:10:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1102 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1102.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=490667#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-15 21:12:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1101 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1101.html>   ``` |  |

# Cscope: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200905-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Cscope might allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/cscope** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **15.7a** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **15.7a** |

### Background

Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code.

### Description

James Peach of Apple discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in
cscope's handling of long file system paths (CVE-2009-0148). Multiple
stack-based buffer overflows were reported in the putstring function
when processing an overly long function name or symbol in a source code
file (CVE-2009-1577).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
source file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Cscope users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/cscope-15.7a"
```

Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-0148
Debian Bug     : 528510

Matt Murphy discovered that cscope, a source code browsing tool, does not
verify the length of file names sourced in include statements, which may
potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially
crafted source code files.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 15.6-6+lenny1.

Due to a technical limitation in the Debian archive management scripts
the update for the old stable distribution (etch) cannot be released
synchronously. It will be fixed in version 15.6-2+etch1 soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cscope package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.
