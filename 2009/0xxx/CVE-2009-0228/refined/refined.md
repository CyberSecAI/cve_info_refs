{
  "CVE-2009-0228": {
    "Root cause": "The Windows Print Spooler contains a buffer overflow due to the improper parsing of certain printing data structures.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Specially crafted RPC request to an affected system. The attacker needs to set up a malicious print server that can be accessed by an affected system.",
      "Network"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Unauthenticated remote attacker.",
       "Ability to set up a malicious print server accessible by affected system.",
        "Ability to send a specially crafted RPC request."
    ],
       "More details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the ShareName on the attacker's print server during enumeration."
  },
  "CVE-2009-0229": {
    "Root cause": "The Windows Printing Service does not properly check the files that can be included with separator pages.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read or print any file on the system. The attacker would not have the ability to change the contents of a file.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Locally logged-on user with valid credentials.",
       "Creation of a specially crafted separator page that includes any file from the system."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Local, authenticated user with the \"Manage Printer\" privilege. On Windows Vista/Server 2008, this is automatically granted to local users who install a local printer."
    ],
     "More details": "The attacker needs the \"Manage Printer\" privilege to exploit this issue. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the local user is automatically given this permission if they install a local printer. This can be accomplished without administrative privileges if the printer driver is included by default."
  },
  "CVE-2009-0230": {
    "Root cause": "The Windows Print Spooler does not properly validate the paths from which a DLL may be loaded.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Elevation of Privilege"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "The attacker needs to store a malicious DLL in a location that is accessible by the print spooler.",
      "The attacker would then create a specially crafted RPC message and send the message to an affected system.",
       "Network",
      "Remote"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Authenticated user (if Guest account is enabled, guest users can also trigger vulnerability).",
        "The \"Manage Printer\" privilege is needed to exploit this issue. On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the local user is automatically given this permission when installing a local printer.",
        "Ability to store a malicious DLL in an accessible location",
        "Ability to create and send a specially crafted RPC message"
    ],
    "More details": "The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted RPC message causes the print spooler to load the malicious DLL and execute code with elevated privileges."
