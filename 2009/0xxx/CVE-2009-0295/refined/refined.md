Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0295

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection issue present in ITLPoll version 2.7 Stable2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not display the results of the SQL query, making exploitation more complex. An attacker needs to infer the output through application behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can extract sensitive data from the database. In this case, the provided exploit attempts to retrieve usernames or passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to `index.php` with a malicious `id` parameter containing the SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable ITLPoll installation and should be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the attack payload.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the path to the ITLPoll installation and a valid poll number to start the injection.

**Additional details from the exploit code:**
- The provided PHP exploit uses a brute-force approach to extract data character by character.
- It constructs a SQL query with a `MID()` and `ORD()` function to extract the value from the database character by character, checking against a character set.
