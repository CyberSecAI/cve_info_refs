Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-0490:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content includes multiple sources (SUSE security report, Gentoo bug tracker, Exploit-DB) explicitly mentioning CVE-2009-0490 in relation to a buffer overflow vulnerability in Audacity.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a boundary error in the `String_parse::get_nonspace_quoted()` function, specifically within the `strparse.cpp` file in Audacity versions prior to 1.3.6.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The function is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow, which occurs when more data is written to a buffer on the stack than it can hold. This can overwrite other data on the stack, leading to crashes or potential remote code execution.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **System Compromise:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a user's system being compromised.
   - **Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system.
   - **Application Crash:** The overflow can cause the Audacity application to crash.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious `.gro` File:** The primary attack vector is via a specially crafted `.gro` file that, when imported, triggers the buffer overflow.
   - **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, namely importing a malicious `.gro` file into Audacity.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **File Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious `.gro` file.
   - **Social Engineering:** The attacker would likely need to trick a user into importing the malicious file.

**Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerable function is `String_parse::get_nonspace_quoted()`.
   - The overflow happens when parsing long character sequences in the `.gro` file.
   - The exploit-db perl script demonstrates a simple proof-of-concept: creating a .gro file with 2000 'A' characters which causes the crash when imported into Audacity 1.2.6

**Mitigation:**
   - The vulnerability was fixed in Audacity version 1.3.6 by rewriting the `strparse.cpp` to use std::string rather than char* arrays.

**Additional Information:**

- The SUSE Security Summary Report indicates that the Audacity vulnerability (CVE-2009-0490) affects openSUSE versions 10.3-11.1
- The Gentoo Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability and that the fix was to update to version 1.3.6 or higher.
- The exploit-db entry provides an example perl script to generate a malicious .gro file that will crash older versions of Audacity.

In summary, CVE-2009-0490 represents a stack-based buffer overflow in Audacity's handling of `.gro` files, allowing for potential system compromise or code execution if a user imports a maliciously crafted file. The vulnerability was addressed in Audacity 1.3.6, which used safer string handling techniques in the `String_parse::get_nonspace_quoted()` function.
