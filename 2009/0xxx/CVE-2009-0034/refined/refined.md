Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**CVE-2009-0034** is related to a vulnerability in sudo.

**Content Analysis:**

The content from `www.gratisoft.us` provides valuable information regarding sudo releases and security alerts, specifically mentioning a security issue related to the `env_reset` option in sudoers and time stamp files.

The following vulnerability information can be extracted:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how `sudo` handles the `env_reset` option and timestamp files. Specifically, if `env_reset` is disabled in `sudoers` (which is not the default setting), there is a potential for users to execute unauthorized commands. The timestamp file issue occurs when a user can reset the system clock which can lead to authentication bypass. Additionally there is also an issue where a user can bypass `tty_tickets` constrains.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   Improper handling of the `env_reset` option in the sudoers configuration.
    *   Vulnerabilities in the timestamp file logic, where manipulation of the system clock can allow authentication bypass.
    * Vulnerability in `tty_tickets` implementation that can allow bypass.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   Users can potentially run unauthorized commands as root or other users, if `env_reset` is not properly configured.
    *   Authentication can be bypassed by manipulation of system time, leading to unauthorized access.
    *   Users can bypass `tty_tickets` restrictions.

*  **Attack Vectors**:
    *   Local exploitation by a user with sudo privileges.
    *   Manipulating the system clock.
    * Exploiting a misconfiguration in sudoers.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   Local access to the system.
    * Ability to manipulate system time (for timestamp bypass).
    * User that is granted some access via sudoers configuration.
    *   Knowledge of `sudo` configurations and vulnerabilities

**Additional Notes**
- The `www.gratisoft.us` content provides more specific details than a generic CVE description might. It indicates that the vulnerability related to `env_reset` was addressed in sudo version 1.7.10p8, and time stamp related issues were fixed in 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p7.

**Other Content:**

The remaining content from `bugzilla.novell.com`, `www.mandriva.com`, `www.redhat.com`, `secunia.com` and `www.vupen.com` do not appear to directly contain vulnerability information about CVE-2009-0034. They are mostly websites related to software vendors and security information providers but does not mention this CVE.

**Summary:**

The content from `www.gratisoft.us` provides relevant information for CVE-2009-0034, specifically detailing multiple vulnerabilities in `sudo`, their root causes, impacts, and attack vectors.
