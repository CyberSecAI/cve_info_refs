**Content Classification:**

The provided content includes a security advisory from Avaya which directly references CVE-2009-0926, indicating a relationship.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the UFS (Unix File System) implementation in Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris, specifically related to the `ufs_getpage()` and `ufs_putpage()` routines.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from how these routines handle memory mapping and page management within the file system. Specifically, the interaction between ufs_getpage and ufs_putpage can lead to an issue with a page being freed twice.
*   **Impact:** A local user could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a system hang or kernel panic, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local; the attacker needs to have a user account on the affected system.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** A local user with the ability to trigger the vulnerable routines through file system operations is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also references two other related CVEs: CVE-2009-0924 and CVE-2009-0925. All three stem from the same general problem in the UFS file system.
*   The Avaya advisory notes that Avaya CMS on SPARC Enterprise T5220 systems are affected, recommending the installation of the latest Solaris patches.
*   The provided content from Flexera describes the Secunia Research team, however does not provide additional details specific to this vulnerability.

**Summary of Vulnerability Information:**

The vulnerability, CVE-2009-0926, is a double-free vulnerability in the UFS filesystem of Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris related to the ufs_getpage and ufs_putpage routines. A local attacker can trigger this vulnerability, causing a system crash or denial of service.
