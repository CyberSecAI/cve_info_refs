{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses unsanitized user input in a SQL query. Specifically, the 'id' parameter from the GET request is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive data, bypass authentication, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious 'id' parameter within a GET request to the 'paises.php' file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required."
