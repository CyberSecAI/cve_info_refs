Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The Wyse Device Manager (WDM) HServer component has a stack buffer overflow in the processing of the User-Agent header.
*   The WDM HAgent component has a heap overflow.
*   The HAgent component does not properly authenticate commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack buffer overflow:** In the HServer component (hserver.dll), a stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists when handling the User-Agent header. This could allow an attacker to overwrite data on the stack, potentially leading to code execution.
*   **Heap overflow:**  The HAgent component (hagent.exe) contains a heap overflow vulnerability. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Missing authentication:** The HAgent component does not properly authenticate management commands, allowing an attacker to execute these commands without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation of either the stack or heap overflow vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **Remote control:** An attacker could gain remote control over the Wyse thin client device.
*   **Unauthenticated commands:** The attacker can execute unauthenticated management commands on systems running HAgent

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the WDM components (HServer and HAgent).
*   **User-Agent header:** For the HServer stack buffer overflow, the attacker would send a malformed User-Agent header.
*   **Hagent exploitation:**  The heap overflow in hagent.exe is exploited directly via network communication.
*   **Unauthenticated command execution:** Attackers send unauthenticated management commands to HAgent.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the WDM server and/or the thin client devices.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable components:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable HServer and HAgent components.
*   **Ability to craft network requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific network requests that trigger the vulnerabilities (overflows or send commands to HAgent)

**Additional Information:**
*   The article from theregister.co.uk provides more context and details about the vulnerabilities and the affected Wyse products. It mentions that the vulnerabilities could be exploited with no user interaction, just by plugging in the device to the network. It also highlights the potential impact on organizations that use Wyse thin clients, including government and military.
*   The CERT Vulnerability Note provides more specifics on the affected components (HServer and HAgent), the nature of the vulnerabilities (stack and heap overflows, and missing authentication), the impact, and a link to the vendor's security bulletin (WSB09-01).
* The vulnerability was discovered by Kevin Finisterre of Netragard/SNOsoft.
* Wyse acknowledged the vulnerabilities and worked on fixes.
*  The article also mentions that the vendor did not initially respond to vulnerability reports, and that they only engaged after the issue was reported by The Register.
