{
  "CVE-2009-0255": {
    "description": "The TYPO3-wide used encryption key is generated with an insufficiently random seed resulting in low entropy which makes it easier for attackers to crack this key.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficiently random seed used to generate the encryption key.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure Randomness"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could crack the encryption key.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability exists in the key generation process within the TYPO3 install tool.",
      "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are described beyond the ability to analyze or exploit the weakness in the encryption key."
  },
  "CVE-2009-0256": {
    "description": "TYPO3 is not invalidating a supplied session on authentication which allows an attacker to take over a victims session via a session fixation attack.",
    "root_cause": "TYPO3 does not invalidate existing session identifiers upon user authentication.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
      "Broken Authentication and Session Management",
       "Session fixation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can hijack a victim's session.",
    "attack_vectors": "Session fixation is possible due to the lack of session invalidation upon authentication.",
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to set a session identifier for the victim to then use to login into the application"

  "CVE-2009-0257": {
    "description": "Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via various arguments and user-supplied strings used in the indexed search system extension, adodb extension test scripts or the workspace module.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in various components.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML.",
      "attack_vectors": "Vulnerable components include the indexed search system extension, adodb extension test scripts, and the workspace module.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply user input into the vulnerable components (e.g. indexed files, test scripts input fields)"
  },
  "CVE-2009-0258": {
    "description": "A remote command injection vulnerability in the indexed search system extension which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file name which is passed unescaped to various system tools that extract file content for the indexing.",
    "root_cause": "Unsanitized file names passed to command-line indexer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote Command Execution"
