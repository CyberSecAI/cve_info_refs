  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the 'school' parameter in the login.php script, which is then used in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive data, specifically user passwords from the 'users' table.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects SQL code through the 'school' GET parameter in the login.php script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server. They do not require any special privileges and can be remote."
