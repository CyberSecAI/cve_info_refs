  "CVE-2009-0033": {
    "Description": "If Tomcat receives a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP connector, it does not return an error and instead closes the AJP connection. In case this connector is member of a mod_jk load balancing worker, this member will be put into an error state and will be blocked from use for approximately one minute. Thus the behavior can be used for a denial of service attack using a carefully crafted request.",
    "Root cause": "Tomcat does not return an error when receiving a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP connector, and closes the AJP connection instead.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling of invalid headers",
      "Lack of proper validation of incoming request headers"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending crafted requests with invalid headers to a Tomcat server, leading to load balancing workers being blocked for a period of time.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Send a crafted request with invalid headers via the Java AJP connector to the Tomcat server"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server with the AJP connector and manipulate the request headers to contain invalid data.",
     "Additional Information": [
       "The vulnerability exists when a Tomcat server is configured with the AJP connector and is also being used in a mod_jk load balanced environment.",
       "The AJP connector is used for communication between web servers (like Apache) and application servers (like Tomcat).",
        "The fix involves ensuring that the correct 400 error is sent back to the browser like other connectors, preventing the AJP connection from simply closing.",
        "The AJP connector is an optimized connector used for communication between web servers and application servers."
