Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2009-0930:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the IMP (Internet Messaging Program) webmail client. Specifically, unescaped output in several scripts allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unsanitized Output:** The core issue is that the application fails to properly sanitize or escape user input before displaying it on web pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed by the victim's browser.
*   **Multiple Vectors:** The vulnerability is present across several scripts within IMP, including `message.php`, `pgp.php`, and `smime.php`, indicating a widespread lack of output escaping practices.
* **IMAP User Field XSS:** An additional XSS vulnerability exists via the user field in an IMAP session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code, attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Exploiting the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or alter the content displayed to the user.
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially compromise a user's webmail account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Injected Code:** The primary attack vector is the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code into user-supplied input fields that are later displayed by the web application.
*  **IMAP Session:** The user field within an IMAP session can be exploited for XSS attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Web Application Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable IMP webmail interface.
*   **Malicious Input:** They need to be able to craft malicious HTML or Javascript payloads that can be injected through user input fields or via the IMAP user field.

**Additional Details**
*  The vulnerability is fixed in IMP versions 4.3.3, 4.2.2, and 4.1.6.
*  The issue was discovered by Gunnar Wrobel during a code audit.
*  This issue was addressed as part of a security release that also included fixes for other vulnerabilities
