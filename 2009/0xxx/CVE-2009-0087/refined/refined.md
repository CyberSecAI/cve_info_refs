Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-0087:

**Vulnerability:** WordPad and Office Text Converter Memory Corruption

**Root Cause:** A memory corruption vulnerability exists in how WordPad and Microsoft Office text converters process specially crafted Word 6 files containing malformed data. The vulnerability lies in the way the Word 6 converter parses these documents.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Improper handling of malformed data in Word 6 files
*   Memory corruption during the parsing process in affected text converters

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the current user.
*   **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Word 6 file to the user and convinces them to open it.
*   **Web-based:** An attacker hosts a website with a malicious document designed to exploit the vulnerability. Users would need to be tricked into visiting this website.
*   Compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content could also host malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to create a specially crafted Word 6 file containing malformed data.
*   Ability to deliver the malicious file to the victim, either via email or by hosting it on a website.
*   The user must open the malicious file using an affected version of WordPad or Microsoft Office Word.

**Additional Details:**
*   The Word 6 converter is not enabled by default on supported versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, reducing the risk on those systems unless it was manually enabled. Windows 2000 systems are more at risk by default, unless the MS04-041 update has been applied.
*   The vulnerability is publicly disclosed.
*   Exploit code that may cause a Denial of Service condition in WordPad has been publicly published. Microsoft is not aware of publicly available exploit code leading to remote code execution
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing WordPad from opening Word 6.0 and Windows Write files, in addition to modifying how Microsoft Word and Office text converters handle these files.

**Mitigations/Workarounds (Prior to Patch):**
*   Avoid opening or saving Microsoft Office, RTF, or Write files from untrusted or unexpected sources with affected software.
*   Disable the Word 6 converter by restricting access to the converter files using access control lists.
