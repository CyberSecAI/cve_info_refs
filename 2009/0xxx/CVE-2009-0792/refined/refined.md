  "CVE-2009-0792": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflows and multiple insufficient upper-bounds checks on certain variable sizes were originally discovered in the Ghostscript's International Color Consortium Format Library (icclib). Using specially-crafted ICC profiles, an attacker could create a malicious PostScript or PDF file with embedded images that could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened.  A missing boundary check was also found in Ghostscript's CCITTFax decoding filter. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PostScript or PDF file that could cause Ghostscript to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code when opened.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflows and insufficient upper-bounds checks in Ghostscript's ICC library and a missing boundary check in CCITTFax decoding filter.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow in the ICC library",
      "Missing boundary check in the CCITTFax decoding filter"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause Ghostscript to crash, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS), or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted PostScript file",
      "Specially crafted PDF file"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create specially crafted PostScript or PDF files. The attacker needs to entice a user to open the crafted file with a vulnerable version of Ghostscript. An attacker would have the same privileges as the user opening the crafted file."
