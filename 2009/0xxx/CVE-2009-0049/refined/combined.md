1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dhcp
By sending requests with a large value for 'dhcp-max-message-size'
dhcp-clients could crash dhcpd if dhcpd was configured with a large
amount of DHCP options (CVE-2007-0062).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ntp/xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
Packages for SLES10 got delayed due a fix for another problem and
will follow soon
- squid
A denial of service condition in HTTP-request processing
was fixed in squid (CVE-2009-0478).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- wireshark
wireshark could crash while reading capture files containing
NetScreen data (CVE-2009-0599), while reading Tektronix K12 capture
files (CVE-2009-0600) or if the HOME environment variable contained
format string specifiers (CVE-2009-0601).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libpng
Specially crafted png files could crash applications using libpng or
potentially execute arbitrary code by causing free of an
uninitialized pointer (CVE-2009-0040).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- pam\_mount
Temporary file handling of the passwdehd script was prone to symlink
attacks (CVE-2008-5138). In 11.0 and 11.1 the script was removed as
it doesn't work on those distributions anyways.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- enscript
long path names could overflow a buffer in enscript (CVE-2008-5078).
Affected Products: SLES9
- eID-belgium
eID-belgium didn't properly check the return value of the openssl
function EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0049).
Affected Products: SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-good
Specially crafted QuickTime media files could cause heap based
buffer overflows in gstreamer. Attackers could potentially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0386, CVE-2009-0387,
CVE-2009-0397).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

**oCERT-2008-016 multiple OpenSSL signature verification API misuse**

**Description**:

Several functions inside the [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org)
library incorrectly check the result after calling the EVP\_VerifyFinal function.

This bug allows a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature
rather than as an error. This issue affects the signature checks on DSA and
ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS.

The flaw may be exploited by a malicious server or a man-in-the-middle
attack that presents a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to
a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

A patch fixing the issue with proper return code checking and further
important recommendations are described in the original OpenSSL Team
advisory.

At the request of the OpenSSL team, oCERT has aided in the remediation
coordination for other projects with similar API misuse vulnerabilities.
In addition to EVP\_VerifyFinal, the return codes from DSA\_verify and
DSA\_do\_verify functions were being incorrectly validated, and packages
doing so are affected in a similar fashion as OpenSSL.

**Affected version**:

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) <= 0.9.8i [1]

The following packages were identified as affected by the same OpenSSL
vulnerability, as they use OpenSSL EVP\_VerifyFinal function and incorrectly
check the return code.

[NTP](http://www.ntp.org) <= 4.2.4p5 (production), <= 4.2.5p150 (development)

[Sun GridEngine](http://gridengine.sunsource.net) <= 5.3

[Gale](http://www.gale.org) <= 0.99

[OpenEvidence](http://www.openevidence.org) <= 1.0.6

[Belgian eID middleware - eidlib](http://eid.belgium.be) <= 2.6.0 [2]

Freedom Network Server <= 2.x

The following packages were identified as affected by a vulnerability
similar to the OpenSSL one, as they use OpenSSL DSA\_verify and/or DSA\_do\_verify function and
incorrectly check the return code.

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) <= 9.4.3

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) 9.0 (all versions), 9.1 (all versions), >= 9.3.0 & <= 9.3.6, >= 9.4.0 & <= 9.4.3, 9.5.0, 9.5.1, 9.6.0

[Lasso](http://lasso.entrouvert.org) <= 2.2.1

[ZXID](http://www.zxid.org) <= 0.29

1 - use of OpenSSL as an SSL/TLS client when connecting to a server
whose certificate uses an RSA key is **NOT** affected. Verification of
client certificates by OpenSSL servers for any key type is **NOT**
affected.

2 - Belgian eID middleware latest versions are not available in source
form, therefore we cannot confirm if they are affected

**Fixed version**:

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) >= 0.9.8j

[NTP](http://www.ntp.org) >= 4.2.4p6 (production), >= 4.2.5p153 (development)

[Sun GridEngine](http://gridengine.sunsource.net) >= 6.0

[Gale](http://www.gale.org), N/A

[OpenEvidence](http://www.openevidence.org), N/A

[Belgian eID middleware - eidlib](http://eid.belgium.be), N/A

Freedom Network Server, N/A

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) >= 9.3.6-P1, >= 9.4.3-P1, >= 9.5.1-P1, >= 9.6.0-P1

[Lasso](http://lasso.entrouvert.org) >= 2.2.2

[ZXID](http://www.zxid.org), N/A

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
