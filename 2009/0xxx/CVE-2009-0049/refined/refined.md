Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0049:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of return values from the `EVP_VerifyFinal` function within OpenSSL. This function is used for signature verification.
- Specifically, the affected software failed to properly check if `EVP_VerifyFinal` succeeded or failed, leading to malformed signatures being incorrectly accepted as valid.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper return code validation of the `EVP_VerifyFinal` function in OpenSSL.
- This leads to the acceptance of invalid cryptographic signatures as valid.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A malicious actor could potentially bypass signature verification checks.
- In the context of TLS/SSL, this could allow a malicious server or man-in-the-middle attacker to present a forged certificate chain to a vulnerable client.
- This could lead to the client establishing a connection with a malicious server, potentially enabling further attacks like data interception or injection.

**Attack vectors:**

- Man-in-the-middle attacks: An attacker could intercept network traffic between a client and a legitimate server, replacing the server's legitimate certificate chain with a malicious one containing a malformed signature.
- Malicious servers: A malicious server could present a certificate with an invalid signature to a vulnerable client during the TLS/SSL handshake.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic (man-in-the-middle) or control a server that the vulnerable client is attempting to connect to.
- The attacker also needs the ability to craft a certificate chain with a malformed signature that exploits the vulnerable verification process.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is not specific to a single product, but rather a common flaw in how multiple software products were using the OpenSSL library.
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was identified through research by Google Security Team, and oCERT aided in coordinating remediation for affected projects beyond OpenSSL itself.
- The issue was not limited to `EVP_VerifyFinal`; some software also exhibited similar incorrect validation with `DSA_verify` and `DSA_do_verify` functions.
- The document also clarifies that the vulnerability does not affect OpenSSL when used as an SSL/TLS client connecting to a server using RSA keys.
- The affected software mentioned include eID-belgium, NTP, Sun Grid Engine, Gale, OpenEvidence, BIND, Lasso, and ZXID

The SUSE security advisory confirms that the eID-belgium package is vulnerable to CVE-2009-0049, due to improper validation of the `EVP_VerifyFinal` function return value.
