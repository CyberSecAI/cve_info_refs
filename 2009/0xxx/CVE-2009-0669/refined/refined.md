Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-0669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the Zope Object Database (ZODB) Zope Enterprise Objects (ZEO) network protocol. Specifically, it's an authentication bypass issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core vulnerability is that the ZEO network protocol has a flaw that allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The vulnerability allows untrusted clients to connect to the ZEO servers. While not stated explicitly, a successful bypass could allow unauthorized access to data or other server functionalities if further weaknesses or misconfigurations are present. 
*   The advisory explicitly states that "it is very important that only trusted clients be allowed to write to ZODB databases" because loading data from the database can cause arbitrary code to be executed as part of object deserialization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. Specifically, an attacker must be able to make network connections to a ZEO server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an untrusted client able to connect to the ZEO server. This implies network accessibility to the ZEO service.
*   No specialized tools or exploits are mentioned, suggesting the vulnerability might be exploitable through direct interaction with the ZEO protocol.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in ZODB 3.2 (Zope 2.7).
*   The vulnerability is only exploitable if you are using ZEO to share a database among multiple applications or application instances and if untrusted clients can connect to your ZEO servers.
*   The fix is included in ZODB 3.8.2 or ZODB 3.9.0b5, and in Zope versions 2.10.9, 2.11.4, 2.8.11, 2.9.11, 3.1.1, 3.2.4, 3.3.3 and 3.4.1.
*   The advisory also mentions CVE-2009-0668 which allows arbitrary Python code execution, this vulnerability was introduced in ZODB 3.3 (Zope 2.8).
