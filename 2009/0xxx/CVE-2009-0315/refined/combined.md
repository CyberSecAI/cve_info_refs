| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 11:40:44 UTC  ``` Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Python module of xchat allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to an erroneous setting of sys.path by the PySys_SetArgv function.  References (test case, PoC): <http://www.nabble.com/Bug-484305%3A-bicyclerepair%3A-bike.vim-imports-untrusted-python-files-from-cwd-td18848099.html>  Proposed patch: The Debian patch for similar dia's Python related issue, available at:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;filename=pythonpath.diff;att=1;bug=504251>  should be sufficient to resolve this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 11:42:58 UTC  ``` This issue does NOT affect the version of the xchat package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  This issue affects the versions of the xchat package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  Comment relevant to fixes for RHEL-{3,4,5}:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.  More information regarding issue severity can be found here: <http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 11:43:42 UTC  ``` This issue affects all versions of the xchat package, as shipped  with Fedora releases of 9, 10 and devel.  Please fix.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-28 10:45:07 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-0315](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0315) the following vulnerability:  Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Python module in xchat allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to a vulnerability in the PySys_SetArgv function ([CVE-2008-5983](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5983)).

Ray Strode's test case to check the work of the fix can be found here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8](show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-0314 gedit: untrusted python modules search path")   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c8)  Petr Šplíchal    2009-04-28 09:46:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 341543](attachment.cgi?id=341543 "reproducer: dummy xchat module") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=341543&action=edit "reproducer: dummy xchat module") reproducer: dummy xchat module   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c9)  Petr Šplíchal    2009-04-28 09:47:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 341544](attachment.cgi?id=341544 "reproducer: trojan gtk module") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=341544&action=edit "reproducer: trojan gtk module") reproducer: trojan gtk module   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c10)  Petr Šplíchal    2009-04-28 09:54:54 UTC  ``` The issue is reproducible on RHEL-{4,5}. On RHEL-3 it seems it's not vulnerable. Steps to reproduce:  1. mkdir /tmp/trojan 2. download both reproducers to the directory above 3. cd /tmp/trojan 4. xchat 5. menu window -> plugins -> load -> dummy.py 6. i'm trojan will appear in xchat windows if vulnerable  Note: xchat is not vulnerable when the plugin is placed into ~/.xchat2 and loaded automatically upon xchat startup, the vulnerability appears only when the plugin is added manually.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c11)  Josh Bressers    2010-05-19 20:27:04 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect xchat for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.  This issue does affect xchat for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=481560#c12)  Vincent Danen    2015-08-22 03:28:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany,
	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Hello Steve,

  initially CVE-2008-4863 has been assigned for the Blender's
untrusted search path issue.

Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the
beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python
maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need
of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading
Python modules.

Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in
the following packages:

Thanks, Jan.
