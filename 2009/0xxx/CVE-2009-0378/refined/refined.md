The XSS vulnerability could allow the attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, possibly leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": {
     "SQL Injection": "The SQL injection vulnerability is triggered via the 'mpid' parameter in the URL.",
     "XSS": "The XSS vulnerability is triggered via the 'pet' parameter in the URL."
