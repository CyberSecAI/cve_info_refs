```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple instances of unsanitized user-supplied input are used in various parts of the TYPO3 system.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the indexed search system extension, adodb extension test scripts, and the workspace module.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors:
  -  By injecting malicious code through user-supplied strings via arguments in the indexed search system extension, adodb extension test scripts or the workspace module.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Attackers must be able to supply malicious inputs to the vulnerable components, which are typically exposed to end-users of the TYPO3 CMS.
