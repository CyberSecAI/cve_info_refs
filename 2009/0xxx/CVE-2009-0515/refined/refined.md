Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0515:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `check_lang.php` file of the "Yet Another NOCC" webmail application. Specifically, the `$lang` variable is directly used in a `require()` statement to include a language file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly validate the `$lang` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This is achieved by using path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `$lang` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to exposure of configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
*   Depending on server configurations and the files included, it might even be possible to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to `check_lang.php` with a malicious value for the `lang` parameter.
*   The attacker can manipulate the `lang` parameter, such as `check_lang.php?lang=../[localinclude]%00`, to achieve local file inclusion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No specific authentication is mentioned as a requirement, indicating that the vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in "Yet Another NOCC" version 0.1.0 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on February 9, 2009.
*   The exploit-db page provides a vulnerable code snippet showing the vulnerable part of `check_lang.php` and an example URL.

**Summary:**

CVE-2009-0515 is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in Yet Another NOCC 0.1.0 due to improper sanitization of the `lang` parameter in `check_lang.php`. An attacker can use this vulnerability to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by exploiting the lack of path validation and null byte injection.
