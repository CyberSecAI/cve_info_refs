Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause was a corrupted patch (specifically, `cups-CVE-2008-3640.patch`) that was meant to fix a previous vulnerability (CVE-2008-3640) in CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System). The corrupted patch prevented the fix from being applied correctly on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Patching:** The primary weakness was that the fix for CVE-2008-3640 was not correctly implemented in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 due to the corrupted patch file.
*   **Corrupted Patch File:** The patch file itself was corrupted, with a size smaller than 4 bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The incomplete fix meant that the original vulnerability (CVE-2008-3640) remained exploitable in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3. The specific impact of CVE-2008-3640 is not detailed in this content but it implies a security flaw in CUPS.
*   It should be noted that the content states that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 were not affected by the corrupted patch as they already contained the fix for CVE-2008-3640.

**Attack Vectors:**

* The provided text doesn't describe the specific attack vectors but it suggests an existing vulnerability that can be exploited.
* The attack vector would likely involve exploiting a vulnerability in the CUPS service. The details of the specific vulnerability (CVE-2008-3640) are not included, which makes it difficult to provide further details.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to target and exploit vulnerabilities present within the CUPS service on affected systems. The level of access or position isn't specified within the document.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was identified as a "medium" severity vulnerability.
*   A fix was released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux via RHSA-2009:0308.
*   Avaya systems were not vulnerable by default, as CUPS was not installed on them by default. However, Avaya software-only products may be vulnerable depending on the underlying OS.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2009-0577 was a result of a corrupted patch that was meant to address CVE-2008-3640 in CUPS, leaving Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 vulnerable. This allowed the original vulnerability (CVE-2008-3640) to remain exploitable.
