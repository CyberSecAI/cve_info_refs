How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

### [Building Rich Internet Applications Models: Example of a Better Strategy](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/06/building-rich-internet-applications-models-example-of-a-better-strategy.html)

Crawling “classical” web applications is a problem that has been addressed more than a decode ago. Efficient crawling of web applications that use advanced technologies such as AJAX (called Rich Internet Applications, RIAs) is still an open problem. Crawling is important not only for indexing content, but also for building models of the applications, which is necessary for automated testing, automated security and accessibility assessments and in general for using software engineering tools. This paper presents a new strategy to crawl RIAs. It uses the concept of Model-Based Crawling (MBC) and introduces a new model, the “menu model”, which we show to be much simpler than previous models for MBC and more effective at building models than previously published methods. This method and others are compared against a set of experimental and real RIAs.

The [SSRG](http://ssrg.eecs.uottawa.ca/members.html) research team will present these findings at ICWE 2013, 11 July@16:00, Aalborg, North Denmark.

### [AppScan Enterprise v8.7 performance improvements](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/05/appscan-enterprise-v87-performance-improvements.html)

In March 2013, we released version 8.7 of AppScan. One of
the focus areas for that release was to improve the scalability and performance
of the enterprise components of the solution, specifically the AppScan
Enterprise Server and AppScan Enterprise Dynamic Analysis Scanner. The
Engineering team made some architecture changes, which  helped dramatically improve the performance
and scalability of these components. In this blog entry, I'd like to provide an
overview of these changes and their effect.

First, the Engineering team separated the database tables
for storing information during the execution of a scan from the central AppScan
Enterprise Server database and moved those tables into a local built-in
database on the AppScan Enterprise Dynamic Analysis Scanner (DAST scan server).  In the previous versions of the product, the
scan server wrote data into the AppScan Enterprise Server central database
throughout the entire duration of the scan. This consumed a lot of resources on
the database server which affected the Web UI performance and greatly limited
the number of scans you could run simultaneously on a scan server. There were
also latency concerns depending on where the scan server was located in
relation to the database server. In version 8.7, scan data is written into a
local built-in database on the scan server. Data is transferred to the central
database on the AppScan Enterprise Server only at the end of a scan (in one
batch). This improved the performance of the Web UI, enabled running more
simultaneous scans on a single scan server and addressed the latency concerns
when the scan server is located far from the database server.

Figures 1 and 2 for a depiction of the implemented architecture
changes.

[![1](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0192aa5744f7970d-800wi "1")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0192aa5744f7970d-pi)

[![2](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0191028ed660970c-800wi "2")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0191028ed660970c-pi)

Another implementation change made by the Engineering team
was removing the old encryption mechanism for protecting data
"at-rest".  When deploying
v8.7, we recommend that AppScan Enterprise administrators enable the Microsoft
SQL Server Enterprise Edition (2008 and higher) built-in mechanism for data
encryption, Transparent DATA Encryption (TDE), which provides much better
performance.  Alternatively,
administrators could use Encrypting File System which comes with Windows.

So here are the results of the efforts of the Engineering
team:

* Web UI responsiveness has
  increased by approximately 50%
* Scan and reporting
  performance has increased by approximately 50%
* 4-5 scans can run at the
  same time on single DAST scan server
* DAST scan servers can be
  deployed remotely from central AppScan Enterprise Server

We hope that the improved robustness of these
AppScan components will help enhance your overall experience with the product.

### [Research Awards for Project on Crawling Mobile and Rich Internet Applications](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/01/research-awards-for-project-on-crawling-mobile-and-rich-internet-applications.html)

**2012  IBM CAS Project of the Year:****Efficient and Scalable Mapping of Mobile and Complex Rich Internet
Applications for Automated Security Testing**

The ability
to “crawl” Web sites and Web applications is at the core of the Internet.
Crawling is necessary to indexing, searching and security testing operations.
With the rise of “Rich Internet Applications” (RIA) there is a tremendous gain
in end-user experience, but it is becoming harder to automatically crawl these
Web sites. Another recent evolution in computing is the move to everything
mobile. Mobile applications are bound to replace desktop applications in the
coming years. It is therefore critical to develop crawling tools adapted to
this new paradigm.

The objective of
this research is to provide efficient and scalable crawling techniques that
work on real life RIAs and mobile applications, and does so entirely
automatically. It builds on the results of our previous research, but tackles
the open problem that some RIA are simply too large to be crawled exhaustively.

The project was awarded by
IBM with the "Project of the year 2012" distinction based on the
following criteria:

* Excel as a research center for the
  advancements of applied science in research areas strategic to IBM
* Harvest and transfer results from advanced research to strategic products and
  initiatives
* Build and foster relationships among researchers, IBM and Customers
* Expose IBM developers to current research directions, and identify new and
  emerging technology issues for academic research.

### [Find Security Vulnerabilities in Android Apps](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/12/scan-android-apps.html)

Mobile security can be tested in a variety of ways. You can apply black box testing to test the server side logic that your mobile app is working with, **[as we've recently blogged about](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/have-you-scanned-your-mobile-site-for-vulnerabilities-yet.html)**.

You can also apply static analysis to test the client side. The following short video shows exactly how that's done using IBM Security AppScan Source Edition:

For a more complete overview of mobile security, **[check out the webcast](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/08/the-new-frontier-securing-mobile-apps.html)** we've recently published.

### [Understanding AppScan Test Policies](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/12/understanding-appscan-test-policies.html)

IBM Security Appscan provides automated security scanning of web applications.

Did you know that you can apply **test policies** within IBM Security AppScan to cover particular aspects of the scan? Using the right policy produces optimal scanning results and reduces false positives.

[![Figure-02](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef017c3439d2c0970b-800wi "Figure-02")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef017c3439d2c0970b-pi)

In **[this great article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-appscan/)**, you can get an overview of IBM Security AppScan test policies, and learn which policy is optimal based on the type of application and its stage of development. The article also provides a side-by-side policy comparison that details each scan policy that is offered by the IBM Security AppScan tool.

### [Have you scanned your mobile site for vulnerabilities yet?](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/have-you-scanned-your-mobile-site-for-vulnerabilities-yet.html)

**Mobile sites - Resurrecting security risks**

In today's world any self respecting web site must provide access to its services through a desktop browser **as well as** a mobile device. This basically means that there are **two versions to every site**, one for desktop users and one for mobile users. Are both secure? How do we know for sure?

First, let's take a quick look at some of the reasons why companies would prefer to have mobile users visit a mobile-based site instead of directing them to the original desktop site.

* Technologies - There are certain technologies that are not supported on a mobile device (e.g. Flash on iOS) that would have to be re-designed to meet smartphone requirements.
* User experience - The user experience is completely different. For example, take the hover action, a desktop user can hover over a certain area and have menus sliding this way and that. But on a mobile device hovering does not exist.

### [Top 5 Innovations Transforming Security Scanners](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/top-5-innovations-transforming-security-scanners.html)

*Like the web itself, security scanners are advancing at a fast pace. Here are the top 5 technologies that leading security professionals are applying to stay ahead of the curve:*

**5. XSS Analyzer**

The "classic" black box approach for detecting XSS relies on sending a bulk of tests based on a “cheat sheet” of around a hundred different payloads. This is a reasonable approach for an automated tool, but it isn’t very sophisticated.

Mimicking a human attacker, **[XSS Analyzer](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/07/announcing-xss-analyzer.html)** is a learning system that follows a disciplined step-by-step approach. XSS Analyzer learns the defense patterns of an application, and finds ways to defeat those defenses. This allows XSS Analyzer to find vulnerabilities that could never be found automatically before, with higher accuracy and less time.

### [String Analysis in AppScan/JSA](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/string-analysis-in-appscanjsa.html)

Let's see how **[String Analysis](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/what-is-string-analysis.html)** is used to improve the accuracy of **[JSA](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/06/by-now-you-have-probably-heard-about-jsa-introduced-inappscan-standard80-in-oct-10-jsa-is-a-component-that-does-static-ana.html)**.

Consider the following real-world example:

var str = document.URL;
 var url\_check = str.indexOf('login.html');
 if (url\_check > -1) {
    result = str.substring(0,url\_check);
    result = result + 'login.jsp' + str.substring((url\_check+search\_term.length), str.length);
    document.URL = result;
 }

Any standard **[taint analysis](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~omertrip/pldi09/paper.pdf)** would argue that this code is vulnerable to **[Open Redirect](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect)**, since the value of the untrusted variable "str" flows into the assignment "document.URL = result"; this presumably allows an attacker to control the URL target of a redirect operation, which means that phishing is possible.

However, closer inspection reveals there is no vulnerability here: while part of the target URL can indeed be controlled by an attacker (the request parameters), the *target hostname* of the redirection is beyond the attacker's control.

So what could we do?

### [What is String Analysis? A look at one of AppScan's breakthrough technologies](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/what-is-string-analysis.html)

The best technologies are often the ones that you, as a user, never have to worry about. They work automatically, behind the scenes, making a product or service work better. With nothing to configure, nothing new to learn. They just work.

**String Analysis** is such a technology. If you think of it, it's a thing of beauty. Because String Analysis is actually one of the most complicated analysis technologies that IBM (or anyone) has ever developed in the world of static analysis.

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run a malicious HTML script that could disclose information, forward user data to a third party, or access any data on the affected systems that was accessible to the logged-on user. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce useful information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Windows Search does not properly restrict the environment within which scripts execute.

**What is Windows Search?**

Windows Search allows instant search capabilities for most common file and data types such as e-mail, contacts, calendar appointments, documents, photos, multimedia, and other formats extended by third parties. These capabilities enable consumers and information workers to more efficiently find, manage, and organize the increasing amount of data common in home and enterprise environments. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 940157](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/940157).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run a malicious client-side script. If this malicious script were run, it would run with special permission that would not normally be granted to a script running on an Internet web page. These permissions could allow the disclosure sensitive information, the forwarding of user data to a third party, or access to data on the affected systems that was accessible to the logged-on user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires a specially crafted file to be placed on the system or in an e-mail message in an indexed mail box. If a user performs a search that returns this file as the first result, arbitrary HTML script execution could occur. If the specially crafted file is not the first result, the user would need to select and preview the file in order for the exploit to occur.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses this vulnerability by modifying how Windows Search restricts the environment within which scripts execute.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
