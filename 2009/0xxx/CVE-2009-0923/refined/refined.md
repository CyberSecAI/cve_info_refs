Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0923:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A security vulnerability exists in the Kerberos incremental propagation mechanism.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Kerberos implementation, specifically during the incremental propagation of changes/updates.
- This can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) against slave Key Distribution Center (KDC) systems. This means that the affected KDC servers could become unresponsive, preventing Kerberos authentication and related services.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is related to the mechanism of Kerberos incremental propagation. The specifics on the exact attack method were not detailed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable Kerberos propagation mechanism.
- The necessary privileges for the attacker were not mentioned, but it's likely that some level of access to the Kerberos environment is needed, or at least the ability to send Kerberos related communications.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects Solaris 10 Operating System and OpenSolaris.
- Avaya products that utilize Solaris 10 may also be affected. Avaya CMS R15 was specifically mentioned, noting that while Kerberos is installed on these systems, it is not configured or used by default, and the vulnerability would be addressed by Avaya following its standard procedures.
- Avaya recommends general security practices like using firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) as mitigation steps until a product update is available.
