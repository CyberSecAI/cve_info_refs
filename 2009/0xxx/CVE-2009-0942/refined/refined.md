Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Help Viewer loading Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) referenced in URL parameters without proper validation. Specifically, the Help Viewer does not verify if the referenced style sheets are within a registered help book.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper validation of file paths when loading CSS files in the Help Viewer.
*   **Arbitrary File Loading:** The Help Viewer loads CSS files based on URLs without checking if those URLs point to valid locations within registered help books.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious "help:" URL, an attacker can trick the Help Viewer into loading arbitrary CSS files that include malicious AppleScript. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious "help:" URL:** Attackers can craft malicious "help:" URLs containing references to arbitrary CSS files that contain malicious AppleScript.
*   **User Interaction:** This vulnerability requires a user to access/open a maliciously crafted "help:" URL. This could be achieved by tricking the user into clicking on a link in an email, visiting a malicious website, etc.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the capability to create malicious "help:" URLs containing references to external CSS files.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attacker needs to trick the victim to open such a malicous URL.
*   **Ability to Host Malicious CSS/AppleScript:** The attacker must host the malicious CSS file, which contains malicious AppleScript code, to be loaded by the Help Viewer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Mac OS X versions 10.4.11, 10.5 through 10.5.6, and their server counterparts.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by improved validation of file system paths when loading style sheets in the Help Viewer.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Brian Mastenbrook.
