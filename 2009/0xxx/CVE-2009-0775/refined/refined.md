  "CVE-2009-0775": {
    "Description": "An anonymous researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative program, reported a vulnerability in Mozilla's garbage collection process.

An attacker could use this crash to run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper memory management of cloned XUL DOM elements linked as parent and child within Mozilla's garbage collection process",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Double free vulnerability due to incorrect memory management in DOM element handling during garbage collection"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the victim's computer.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage containing specially crafted JavaScript."
