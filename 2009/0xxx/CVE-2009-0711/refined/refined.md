Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0711

**Vulnerable Software:** PHPFootball 1.6

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `filter.php` script in PHPFootball 1.6 is vulnerable to remote hash disclosure due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `filter.php` script directly accesses database tables and fields based on user-supplied parameters (`dbtable` and `dbfield`). This allows an attacker to specify database tables and fields that they are not intended to access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The script exposes the content of specified database fields in HTML, without any proper access control or sanitization.
*   **SQL Injection:** Although not explicitly stated in the exploit code, the use of unsanitized user input to query the database may also lead to SQL Injection vulnerabilities, depending on the database access methods used by `filter.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Theft:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can retrieve the password hashes of users stored in the `Accounts` table, which can be used for unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Database Content Exposure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from other database tables and fields, potentially revealing private or confidential data.
*   **Further Attacks:** Stolen credentials can be used for further malicious activities, such as data manipulation, account takeover, and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited using a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `filter.php` script.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the `dbtable` and `dbfield` URL parameters to specify the database table and field they wish to access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable PHPFootball application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and URL parameters to craft a malicious request.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to send a crafted GET request to `filter.php` with the `dbtable` set to `Accounts` and `dbfield` set to `Password` to retrieve user password hashes.
*   The exploit uses regular expressions to extract the password hashes from the HTML response.
*   The Exploit-DB entry also references CVE-2009-0709 and CVE-2009-0710, suggesting that other vulnerabilities might exist in PHPFootball 1.6.
