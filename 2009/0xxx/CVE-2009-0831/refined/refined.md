Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0831:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `members.php` file of the PHP-Fusion Mod Members CV (job) 1.0. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when sorting members, allowing malicious SQL queries to be injected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, which occurs due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (usernames and passwords).
- **Data Manipulation:**  An attacker might also be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database configuration and the exploited SQL query, the attacker might be able to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `members.php` page, specifically manipulating the `sortby` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Authentication:** The exploit description mentions that the attacker needs to be logged in to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some understanding of SQL to craft a working injection.

**Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the user's password from the `fusion_users` table.
- The vulnerable URL is described as:
    `http://Site/[path]/members.php?sortby=%'%20union%20select%200,user_password,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23%20from%20fusion_users/*`
- This exploit requires the user to be logged into the application.
