| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=477864#c0)  Steve Dickson    2008-12-24 13:55:09 UTC  ``` nfs-utils as built in Fedora 9 and 10 is not built with TCP wrappers support.  This means that anyone trying to protect their NFS service via TCP wrappers will not be protected as they would expect.  Also the code that will be enabled does not work when hostnames  are added to /etc/hosts.deny. The code only works with IP address.     -   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=477864#c1)  Steve Dickson    2008-12-24 13:58:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 327813](attachment.cgi?id=327813&action=diff "Proposed Fedora 9 and 10 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=327813&action=edit "Proposed Fedora 9 and 10 patch") Proposed Fedora 9 and 10 patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=477864#c2)  Fedora Update System    2009-01-06 19:45:34 UTC  ``` nfs-utils-1.1.4-6.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/nfs-utils-1.1.4-6.fc10>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=477864#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-01-06 19:56:18 UTC  ``` nfs-utils-1.1.2-9.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/nfs-utils-1.1.2-9.fc9>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=477864#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-01-07 21:53:20 UTC  ``` nfs-utils-1.1.4-6.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 testing repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
