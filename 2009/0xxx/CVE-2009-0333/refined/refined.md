- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `com_waticketsystem` Joomla component is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `catid` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and can be unauthenticated. The provided exploit script demonstrates how to retrieve usernames and passwords.
