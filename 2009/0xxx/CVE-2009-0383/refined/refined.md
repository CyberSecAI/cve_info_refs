{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper authorization checks within the delete.php script. The script directly deletes a post based on the provided post ID without verifying if the user has the necessary permissions to do so.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure direct object reference (IDOR)",
      "Missing authorization checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can arbitrarily delete any post by crafting a specific HTTP request, leading to data loss and potential disruption of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `delete.php` script, specifying the `post` and `confirm` parameters.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable `delete.php` script, the post ID of the post they wish to delete, and be able to send HTTP requests. They don't need to authenticate or gain any form of prior access."
