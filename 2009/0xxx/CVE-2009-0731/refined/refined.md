Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0731:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `play.php` file of the "Free Arcade Script 1.0". The script uses a GET parameter named `template` in an include statement `include ('templates/'.$template.'/footer.php');`. The `$template` variable is not declared, and if `register_globals` is set to `On` in `php.ini`, an attacker can control the `$template` variable via a GET request (e.g. `play.php?template=[lfi]%00`), leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The core vulnerability is that the application includes a file based on a user-controlled variable, without proper sanitization. The attacker can supply a path to a file on the server that is then included in the script.
*   **Uninitialized variable:** Usage of the `$template` variable without prior declaration within the `play.php` script is a primary weakness.
*   **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The exploit depends on the `register_globals` setting being enabled, a deprecated and insecure PHP feature, as this allows the attacker to directly inject a value into the `$template` variable through a GET parameter.
*   **Remote Command Execution via Apache Log Injection:** By exploiting the LFI, the attacker can include the Apache access log file. Beforehand, the attacker injects PHP code into the access log via a crafted HTTP request. This allows the attacker to then execute arbitrary PHP code through the inclusion of the modified access log, essentially gaining Remote Command Execution (RCE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting PHP code into the web server's access logs, which is then included via LFI. This gives the attacker the ability to gain control over the affected system.
*   **Data Exposure:**  LFI could be used to access sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing configurations, source code, or database credentials.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `play.php` and includes the `template` parameter to control the inclusion path and then injects code into apache logs.
*   **Log Injection:** The attacker injects malicious php code into the access logs using a crafted request, which is then included in `play.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **PHP Configuration:** The `register_globals` setting in `php.ini` must be enabled for the LFI to be directly exploitable through the `template` parameter. However, the exploit script provided also uses log injection to execute commands, so even if `register_globals` is off, the server is still vulnerable.
*   **Knowledge of Apache Log Paths:** The attacker needs a list of possible Apache access log file paths to test for inclusion. The provided exploit script already has a list of such paths to attempt.

**Additional Details from the Exploit:**

*   The provided exploit script automates the process of injecting PHP code into the Apache log files by sending a specific request to the server and then attempting to include the log files by exploiting the LFI vulnerability.
*   The script then executes commands via the injected PHP code.
*   The script includes a list of common Apache log file paths to facilitate exploitation.
