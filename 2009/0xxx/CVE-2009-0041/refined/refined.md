  "CVE-2009-0041": {
    "description": "IAX2 provides a different response during authentication when a user does not exist, as compared to when the password is merely wrong. This allows an attacker to scan a host to find specific users on which to concentrate password cracking attempts.",

        "Information Leakage",
         "Inconsistent response handling"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can enumerate valid usernames, enabling targeted brute-force password attacks.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote network access via the IAX2 protocol.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send IAX2 requests to the target server"
