* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine when restoring closed tabs. If a

user were tricked into restoring a tab to a malicious website with form input

controls, an attacker could steal local files on the user's system.

([CVE-2009-0355](/security/CVE-2009-0355))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not restrict access to cookies in

HTTP response headers. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web

page, a remote attacker could view sensitive information. ([CVE-2009-0357](/security/CVE-2009-0357))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-05

## XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies

Announced
February 3, 2009
Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.6
* SeaMonkey 1.1.15

### Description

Developer and Mozilla community member **Wladimir Palant**
reported that cookies marked HTTPOnly were readable by JavaScript via
the `XMLHttpRequest.getResponseHeader` and `XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders` APIs. This vulnerability
bypasses the security mechanism provided by the HTTPOnly flag which
intends to restrict JavaScript access to `document.cookie`.

The fix prevents the XMLHttpRequest feature from accessing the
`Set-Cookie` and `Set-Cookie2` headers of any response
whether or not the HTTPOnly flag was set for those cookies.

firefox security update (RHSA-2009-0256)

Original Release Date: February 4, 2009

Last Revised: February 4, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-040

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content.
A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2009-0352](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0352), [CVE-2009-0353](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0353) and [CVE-2009-0356](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0356) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed.
A
website containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2009-0354](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0354) and
[CVE-2009-0355](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0355) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated HTTPOnly cookies. An
attacker
able to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a target site using HTTPOnly
cookies may be able to use this flaw to steal the cookie.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2009-0357](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0357) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated certain HTTP page caching
directives. A local attacker could steal the contents of sensitive pages
which the page author did not intend to be cached.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2009-0358](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0358) to this issue.

For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
security advisories for Firefox 3.0.6.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0256.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-717-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

10 February 2009

Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) -
* [xulrunner-1.9](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow

an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2009-0352](/security/CVE-2009-0352), [CVE-2009-0353](/security/CVE-2009-0353))

A flaw was discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could bypass the

same-origin policy in Firefox by utilizing a chrome XBL method and execute

arbitrary JavaScript within the context of another website. ([CVE-2009-0354](/security/CVE-2009-0354))

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine when restoring closed tabs. If a

user were tricked into restoring a tab to a malicious website with form input

controls, an attacker could steal local files on the user's system.

([CVE-2009-0355](/security/CVE-2009-0355))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not restrict access to cookies in

HTTP response headers. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web

page, a remote attacker could view sensitive information. ([CVE-2009-0357](/security/CVE-2009-0357))

Paul Nel discovered that Firefox did not honor certain Cache-Control HTTP

directives. A local attacker could exploit this to view private data in

improperly cached pages of another user. ([CVE-2009-0358](/security/CVE-2009-0358))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=483150#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-01-29 20:52:06 UTC  ``` Paul Nel reported that certain HTTP directives to not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and Cache-Control: no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by Firefox 3. On a shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP directives could potentially expose private data.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

XMLHttpRequest subverts the idea of HTTPOnly cookies since it allows sending a request and reading out Set-Cookie header of the response - even if it has HTTPOnly flag set. There are quite a few web applications out there that will send out a Set-Cookie header with the session cookie for every request just in case, thus rendering HTTPOnly flag ineffective.
To test you can go to <http://www.yabbforum.com/community/> and use this bookmarklet:
javascript:var req = new XMLHttpRequest();req.open("GET", "/community/", false);req.send(null);alert(req.getAllResponseHeaders());alert(req.getResponseHeader("Set-Cookie"))
You will see a list of all response headers including Set-Cookie, and then the result of req.getResponseHeader("Set-Cookie"). I think Set-Cookie headers should be excluded from the list and req.getResponseHeader("Set-Cookie") should always return null. This protection is only necessary for unprivileged scripts, the implementation can be the same as in setRequestHeader.

It works in Opera as well - but on the other hand, I don't have an Opera build with HTTPOnly support yet. It also works in IE6. However, according to <http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070511/bluehat-errata/> this is fixed in IE7 (I couldn't verify this).

Jesse, [bug 178993](/show_bug.cgi?id=178993 "RESOLVED FIXED - MSIE-extension: HttpOnly cookie attribute for cross-site scripting vulnerability prevention") will only land after 1.8.1.4 (if approved), is there a point in having blocking1.8.1.4 here?

Moved the code used to verify request headers into a separate function so that it can be used for response headers as well. There was one functional change - instead of throwing on security manager errors I simply fall back to the "unprivileged script" case, that should be a sane thing to do here. The other relevant test case for this patch is <http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/content/base/test/test_bug308484.html>Assignee: xml → trev.mozStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Robert, this list goes back to [bug 302263](/show_bug.cgi?id=302263 "RESOLVED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows dangerous request headers to be set") and the discussion there mentions the WHATWG spec (that is on W3C now). However, some of the forbidden headers actually seem harmless.

Given that discussion, I agree that changing the list doesn't need to happen in this bug. and you need a real sr. :)

Proposed patch and mochitest testcase
I'd prefer the the nsHeaderVisitor ctor took an |const char \*\*aInvalidHeaders| argument rather than having a separate setter function. Otherwise it's very easy to forget which is hard to notice but is bad security wise.

So much about "no arguments constructor com policy" - but yes, fine with me, it makes the code much cleaner.
Requesting approval1.8.1.5 for this patch - [bug 178993](/show_bug.cgi?id=178993 "RESOLVED FIXED - MSIE-extension: HttpOnly cookie attribute for cross-site scripting vulnerability prevention") is landing on 1.8.1 branch so this should as well.

Patch to be checked in
This patch makes me nervous -- it looks like you stop reading any cookies, not just the httponly ones mentioned in the summary. I wish this had landed for 1.9a6 so we could get some real-world testing on it, and failing that I don't want to approve it until it's gotten as much trunk nightly baking as possible.
Not minusing, but clearing the request until it's gotten some baking. Please re-request branch approval after landing on trunk.

The visitor isn't an XPCOM object which makes it ok IMHO. In general we're moving away from restricting ourselves to all the rules of XPCOM except when it makes sence.
The ctor for all DOM nodes takes arguments.
The case when you don't want ctor arguments is when the object is being instantiated using XPCOM through do\_CreateInstance.

Patch to be checked in
Just tested IE7 and results were what I expected: Given a page that returns a mixture of httponly and regular cookies, IE7 does in fact let XMLHttpRequest see the regular Set-Cookie headers as in the past and strips out only the httponly ones.
I'm afraid I have to give this patch an r-minus
>+ PRBool privileged = PR\_FALSE;
>+ if (privilege) {
>+ nsIScriptSecurityManager \*secMan = nsContentUtils::GetSecurityManager();
>+ if (secMan) {

>+ }
Why not replace the above with nsContentUtils::IsCallerTrustedForRead() (or Write()) depending on a boolean flag passed rather than a string?
But I don't think UniversalBrowserRead should be good enough to read a header that is explicitly saying "script should never see this". UniversalXPConnect/chrome, sure, but not just "can access windows from other domains". And I likewise don't think UniversalBrowserWrite is good enough to set headers we've said are dangerous for content to set.
In that case nsContentUtils::IsCallerChrome() ought to cover it (ok, that only checks for true chrome and not the equivalent UniversalXPConnect, but you can argue that everywhere else it's used is similarly broken and we should add the UniversalXPConnect check to IsCallerChrome and fix them all at once).

I take back all I said about IE7 working, I have no idea what RSnake's article is talking about.
getAllResponseHeaders() in IE7 gets \_all\_ response headers, including the httponly cookies.
getResponseHeader() returns the \_first\_ header of a given name. At first I thought this was working because I only had two cookies and the httponly one was second. But when I added a third non-httponly one, or swapped them, or made 5 cookies, it became clear it was just the first cookie set whether it was httponly or not.
Loading the same URL as a web page in IE& and running javascript:alert(document.cookie) showed me the correct number of non-httponly cookies and none of the httponly ones, so I know my Set-Cookie syntax matched what IE expected.Keywords: [checkin-needed](/buglist.cgi?keywords=checkin-needed&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [sg:want]

hm... if IE only shows one cookie of many then it's hard to imagine AJAX apps relying on XHR cookie access... Maybe we can afford to just drop the header entirely after all.
I'd feel better if we got some buy-in from other browser vendors/web app developers on the webapi mailing list and got some consistent restrictions embedded in the spec (<http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/>)

Drive-by note: you can set custom headers on Mochitest pages without having to do channel gunk, which is much easier to read. I didn't look too hard, but I don't think you actually need anything special that can't be provided by statically-set headers:
<http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mochitest#How_do_I_change_the_HTTP_headers_or_status_sent_with_a_file_used_in_a_Mochitest.3F>
Do note that you can't set multiple headers that way, which unfortunately might be a problem here. :-\ The server running this stuff was written in the (perhaps too ideal) world where multiple headers of the same name can always be combined into one header of the same name with value being the comma-joined header values, but I can change that if you really need it.

Jim: do you mean that we should follow IE7 in exposing http-only cookies in getAllResponseHeaders, but only show the first header in getResponseHeader? Unless Dan's analysis in [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c15 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") is mistaken -- test cases demonstrating such are very welcome -- it seems like IE also exposes HttpOnly cookies here.

Mike: No. IE7 quietly ignores requests to read pre-existing HttpOnly cookies via the js calls getAllResponseHeaders and getResponseHeader as it rightly should. However, the set-cookie header still exposes HttpOnly cookies in all browsers (see <http://ha.ckers.org/httponly.cgi> )

And you are right again that RSnakes' post saying that ie7 fixes the XMLHttpRequest HttpOnly cookie exposing issues is wrong. Regardless, can we agree that this should be fixed in FireFox? :) And last, I will set up a verbose test page that the FireFox team can use illustrate this vulnerability.

It should be fixed in Firefox, which is why this bug isn't WONTFIX or INVALID. I think the ha.ckers.org page is ample for developing against, though if you wanted to write a mochitest or two (see waldo's [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") for some limitations) that would be helpful.

I just tested, IE 7.0.6001.18000 still exposes HTTPOnly cookies via set-cookie headers in XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders()
From the OWASP WebGoat HTTPOnly lab:
Results:
\* FAILURE: Your browser does not prevent an XMLHTTPRequest read for the 'unique2u' cookie.
However, I would be thrilled to see FireFox lead the charge and be the first browser to truly implement HttpOnly correctly and completely.

Attached patch

[Patch fixing the ha.ckers.org/httponly.cgi issue](attachment.cgi?id=339447&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=339447&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=380418&attachment=339447)

This is a proof-of-concept which handles the example at <http://ha.ckers.org/httponly.cgi> . I'm attaching it to get feedback on the basic idea, as well as some issues described below.
The basic idea is to strip off httpOnly-cookies from each Set-Cookie header when nsHeaderVisitor::VisitHeader() assembles the array of response-headers. However, no checks for UniversalBrowserRead or similar (see e.g. [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") above) are done. Please advise whether this is necessary or not. Moreover, if nsHeaderVisitor::VisitHeader() is used in other contexts, the implementation may have to be improved. Please advise.
Some more challenging test-cases should also be provided to ensure that it works properly, in particular the situation where there are only httpOnly cookies in a header : Should we just drop the header or should we return an empty set-cookie header?
Finally, referring to the TODO in the patch, if it's ok to introduce a dependency to the netwerk/cookie module, we could use the static method nsCookieService::GetTokenValue() instead of copying the code. Please advise.

I completely agree with [comment #36](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies"), and the patch implements this behavior.
Moreover, I find no code other than GetAllReponseHeaders() referring to nsHeaderVisitor, and I find no calls to GetAllReponseHeaders() in the codebase either. Thus, I seems safe to assume that this change in nsHeaderVisitor::VisitHeader() will not introduce regressions. However, this is obviously just based on reading the code and must be verified during normal test-procedures.
Awaiting review as well as comments to these open questions :
1) Referring to the TODO in the patch, is it ok to introduce a dependency to the netwerk/cookie module? If so, we could use the static method nsCookieService::GetTokenValue() instead of copying code into nsXMLHttpRequest
2) Do we need checks for UniversalBrowserRead or similar (see e.g. [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies")) or do we trust the claim about not introducing regressions? Or put in a different way : are there any scripts that SHOULD be allowed to see httpOnly-cookies?
3) Tests are needed. I can whip up some unit-tests or something one of these days, but if other people are working on this (see [comment #26](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") and [comment #28](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c28 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies")), I'd be happy to wait.

You are only fixing getAllResponseHeaders, need to fix getResponseHeader as well.
So I'm not sure that we want to do things this way. It seems very complicated. I think we should simply deny access to the cookie and auth headers entirely.

I can quickly fix getResponseHeader using the same mechanism on Monday.

The fundamental idea is to return a copy of the cookies, exactly like the original code does, but strip off those marked as httponly. This, imho, is not highly complicated. :)
The patch itself contains a lot of code, I agree, but most of it is cut'n'paste from another module since I didn't want to mess around with the Makefile-magic necessary to access those methods from nsXMLHttpRequest. See open question 1 in [comment #39](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c39 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") and comment in the patch. Thus, most of the code can be removed if it's ok to introduce a dependency like that - I'm awaiting a decision or recommendation on this one.
> I think we should simply deny access to the cookie and auth headers entirely.
About (other) auth headers : It's the first time I've seen that mentioned in this defect. Is this an issue as well? Is there a discussion or defect about that somewhere? Test-case?
My understanding from the discussion in this defect is that the desired behaviour is to allow access to cookies except for the httponly ones. This has been implemented for getAllResponseHeaders and I can also do it for getResponseHeader. If this is \*not\* the desired behaviour, however, I'd be happy to implement something else. Just let me know what it should be. :)

This is a starting-point for a test-case. Comments are welcome.
The idea is to extend the test by adding to the global cookies-array with combinations of cookies to be set by the server and the expected value of the Set-Cookie-header.

I see from comments in nsCookieService::ParseAttributes() that the cookie-implementation explicitly does not handle comma-separated cookies in one header, but rather require \n or \r to separate them. Must be fixed in the test-code...

Challenge : Combine the statement in [comment #47](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c47 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") with these facts about how nsHttpServer set header-values
1) if the value in the call response.setHeader(name, value) contains \n or \r, an NS\_ERROR\_INVALID\_ARG exception is thrown
2) splitting the value around \n or \r and call response.setHeader(name, value, true) for each cookie results in a header with a list of comma-separated values (as stated in RFC 2616, section 4.2)
Summing up : the (xpcshell) unit-test cannot use commas to separate cookies since the code from nsCookieService does not handle comma-separated cookies. Moreover, response.setHeader() in nsHttpServer will either construct a comma-separated list of cookies, or throw an exception if the cookies are separated with \n or \r.
I'll change the copied code to handle comma-separated cookies...

So I absolutely don't think we should duplicate this code. This is security critical code so it's important that we keep it consistent everywhere.
So either we should do the simple thing and block all 'Set-Cookie' headers completely. Or we should muck around with the APIs such that you can call into the same parsing function as the real cookie code is using.

I couldn't agree more. :) If the decision is to strip off httponly cookies and show the rest, the only sensible solution is to tap into the code used in the cookie-module. The other strategy (block Set-Cookie headers) is dead simple to implement...
However, I'm almost there with a patch to handle commas. I'll attach it together with a working unit-test to verify that the concept is sound. Are there existing tests for cookies somewhere that I can use to verify my code in addition to my unit-test?
(Btw, there is also [bug #370639](/show_bug.cgi?id=370639 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Using comma (\",\") delimiter instead \";\" (semi-colon) in Cookie header by default is not useful") which points out an interesting issue, although not 100% related to this one.)

i agree with sicking here - no way should this be copy-paste. if we really do want a subset of cookies, let's API it up.
why aren't we just removing them altogether ([comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c16 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") and [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies"))? sicking, did anything come of the webapi wg?

yes, there's a TestCookie binary unit test in netwerk/test or somesuch, and there are cookie mochitests based in extensions/cookie/test{s}.

Yes, by all means. :) But the cookie code I found and copied does not handle comma-separated cookies. This patch handles commas, and because of this I can now run the unit-test and verify that the strategy for removing httponly-cookies works.
(If there is other code somewhere which does handle cookies separated by commas, please point me to it...)

I spent the day patching nsCookieService::GetTokenValue(). All tests in the TestCookie binary as well as cookie-mochitests run successfully with it, and I'll attach it a little later. The same code pasted into nsXMLHttpRequest also successfully run the previously attached unit-tests for this defect.
Now, I would like to outline three different strategies for handling this defect. Deciding which one to follow is not up to me, but I assume the right stakeholder(s) will make the decision.
Listed from simplest to most complex, I see these alternatives :
Alt #1 : We block access to the Set-Cookie-header from getAllResponseHeaders() and getResponseHeader(). This is simple to do, but may not be the most helpful strategy for the users.
Alt #2 : We use the existing nsCookieService::GetTokenValue() and in order to get a proper unit-test I fix nsHttpServer to handle cookies separated by \n and \r. This is safe and should not be too hard to do, but I need some assistance to expose the method from the cookie-module. (I can make it compile, but the linker complains, so I guess the method must be annotated somehow to export it from the lib.)
Alt #3 : We patch nsCookieService::GetTokenValue() to handle comma-separated cookies and expose it in order to use it from nsXMLHttpRequest. The unit-test for this defect will work with the existing nsHttpServer, but I still need assistance to expose the method from the cookie-module. This is by far the most risky alternative, replacing code in the cookie-module, but if there are reasons for actually following RFCs 2109 and 2965, allowing cookies to be separated by commas, then this is the right alternative.
I'll await a decision and attach the mentioned patch for information a little later when I have cleaned up the code.

Why would we want to change how the cookie service parses anything at all? That scares me a lot. Comma separated cookies results in a ambiguous syntax as I recall it since the expire date can contain commas. Parsing cookies in a web compatible way (which is very different from any specs) is hard and very quirky. And security critical.
\*if\* we want to expose Set-Cookie at all I think we should reuse the existing code exactly as it is. Just make changes needed to expose the existing parsing functionality though APIs that the XHR object can reach.
However the more I think about it the more I think we should just block getting Set-Cookie at all. Cookies are way too charged with security, we have no idea what future updates to cookies might bring. And the value of getting Set-Cookie seems dubious at best.
So unless someone oppose, lets just block getting Set-Cookie entirely.

Currently, scripts with chrome-privileges are allowed to see the Set-Cookie header. Whether this is desirable is an open question. Whether to block the Set-Cookie2 header as well is also an open question.
I have a hard time setting up a unit-test for this since xpcshell-scripts run with chrome-privileges and so does mochitests (according to the docs). Thus, there is no unit-test submitted and the fix has only been verified using the ha.ckers.org webpage. The code-change is trivial, though... If somebody can show me how to run a test \*without\* chrome-privileges I'd be happy to write one for this defect.

Me too, for sure. :)

This seems to be covered by some of the existing cookie-tests, and it is handled by the patch.

We don't disagree here. :)

I'm leaning towards this one (alternative 2 in [comment #56](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c56 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies")). However, if there is any desire for supporting comma-separated cookies among whoever is working with the cookie-module, then the submitted patch handles commas and passes all existing cookie-tests. It's still a bit scary, though... :)

Very well. See patch above. :)

Btw, while working on this I found some possibly related (not duplicated) defects : defect #250859 and defect #358320. Defect #370639 has already been mentioned in [comment #50](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c50 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies"), although this is about constructing the cookie-string to send.

Good point... :) If the decision really is to follow the simplest strategy and just block the header, your original patch with the suggested modification will probably do the trick. Sicking...? Dveditz...?

If you use IsCapabilityEnabled("UniversalXPConnect") rather than nsContentUtils::IsCallerChrome you can easily test for that using mochitest directly. See

Attached patch

[Patch implementing the simplest strategy, honoring comments from reviewer and including unit-test by Wladimir Palant](attachment.cgi?id=343525&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=343525&action=edit)

Validations in setRequestHeader() resulting from [bug #302263](/show_bug.cgi?id=302263 "RESOLVED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows dangerous request headers to be set") is not touched by this patch. However, it should be pointed out that UniversalBrowserWrite is sufficient to pass these validations, which may not be good enough (see [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies")).
The unit-test is a clean copy of the (excellent) one by Wladimir Palant.
For the record : I still think strategies 2 and 3 from [comment #56](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c56 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") will result in an overall better product, but this is not my call. :)

This looks great!! Thanks for doing this.
An alternative way to getting the channel and calling setResponseHeader is to use ^header^ files to actually get those headers set. See

Nit: If you first check that Set-Cookie is normally blocked, \*then\* call netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege, and then check that you now can get to it, you won't have to mess with setting a timeout.

Sigh, don't we have anyone watching the checkin-needed flag these days? Or is the tree simply too backed up with bigger things needing to land?

Does anyone know how they handle it? Do they just block the header, like the patch for this defect does, or do they filter out only httponly-cookies? (I don't have a MS-system available to test it myself...)

Just checked with IE6 after update - request.getResponseHeader() displays the cookie without httponly flag, request.getAllResponseHeaders() displays Set-Cookie header for the unprotected cookie but not the cookie with httponly flag. So IE really only filters out httponly-cookies.

If you have a mixture of both "normal" and httponly cookies, do they only block the httponly ones, or do they block all of them?
Either way, I think we should try our solution due to its simplicity.

I tested on <http://ha.ckers.org/httponly.cgi> - yes, they filter out httponly cookie while letting through the normal one. And of course I prefer the simple solution as well.

Gavin: Why? The main reason I see for taking this for beta is so that we can get wide trunk testing sooner in order for porting it to branch. Had a discussion with damon about this at lunch and he was in favor of just letting the branch porting wait.

Yeah, that's actually true, if we're not having a beta3 then I think this really should go in for beta2. Talked with jst and he things we should get it in now, so setting as beta2 blocker and re-adding to metered landings.Priority: P2 → P1Target Milestone: --- → mozilla1.9.1b2

Looks like IE's recent patch (<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-069.mspx>) now stops set-cookie exposure to HTTPOnly cookies via JavaScript - but not set-cookie2 HTTPOnly exposure. <http://ha.ckers.org/httponly.cgi> was updated to include set-cookie and set-cookie2 tests today, btw.

Note IE does not return a single Set-Cookie header. As such, getResponseHeader('Set-Cookie') now only returns the first non-httponly Set-Cookie header. But that probable made it simpler for them to just filter the httponly Set-Cookie headers.
Also note, combining Set-Cookie headers with a comma separator has issues with comma being a legal value in an individual Set-Cookie header.
I doubt there are useful apps out there that rely on being able to parse Set-Cookie headers from getAllResponseHeaders(). If there are, we might be breaking more of them by combining multiple Set-Cookie headers into a single one already.

Robert Hansen was not fond of the fact that ALL cookies were removed from the XHR response headers via JS access. I'm not sure I agree, but felt it prudent to pass his thoughts your way. What do you think?
(from Robert Hansen re: The fact that all set-cookie/2 calls were removed from response headers)
That's kind of a bug (or at minimum a bad feature). XHR should allow any headers to be viewed that don't have the HTTPOnly flag. Who knows, maybe some web developers use XMLHTTPRequest to read the cookie (which might contain something benign like last seen date) and use it to display it back on the page? Now HTTPOnly breaks that functionality. The last thing you want is people removing HTTPOnly to re-enable functionality that already worked.
Firefox overstepped the whole point of the security feature. You don't start disabling random other things just because you disable one. Think about it from a developer's perspective. You're sitting in a conference room, and you're not that brilliant and you say, "I heard that if you use HTTPOnly sometimes you won't be able to read not HTTPOnly cookies." And you less than brilliant developer friend says, "Whelp, I guess we had better not consider it, we need to read those cookies, by golly." And henceforth you have lower adoption.
HTTPOnly has had enough problems without introducing extremely hard to understand "features" (hard to understand unless you are intimately familiar with the tech). Plus, I have been known to replay cookies using XHR before too, because I want the exact syntax (including path name and expiration), and not the slimmed down document.cookie version of the actual header. It's not all that uncommon. It would be a nightmare do debug if I didn't know that Firefox had done that (on a different cookie, no less). I'd bet a dollar most developers wouldn't have a clue as to why it was happening.

Robert misunderstands, I believe. We never show set-cookie in XHR results, regardless of whether there is an HTTPOnly cookie in the response or not, so use of HTTPOnly doesn't affect anything here. Ergo, there's no reason to avoid it in favour of more functionality.
(That's my interpretation of the patch, at least, I haven't tested exhaustively.)

Right, and Roberts claim is that developers need the ability to read non-HTTPOnly cookies from the XHR response headers, which IE 7x currently allows, but FF 3.0.0.6 does not.

See #87 regarding how useful Set-Cookie response headers are. You can parse the non-httponly cookies from document.cookie more reliably. And spec says implementations are free to drop transient headers and security related like set-cookie are called out specifically. The current 3.0.6 behavior is just fine.

Re: [comment 103](/show_bug.cgi?id=380418#c103 "VERIFIED FIXED - XMLHttpRequest allows reading HTTPOnly cookies") -- removing HttpOnly from your cookies will not bring the functionality back. That won't be a temptation. If we had hidden only headers with HTTPOnly cookies then developers \*might\* be tempted to remove that attribute. Developers might get pissed at us for our aggressive approach here, but it cannot be accused of discouraging adoption of HttpOnly since the functionality is gone whether or not you use it.
I've filed [bug 476977](/show_bug.cgi?id=476977 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Expose cookie details to the DOM") on enhancing the DOM with the additional cookie data that developers might be trying to get out of manually parsing headers from XHR.

(from Robert Hansen)
I read the thread, and that makes more sense. I thought XHR was disabling all because one cookie had HTTPOnly. I didn’t realize it was independent of that feature. That’s less bad. Still, it’s going to cause some people to riot in the streets when they’re trying to get code to work regardless of how secure their cookies are, but at least it won’t harm HTTPOnly adoption, they’re correct.

As far as developers go, a much better solution for them is to use tools like the LiveHTTPHeaders or FireBug extensions.

Critical: firefox security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0256)

## Topic

An updated firefox package that fixes various security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-0352, CVE-2009-0353, CVE-2009-0356)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. A
website containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2009-0354,
CVE-2009-0355)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated HTTPOnly cookies. An attacker
able to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a target site using HTTPOnly
cookies may be able to use this flaw to steal the cookie. (CVE-2009-0357)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated certain HTTP page caching
directives. A local attacker could steal the contents of sensitive pages
which the page author did not intend to be cached. (CVE-2009-0358)

For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
security advisories for Firefox 3.0.6. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.6, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Mozilla Firefox browser is updated to version 3.0.6 fixing various
security and stability issues.
MFSA 2009-01 / CVE-2009-0352 / CVE-2009-0353: Mozilla developers
identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used
in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes
showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and
we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be
exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2009-02 / CVE-2009-0354: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that a chrome XBL method can be used in conjunction with
window.eval to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of
another website, violating the same origin policy. Firefox 2 releases
are not affected.
MFSA 2009-03 / CVE-2009-0355: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that a form input controls type could be changed during the
restoration of a closed tab. An attacker could set an input controls
text value to the path of a local file whose location was known to
the attacker. If the tab was then closed and the victim persuaded
to re-open it, upon restoring the tab the attacker could use this
vulnerability to change the input type to file. Scripts in the page
could then automatically submit the form and steal the contents of
the user's local file.
MFSA 2009-04 / CVE-2009-0356: Mozilla security researcher Georgi
Guninski reported that the fix for an earlier vulnerability reported
by Liu Die Yu using local internet shortcut files to access other
sites (MFSA 2008-47) could be bypassed by redirecting to a privileged
about: URI such as about:plugins. If an attacker could get a victim
to download two files, a malicious HTML file and a .desktop shortcut
file, they could have the HTML document load a privileged chrome
document via the shortcut and both documents would be treated as same
origin. This vulnerability could potentially be used by an attacker
to inject arbitrary code into the chrome document and execute with
chrome privileges. Because this attack has relatively high complexity,
the severity of this issue was determined to be moderate.
MFSA 2009-05 / CVE-2009-0357: Developer and Mozilla community
member Wladimir Palant reported that cookies marked HTTPOnly were
readable by JavaScript via the XMLHttpRequest.getResponseHeader and
XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders APIs. This vulnerability bypasses
the security mechanism provided by the HTTPOnly flag which intends to
restrict JavaScript access to document.cookie.
The fix prevents the XMLHttpRequest feature from accessing the
Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers of any response whether or not
the HTTPOnly flag was set for those cookies.
MFSA 2009-06 / CVE-2009-0358: Paul Nel reported that certain HTTP
directives to not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and
Cache-Control: no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by
Firefox 3. On a shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP
directives could potentially expose private data. Another user on the
system could use this vulnerability to view improperly cached pages
containing private data by navigating the browser back.
Fixes for older Firefox and other Mozilla versions are being worked on.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
