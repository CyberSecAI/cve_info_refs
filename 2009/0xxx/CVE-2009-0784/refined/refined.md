{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the stap tool within Systemtap, an instrumentation system for Linux 2.6.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Race Condition: The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `stap` tool. This allows for a timing-based exploit to bypass intended security restrictions."
    ],
    "impact": "Local Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation allows members of the `stapusr` group to gain privileges equivalent to members of the `stapdev` group, potentially leading to root access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local: The attack must originate from a user account that is a member of the `stapusr` group.",
        "Exploiting the race condition: This involves exploiting the timing vulnerability in the `stap` tool to bypass directory confinement restrictions."
    ],
        "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker must have a local account",
          "Attacker must be part of the `stapusr` group."
        ],
    "additional_info": "This vulnerability was only exploitable if another SystemTap kernel module was placed in the `systemtap/` module directory for the currently running kernel."
