Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany,
	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Hello Steve,

  initially CVE-2008-4863 has been assigned for the Blender's
untrusted search path issue.

Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the
beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python
maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need
of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading
Python modules.

Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in
the following packages:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=481570#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 13:19:34 UTC  ``` Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Python language bindings  for Nautilus allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to an erroneous setting of sys.path by the PySys_SetArgv function.  References (more details, PoC): <http://www.nabble.com/Bug-484305%3A-bicyclerepair%3A-bike.vim-imports-untrusted-python-files-from-cwd-td18848099.html>  Proposed patch: The Debian patch for similar dia's Python related issue, available at:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;filename=pythonpath.diff;att=1;bug=504251>  should be sufficient to resolve this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=481570#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 13:20:17 UTC  ``` This issue affects all versions of the nautilus-python package, as shipped with Fedora releases of 9, 10 and devel.  Please fix.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=481570#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-28 11:04:18 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-0317](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0317) to this vulnerability:  Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Python language bindings for Nautilus (nautilus-python) allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to a vulnerability in the PySys_SetArgv function ([CVE-2008-5983](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5983)).  References: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0317> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/01/26/2> [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481570](show_bug.cgi?id=481570 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-0317 nautilus-python: untrusted python modules search path")   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=481570#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-29 11:28:12 UTC  ``` More explanation why this issue wasn't fixed in Python yet, can be found here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5983 python: untrusted python modules search path")  here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5983 python: untrusted python modules search path")  and here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c5 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5983 python: untrusted python modules search path")  Looks like the Python fix won't come anytime soon, so please fix the issue in the package, till we find the proper Python solution.  Ray Strode's test case to check the work of the fix can be found here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8](show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-0314 gedit: untrusted python modules search path")   ``` |  |
