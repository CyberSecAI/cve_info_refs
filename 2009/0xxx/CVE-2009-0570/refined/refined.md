Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-0570:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Insecure Backup:** The `admin.php` script creates backups of the `maillist.php` file using a predictable naming scheme based on the current date.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `send.php` script includes files from the `outbox/` directory based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Predictable Backup Filenames:** The backup filenames are generated using `date("jnY").'.txt'`, making them easily guessable if an attacker knows when the backup was created. This allows unauthorized access to the backed-up file, which likely contains sensitive data.
*   **Unsanitized Input in File Inclusion:** The `send.php` script uses the `$load` GET parameter to include files, without any input validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to specify any local file on the server, leading to LFI.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The LFI vulnerability is further exploitable by injecting a null byte (`%00`) to terminate the file path, allowing access to files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Insecure Backup:** An attacker can gain access to the `maillist.php` file which could contain sensitive information such as database credentials or other application secrets.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to, potentially including system configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Insecure Backup:** The attacker needs to know, or guess, the date on which the backup was created, and then request the generated filename directly through the web server.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The attacker must send a request to `send.php` with the `load` GET parameter containing the path to the desired file, with or without null byte injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Insecure Backup:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and guess the path to files to include.
