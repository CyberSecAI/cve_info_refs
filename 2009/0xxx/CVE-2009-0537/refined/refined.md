{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `fts_level` field within the `ftsent` structure used by the `fts` library functions. This field, a short integer, tracks the depth of a file hierarchy traversal. Due to the short integer limitation, when traversing very deep directory structures, this counter overflows leading to incorrect memory access during path construction.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer overflow in the `fts_level` field",
    "Lack of proper bounds checking during path construction",
    "Potential for out-of-bounds memory access"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation leads to a denial of service. Programs using the vulnerable `fts_*` functions crash (segmentation fault) or exhibit other buggy behavior like stack overflows.",
  "Attack vectors": "Creating deep directory structures with a large nesting level to cause integer overflow on the `fts_level` field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create directory structures. This can be local for local programs like 'du' or by utilizing specific software on the target system to create deep directory structures, as demonstrated with Microsoft Interix."
