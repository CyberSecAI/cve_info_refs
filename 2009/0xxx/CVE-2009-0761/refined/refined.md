Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **File Disclosure (DD):** The application is vulnerable to file disclosure, allowing an attacker to access sensitive files such as the `team.mdb` database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is susceptible to cross-site scripting, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the `online.asp` page.

**Root Cause:**
*   **File Disclosure:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access controls, allowing direct access to the database file.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation and output sanitization of the `lookname` parameter in the `online.asp` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored in the `team.mdb` database, potentially leading to data breaches, exposure of user credentials, or other confidential information.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the victim's browser, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or deface the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Disclosure:** The attacker can directly access the database file through its URL (`http://site.com/[Path]/data/team.mdb`).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing a script within the `lookname` parameter of the `online.asp` page (`http://site.com/[Path]/online.asp?lookname=>"><ScRiPt%20%0a%0d>alert(1369)%3B</ScRiPt>`). This URL can be delivered through various means, such as emails, social media or other websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the path where the vulnerable application is installed.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
* The content also lists multiple vulnerable sites as 'Victims', providing a clearer picture of the scope of the vulnerability.
* The content references CVE-2009-0761 and CVE-2009-0760

**Summary:**
The content describes a web application vulnerable to both file disclosure and cross-site scripting. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary code within the user's browser.
