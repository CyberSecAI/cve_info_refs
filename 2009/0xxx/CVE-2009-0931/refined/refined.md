The provided content describes two vulnerabilities fixed in Horde Application Framework versions 3.2.4 and 3.3.3, as well as Horde Groupware version 1.1.5.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unescaped output in the tag cloud search script:**
    *   **Weakness:** Improper output sanitization.
    *  **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability which can potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious script into a user's browser session.
    *   **Attack vector:**  Malicious script injected via tag cloud search script input.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to inject malicious script through the tag cloud search functionality
2.  **Unvalidated Horde\_Image driver name:**
    *   **Root cause:** Lack of validation for the Horde_Image driver name.
    *   **Weakness:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files on the server. This could lead to information disclosure or potentially remote code execution if the included files contain malicious code or expose sensitive information.
    *   **Attack vector:**  Manipulation of the Horde_Image driver parameter.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:**  Ability to manipulate the Horde_Image driver parameter.

The security fixes in Horde versions 3.2.4 and 3.3.3, and Horde Groupware 1.1.5 address both vulnerabilities. The releases also credit Gunnar Wrobel for discovering the issues through a code audit.
