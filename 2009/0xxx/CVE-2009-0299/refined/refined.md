Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `index.php` file of Groone's GLink Organizer. Specifically, the `cat` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `cat` parameter in the `index.php` file. Both standard and blind SQL injection techniques can be used.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `cat` parameter, which allows for the injection of malicious SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information.
- **Data Modification:**  An attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Full Database Control:** In severe cases, an attacker might gain full control of the database server depending on the permissions available to the database user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `index.php` and modifying the value of the `cat` parameter to include SQL injection code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability, as it is related to unsanitized user input.
- The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is accessible over the web.

**Specifics from provided content:**

*   **Exploit-DB #7878**: Demonstrates a direct SQL injection using `UNION SELECT` to extract the database version: `http://localhost/[path]/index.php?cat=-1 union select 1,@@version,3 %23`.
*   **Exploit-DB #9236**: Demonstrates a blind SQL injection technique to extract data. It uses `substring()` and boolean conditions to determine information by observing the application's response. The specific example is `http://www.groonesworld.com/demos/glinks/index.php?cat=82%20and%20substring(@@version,1,1)=5`.
