Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in RavenNuke 2.3.0, specifically related to CVE-2009-0672:

**CVE-2009-0672:** This CVE is one of several related to vulnerabilities in RavenNuke 2.3.0, as identified by Waraxe. This specific CVE is associated with the "Remote Detection of Local Files in captcha.php" vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an uninitialized array "aFonts" within the `captcha.php` script, combined with the PHP settings `register_globals=on` and `display_errors=on`. This allows an attacker to manipulate the application and trigger PHP error messages to determine if local files and directories exist on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability. By manipulating the `aFonts` parameter, the attacker can use the different error messages returned by the `imageftbbox()` PHP function to determine whether files and directories exist on the server. This allows the attacker to map out the server's filesystem.
- **Uninitialized Array:** The `captcha.php` script fails to properly initialize the `aFonts` array.
- **Reliance on PHP Settings:** The exploit relies on specific PHP settings (`register_globals=on` and `display_errors=on`), which are often discouraged for security reasons.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this vulnerability is considered low, as it does not directly lead to code execution or data modification. However, it can provide an attacker with valuable information about the server's file system, which can be used to plan further attacks.
- An attacker can detect the existence of sensitive files and directories, paving the way for further exploitation using other vulnerabilities if present in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `captcha.php` script.
- Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `aFonts[]` parameter in the URL, providing the path of the file/directory they want to probe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The exploit is more effective when `register_globals=on` and `display_errors=on` are set on the target server.

**Technical Details from Exploit-DB:**
- **Example Attack:**
  - `http://localhost/ravennuke230/images/captcha.php?aFonts[]=/etc/waraxe` (for a non-existent file)
  - `http://localhost/ravennuke230/images/captcha.php?aFonts[]=/etc/passwd` (for an existing file)
- **Error Message Analysis:**
  - "Invalid font filename" or "Could not find/open font" indicates that the file does not exist.
  - "Could not read font" indicates that the file exists.

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to RavenNuke version 2.30.01. The release note indicates that this version addresses this and other security vulnerabilities in the previous versions.
- Properly initialize the `aFonts` array before use to prevent this type of information leakage.
- Disable `register_globals` and `display_errors` to enhance the overall security of the PHP environment

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db entry mentions that multiple page refreshes might be needed because of source code specifics, this likely refers to how the application handles errors.
- The same vulnerability can potentially be used to detect the existence of remote directories, not just local files.
