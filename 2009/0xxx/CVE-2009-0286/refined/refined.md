```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `form_data[script_class]` parameter, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Directory Traversal"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the webserver has access to, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, or system files.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to `http://site/opengoo/public/upgrade/index.php` with the `form_data[script_class]` parameter containing directory traversal sequences and a target filename.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
