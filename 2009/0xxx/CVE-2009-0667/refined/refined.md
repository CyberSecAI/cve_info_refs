```
Root cause of vulnerability: The ocsinventory-agent includes the current directory (".") in its Perl module search path (@INC). When the agent is run by cron, it changes the current directory to "/". This causes the agent to scan all subdirectories from root for perl modules

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure module search path. By including "." in @INC, it allows arbitrary code execution if a malicious perl module is placed in any directory that the agent scans.

Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can create a malicious perl module which can be executed by the vulnerable agent, leading to complete compromise of the system. The vulnerability can also cause excessive traffic when the agent scans NFS mounts, affecting the availability of resources.

Attack vectors:
    - An attacker needs to place a specially crafted perl module on the filesystem which will be scanned by the agent.
    - The agent is started via cron, and the current directory is changed to `/` which causes the entire file system to be scanned.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to have write access to the filesystem of the vulnerable system to place a malicious perl module.
