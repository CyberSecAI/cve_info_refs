```
```
Package: ocsinventory-agent
Version: 1:0.0.9.2repack1-4
Severity: important

(Frankly I’m tempted to set the severity to critical given this will
actually break unrelated software.)

I was wondering what was causing 30 GB of traffic each morning on a
group of computers. I came out laughing nervously all around when I
discovered this is caused by the OCS agent.

The following code in Agent/Backend.pm is executed:
    foreach my $d (@INC) {
      next unless -d $d;
      File::Find::find( sub {
          push @installed_mod, $File::Find::name if $File::Find::name =~ /Ocsinventory\/Agent\/Backend\/.*\.pm$/;
          }
          , $d);
    }

Since @INC contains ".", this actually leads to a full scan of all
subdirectories from $pwd.

Guess what, the cron job chdirs to / before running the script. Not a
good idea when you have NFS mounts.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                 Nico Golde

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : ocsinventory-agent
Vulnerability  : insecure module search path
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 506416
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-0667

It was discovered that the ocsinventory-agent which is part of the
ocsinventory suite, a hardware and software configuration indexing service,
is prone to an insecure perl module search path.  As the agent is started
via cron and the current directory (/ in this case) is included in the
default perl module path the agent scans every directory on the system
for its perl modules.  This enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code
via a crafted ocsinventory-agent perl module placed on the system.

The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain ocsinventory-agent.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.0.9.2repack1-4lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.0.9.2repack1-5

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.0.9.2repack1-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your ocsinventory-agent packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

## About OCS inventory

**Open computers and software inventory** is an **asset management solution.**

It is an **open source** software. It allows you to **scan** and **inventory** all your devices in your IT Department. Once you know everything about your machines, on **hardware** and **software** sides, you can deploy **packages** to keep your environment **safe**. Many **plugins** are available and give high flexibility to fit OCS Inventory to your own system. [FactorFX](https://www.factorfx.com/) is the main contributor and daily edit the software. This french society guides companies in integrating and supporting OCS Inventory.

## specifics of solution

### Inventory management

Since 2001, **OCS Inventory** has been looking to make hardware and software inventory of computers more efficient. OCS Inventory queries its **agents** to know the **soft and hard composition** of each machine, each server. OCS Inventory also queries the network to discover the active elements that cannot receive an agent. Since version 2.0, OCS Inventory integrates the functionality of **SNMP scans**.

The main purpose of this integration is to complement the data collected by **ipdiscover.** Using SNMP scans will allow you to insert a lot of information about your network hardware: printers, switches, computers (which do not have an OCS agent installed), etc. SNMP scans will be performed by OCS agents based on IP addresses collected by ipdiscover.

### The remote deployment

**OCS Inventory** includes the **package deployment** feature, in order not to control, but to ensure uniformity of the software environments present on the network. From the central management server, you can upload the packets that will be downloaded using HTTP/HTTPS and launched by the **agent** on the client computer. OCS remote deployment is configurable so that sent packets impact the network’s quality of service as little as possible. OCS is used as a deployment tool on parks with **more than 150 000 machines**.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
