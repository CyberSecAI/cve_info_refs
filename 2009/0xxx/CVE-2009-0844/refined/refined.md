  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-0844",
    "description": "Multiple flaws were discovered in the Kerberos GSS-API and ASN.1 routines that did not correctly handle certain requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash services using the Kerberos library, leading to a denial of service.",
    "technical_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The MIT krb5 implementation of the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism can read beyond the end of a network input buffer.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer over-read in the `get_input_token()` function of the SPNEGO implementation.",
           "The length encoding of the input buffer allows for a value that exceeds the remaining bytes."
        ],
        "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause a GSS-API application to crash. Under extremely unlikely conditions, there may be a theoretical possibility of a small information disclosure.",
        "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a specially crafted network request to a service using the Kerberos GSS-API mechanism.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "No authentication required. Remote network access."
      },
      {
          "root_cause": "The `get_input_token()` function in the SPNEGO implementation can read beyond the end of a network input buffer.",
          "weaknesses": [
              "A length encoding that decodes to a value exceeding the number of remaining bytes in the input buffer will cause the function to copy memory past the end of the input buffer."
          ],
           "impact": "GSS-API application crash by reading from invalid address space, potentially leading to a small information leak (theoretical).",
