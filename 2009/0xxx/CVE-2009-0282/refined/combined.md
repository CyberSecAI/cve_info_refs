How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

(Archived at
<[http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2009-01/0167.html>.](http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2009-01/0167.html%3E.))

No CVE number appears to have been assigned to this yet.

Ralink's Linux drivers are based on their Windows drivers and the
following code in PeerProbeReqSanity() in the source file sanity.c
appears to have exactly this flaw:

    if ((pFrame->Octet[0] != IE_SSID) || (pFrame->Octet[1] > MAX_LEN_OF_SSID))
    {
        DBGPRINT(RT_DEBUG_TRACE, "PeerProbeReqSanity fail - wrong SSID IE(Type=%d,Len=%d)\n",pFrame->Octet[0],pFrame->Octet[1]);
        return FALSE;
    }

    *pSsidLen = pFrame->Octet[1];
    memcpy(Ssid, &pFrame->Octet[2], *pSsidLen);

pFrame->Octet is an array of signed char and MAX_LEN_OF_SSID expands
to a decimal literal which will have type int.  Therefore unsigned
values in the range [128, 255] will be treated as values in the range
[-128, -1] and will pass the test.

Similar code exists in the rt2400, rt2500, rt2570, rt61 and rt2860
drivers.

Ben.

I think it probably would, but I'm a bit wary of doing that.

I reviewed sanity.c in the Debian package (CVS snapshot from 2008-06-23
but I don't believe the driver has changed much) and I found only one
more case of signed/unsigned confusion.  My proposed patch is:

(The code for IE_QBSS_LOAD has a similar problem, but it's disabled by

# Multiple Ralink wireless drivers: Execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200907-08**

An integer overflow in multiple Ralink wireless drivers might lead to the
execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-wireless/rt2400** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.2.2\_beta3** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **net-wireless/rt2500** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.1.0\_pre2007071515** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **net-wireless/rt2570** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **20070209** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **net-wireless/rt61** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.1.0\_beta2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **net-wireless/ralink-rt61** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.1.1.0** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

All listed packages are external kernel modules that provide drivers
for multiple Ralink devices. ralink-rt61 is released by ralinktech.com,
the other packages by the rt2x00.serialmonkey.com project.

### Description

Aviv reported an integer overflow in multiple Ralink wireless card
drivers when processing a probe request packet with a long SSID,
possibly related to an integer signedness error.

### Impact

A physically proximate attacker could send specially crafted packets to
a user who has wireless networking enabled, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Workaround

Unload the kernel modules.

### Resolution

All external kernel modules have been masked and we recommend that
users unmerge those drivers. The Linux mainline kernel has equivalent
support for these devices and the vulnerability has been resolved in
stable versions of sys-kernel/gentoo-sources.

```
 # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt2400"
 # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt2500"
 # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt2570"
 # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/rt61"
 # emerge --unmerge "net-wireless/ralink-rt61"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian already distributes patches, are they upstream yet? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2009-02-04 16:57:48 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 257631](show_bug.cgi?id=257631 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - rt2400, rt2500 and rt2570 security vulns") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2009-02-04 16:59:32 UTC  ``` Yes, patches are in their advisories: <http://www.debian.org/security/2009/dsa-1712> <http://www.debian.org/security/2009/dsa-1713> <http://www.debian.org/security/2009/dsa-1714>  Changing to [ebuild]. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-02-04 17:32:10 UTC  ``` I do not have the hardware to test, so I won't be touching this. Anyone else, please bump (darkside?). ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-02-26 21:57:15 UTC  ``` ping, this is a rather serious issue... ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Jeremy Olexa (darkside) (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-02-26 22:09:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=257023#c4)) > I do not have the hardware to test, so I won't be touching this.

Sorry. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Steev Klimaszewski (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-03-11 16:42:46 UTC  ``` I do apologize for totally missing this bug until today - is there a way to maybe switch a security bug around to have something of note in the summary?  CVE would be nice (assuming one exists) - so that they stand out somehow.  Anyway - I've been using the in kernel rt2500usb since 2.26(I think) - I've always stated that the out of kernel would be going away when it was stable enough for use, however at the moment, I don't have any cards with me (I'm at work) - so I can't test a fix.  Most of my cards that are rt2x00 based require WEP or open access points, which I don't currently have access to.  I do have one rt2x00 card that CAN do WPA, I have not had a chance to look in to it though.  If you can find one near you, it is the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Wi-Fi_USB_Connector> .  You'd have to find it at a resell shop most likely.  To finish off the comment, I've always said that Security can fix any issue that creeps up without me getting upset.  Same in this case for any package I maintain. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-03-11 16:54:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=257023#c7)) > I do apologize for totally missing this bug until today - is there a way to > maybe switch a security bug around to have something of note in the summary?   It's in the "Gentoo Security" component. Bugzilla queries allow filtering for that, and it's in some X-header in bugmails if you use procmail or similar to filter.   > Anyway - I've been using the in kernel rt2500usb since 2.26(I think) - I've > always stated that the out of kernel would be going away when it was stable > enough for use, however at the moment, I don't have any cards with me (I'm at > work) - so I can't test a fix.

Well, no worries if it's going to take a few more days, but if you find the in-kernel support to be as complete as the extra modules, they sure can be kicked out.   ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-07-12 17:50:45 UTC  ``` GLSA 200907-08, this bug can be closed once they are gone. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Jeremy Olexa (darkside) (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-09-04 02:14:30 UTC  ``` all are gone ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-09-04 16:30:40 UTC  ``` Looks like we are finally done here.
