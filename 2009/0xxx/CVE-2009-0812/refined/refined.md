Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs when the Hex Workshop software processes a specially crafted .hex file. Specifically, when the software imports a .hex file, it copies data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. By providing a .hex file with excessively long data fields, an attacker can overwrite adjacent memory regions on the stack.
- **SEH Overwrite:** Several exploits target the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrite, allowing control of program execution when an exception is triggered.  The overwrite of the SEH record allows the attacker to redirect execution to shellcode.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The software does not validate the size of data fields within the .hex file before copying it into memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This means the attacker could gain full control of the system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** Since the vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted file, this vulnerability can also lead to privilege escalation if an attacker can trick a user into opening such file with elevated privileges, assuming the user has higher privileges than the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Import:** The attack vector is the import of a malicious `.hex` file into Hex Workshop. An attacker can create a malicious .hex file and trick a user into importing it through "File -> Import".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to get the malicious .hex file onto the victim's machine.  This could be achieved via social engineering, email attachments, shared drives, or other file transfer methods.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the victim to import or open the malicious .hex file using the vulnerable Hex Workshop software.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- Multiple versions of Hex Workshop are vulnerable (3.x, 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x).
- The exploit code provided demonstrates how to craft malicious .hex files for different versions of the software, adjusting the buffer overflow length and SEH overwrite address accordingly.
-  The shellcode used in the exploit is designed to execute the `calc.exe` program as a proof of concept, but can be replaced with any desired shellcode.
- Different stack addresses are provided in the exploits as stack addresses might change.
- There is a mention of "Data Sniper" and "Security^Ghost" as discoverers/exploiters.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description and gives a clear understanding of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
