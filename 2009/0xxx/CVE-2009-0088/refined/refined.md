Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2009-0088:

**Root Cause:**

- A stack corruption vulnerability exists in the way the WordPerfect 6.x converter, included with Microsoft Office Word 2000, processes memory when parsing a specially crafted WordPerfect document. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the converter validates the length of a string while parsing the document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack Corruption:** The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of string length within the WordPerfect 6.x converter. This could lead to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The converter doesn't properly validate the structure or content of the WordPerfect file before parsing it, leading to the memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **E-mail Attachments:** An attacker could send a specially crafted WordPerfect 6.x file to a user and trick them into opening it with Microsoft Office Word 2000.
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website with a malicious WordPerfect 6.x file.  A user could be tricked into clicking a link to the website, leading to exploitation. Compromised websites or sites with user-provided content could also host such malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafted Malicious File:** The attacker needs to create a specifically crafted WordPerfect 6.x document to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious file with the vulnerable software (Microsoft Office Word 2000). This could be through social engineering, tricking the user to click a link or open an attachment.
