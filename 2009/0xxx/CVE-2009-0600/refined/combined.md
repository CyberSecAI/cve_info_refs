Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0313)

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was
previously known as Ethereal.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark read
a malformed packet off a network or opened a malformed dump file, it could
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark.
(CVE-2008-4683, CVE-2009-0599)

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malformed dump file. (CVE-2008-4680, CVE-2008-4681, CVE-2008-4682,
CVE-2008-4684, CVE-2008-4685, CVE-2008-5285, CVE-2009-0600)

Users of wireshark should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Wireshark version 1.0.6, and resolve these issues. All running instances of
Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dhcp
By sending requests with a large value for 'dhcp-max-message-size'
dhcp-clients could crash dhcpd if dhcpd was configured with a large
amount of DHCP options (CVE-2007-0062).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ntp/xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
Packages for SLES10 got delayed due a fix for another problem and
will follow soon
- squid
A denial of service condition in HTTP-request processing
was fixed in squid (CVE-2009-0478).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- wireshark
wireshark could crash while reading capture files containing
NetScreen data (CVE-2009-0599), while reading Tektronix K12 capture
files (CVE-2009-0600) or if the HOME environment variable contained
format string specifiers (CVE-2009-0601).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libpng
Specially crafted png files could crash applications using libpng or
potentially execute arbitrary code by causing free of an
uninitialized pointer (CVE-2009-0040).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- pam\_mount
Temporary file handling of the passwdehd script was prone to symlink
attacks (CVE-2008-5138). In 11.0 and 11.1 the script was removed as
it doesn't work on those distributions anyways.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- enscript
long path names could overflow a buffer in enscript (CVE-2008-5078).
Affected Products: SLES9
- eID-belgium
eID-belgium didn't properly check the return value of the openssl
function EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0049).
Affected Products: SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-good
Specially crafted QuickTime media files could cause heap based
buffer overflows in gstreamer. Attackers could potentially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0386, CVE-2009-0387,

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## wnpa-sec-2009-01 · Multiple problems in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple problems in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2009-01

**Date:** February 6, 2009

**Affected versions:** 0.99.6 up to and including
1.0.5

**Fixed versions:** 1.0.6

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.0.6 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* On non-Windows systems, Wireshark could crash if the HOME environment
  variable contained sprintf-style string formatting characters. Discovered by
  babi.

  ([Bug
  3150](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3150))
  Versions affected: 0.99.8 to 1.0.5
  * Wireshark could crash while reading a malformed NetScreen snoop file.
    Discovered by babi.

    ([Bug
    3151](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3151))
    Versions affected: 0.99.7 to 1.0.5
    * Wireshark could crash while reading a Tektronix K12 text capture file.

      ([Bug
      1937](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1937))
      Versions affected: 0.99.6 to 1.0.5

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by altering the HOME environment
variable or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.0.6 or later.

If are running Wireshark {{ end\_version }} or earlier (including Ethereal 0.99.0) and cannot
upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above by doing the
following:

* For each user that will run Wireshark (including root if you're running
  Wireshark as a privileged user), make sure the HOME environment variable
  doesnt' contain any "%" characters.
* Don't open any Tektronix K12 text or NetScreen capture files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

wireshark security update (RHSA-2009-0313)

Original Release Date: March 11, 2009

Last Revised: March 11, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-082

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Wireshark is a program for monitoring network traffic. Wireshark was
previously known as Ethereal.

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark
read
a malformed packet off a network or opened a malformed dump file, it
could
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running
Wireshark.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2008-4683](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4683) and
[CVE-2009-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0599) to these issues.

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark
could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malformed dump file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names

## 2. Avaya System Products with wireshark installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | 3.x, 4.x, 5.x | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that
customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.
