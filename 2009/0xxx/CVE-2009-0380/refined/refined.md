Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0380

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `showbiz` task of the SOBI2 component for Mambo. Specifically, the `bid` parameter within the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database. The provided exploit demonstrates extraction of usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
- **Potential Data Modification:** Depending on the database user privileges, an attacker might be able to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable component.
- **Malicious URL Parameter:** The injected SQL code is placed in the `bid` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct malicious SQL queries to exploit the injection point.
- **Knowledge of application's URL structure:** attacker needs to know how to access the vulnerable component (`com_sobi2`) and task (`showbiz`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit provided in the content demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
- The vendor disputed the vulnerability according to one source but it was later confirmed and assigned CVE-2009-0380
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Mambo Component SOBI2 RC 2.8.2".
- The exploit was published on 2009-01-21.
