Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `bview.asp` file of ASPThai.Net WebBoard 6.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `id` parameter in the `bview.asp` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.
- The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database. This could lead to:
   - Retrieval of sensitive information such as user credentials (e.g., `useradmin` and `passadmin` from the `admin` table).
   - Manipulation of data within the database.
   - Potential compromise of the entire web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL with a malicious SQL injection payload within the `id` parameter of `bview.asp`.
- The provided exploit is: `bview.asp?id=1+union+select+0,useradmin,2,3,4,passadmin,6,7,8+from+admin`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or authentication are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter and how to craft the malicious SQL query to inject.
