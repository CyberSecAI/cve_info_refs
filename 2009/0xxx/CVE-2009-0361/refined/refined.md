{
  "CVE-2009-0361": {
    "Description": "The PAM module for the Heimdal Kerberos implementation allows reinitialisation of user credentials when run from a setuid context, resulting in potential local denial of service by overwriting the credential cache file or to local privilege escalation.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of reinitialization of user credentials within a setuid context.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "The PAM module allows reinitialization of user credentials when run from a setuid context.",
       "When pam_setcred is called with PAM_REINITIALIZE_CREDS or PAM_REFRESH_CREDS it uses the existing KRB5CCNAME environment variable to locate the Kerberos credential cache.",
      "The module doesn't drop privileges or call PAM_ESTABLISH_CREDS before reinitializing credentials in a setuid context."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local denial of service by overwriting the credential cache file, or local privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker, exploiting setuid applications.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user who can execute setuid applications that use the vulnerable PAM module."
