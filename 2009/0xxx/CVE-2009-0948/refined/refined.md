Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2009-0948:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple buffer overflows within the CDF (Common Document Format) parsing implementation in `file` version 5.00.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Specifically, the buffer overflows occur in the following functions:
    *   `cdf_read_sat()`
    *   `cdf_read_long_sector_chain()`
    *   `cdf_read_ssat()`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The exploitation of these buffer overflows can lead to memory corruption. The provided text also mentions that there were other related memory corruption issues and DoS attacks using looping sector chains that were fixed around the same time.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the processing of specially crafted CDF files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious CDF file to be processed by the vulnerable `file` utility (version 5.00).

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is specific to `file` version 5.00 due to the introduction of CDF support in that version.
* Fedora 11 was affected by this vulnerability.
* The issues were fixed in `file` version 5.02.
* A patch from Apple was also mentioned as a proposed fix.
