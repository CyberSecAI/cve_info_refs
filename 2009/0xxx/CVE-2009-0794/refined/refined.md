Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `PulseAudioSourceDataLine.java` and `PulseAudioTargetDataLine.java` classes within the IcedTea project's PulseAudio integration for Java. Specifically, the issue occurs when handling the 'length' parameter in the `write` and `read` methods of these classes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is that the code did not properly validate the 'length' parameter leading to an integer overflow condition.  This could occur if a negative length was provided or if length + offset resulted in an out-of-bounds access.
*   **Lack of Proper Bounds Checking:**  The initial code used `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` but the root cause was an improper argument validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this integer overflow to cause a crash in a Java applet. Specifically, the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` could lead to the termination of the applet or application which would result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Applet:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious Java applet or application that could manipulate the ‘length’ parameter when using the PulseAudio integration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute a Java applet or application that uses the vulnerable PulseAudio classes. This could be a remote attacker through a web browser running a malicious Java applet or a local attacker running a compromised application. The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the length parameter being used in the vulnerable code paths.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involved changing the exception thrown for negative lengths from `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` to `IllegalArgumentException` in the `write()` method of `PulseAudioSourceDataLine.java`.
*   The `read()` method in `PulseAudioTargetDataLine.java` had its bounds checking corrected to throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when the offset was negative or greater than the buffer's available space.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in `java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-0.25.b09.fc9` for Fedora 9 and `java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-15.b14.fc10` for Fedora 10, which shows it was a problem in the openjdk package used in these distributions.
