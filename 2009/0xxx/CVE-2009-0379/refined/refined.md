Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0379

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `com_pcchess` component of Joomla!, specifically affecting the `game_id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly reveal SQL error messages, making it a "blind" injection. Attackers need to infer information based on changes in response times or content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  The provided exploit code demonstrates the ability to extract sensitive information from the `jos_users` table, including usernames and passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access to the Joomla! application and potentially the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via HTTP requests. The attacker crafts a malicious URL by manipulating the `game_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application. They do not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability lies in a publicly accessible component.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit code leverages the fact that the application responds differently based on whether a given SQL condition is true or false, even without showing SQL errors. This is achieved by sending queries like `... and 1=1--` (always true) and `... and 1=0--` (always false) and observing the difference in the length of the response.
- The code then performs a character-by-character extraction of usernames and passwords by injecting SQL queries like `... and ascii(substring((select username from jos_users limit 0,1),<position>,1))> <ascii_value>--`.
- The exploit script is written in PHP. It takes the vulnerable URL as an argument.
