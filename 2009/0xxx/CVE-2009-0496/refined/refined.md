Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities present in various parameters of different JSP pages within Ignite Realtime Openfire.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
    *   Specific vulnerable parameters and JSP pages include:
        *   `log` parameter in `logviewer.jsp` and `log.jsp`
        *   `search` parameter in `group-summary.jsp`
        *   `username` parameter in `user-properties.jsp`
        *   `logDir`, `maxTotalSize`, `maxFileSize`, `maxDays`, and `logTimeout` parameters in `audit-policy.jsp`
        *    `propName` parameter in `server-properties.jsp`
        *   `roomconfig_roomname` and `roomconfig_roomdesc` parameters in `muc-room-edit-form.jsp`
*  **Secondary Vulnerability**:  XSS can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution via malicious plugin upload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most significant impact is the ability to achieve remote arbitrary code execution on the server running the Openfire application. This is achieved by using the XSS vulnerabilities to upload a malicious Java plugin.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The XSS vulnerabilities can also lead to information disclosure through the injection of malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Enticement:** Attackers can entice users to visit a malicious server or use malicious data to trigger the XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Malicious Plugin Upload:** Exploitation involves using XSS to upload a malicious plugin to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the Openfire server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameters in the various JSP pages.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious XSS payloads and a malicious plugin to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report on gentoo.org also mentions CVE-2009-0497, which is a directory traversal vulnerability in the same software. This CVE is a separate but related vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Openfire version 3.6.3
*   Gentoo users were advised to upgrade to version 3.6.3
*   The issue was reported on 2009-01-09 and resolved by 2009-04-02
