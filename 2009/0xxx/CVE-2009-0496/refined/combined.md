How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2009-01-09 13:26:07 UTC  ``` From the advisory:  Openfire is a real time collaboration (RTC) server licensed under the Open Source GPL. It uses the widely adopted open protocol for instant messaging XMPP, also called Jabber. Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been found, which may lead to arbitrary remote code execution on the server running the application due to unauthorized upload of Java plugin code. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-01-09 14:42:50 UTC  ``` It's still XSS based. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2009-01-09 15:26:49 UTC  ``` But "Remote passive compromise: remote execution of arbitrary code by enticing a user to visit a malicious server or using malicious data" fits. ;P  ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-01-13 12:42:51 UTC  ``` +*openfire-3.6.3 (13 Jan 2009) + +  13 Jan 2009; Robert Buchholz <rbu@gentoo.org> -openfire-3.5.2.ebuild, +  -openfire-3.6.0.ebuild, -openfire-3.6.0a.ebuild, +openfire-3.6.3.ebuild: +  Proxy commit for jokey: Version bump ([bug #248857](show_bug.cgi?id=248857 "RESOLVED FIXED - net-im/openfire 3.6.2 out")) for security bug (#254309) +  fixing a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability that can be exploited to execute +  arbitrary code on the server.
