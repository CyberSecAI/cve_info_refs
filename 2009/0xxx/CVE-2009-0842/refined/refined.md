    "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The 'mapserv' CGI program can be made to leak sensitive information in files if an attacker has access to create symlinks anywhere in the file system.  The program does not verify the file type and attempts to parse the file, resulting in an error message that discloses file content.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "File type verification is missing during map file parsing.",
             "The application discloses file contents in error messages."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information from arbitrary files on the server by creating a symbolic link to it and referencing this link as a map file. The file contents are revealed through error messages.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "The attacker needs to create a symlink to a sensitive file on the server.",
            "The attacker accesses the 'mapserv' CGI program with the symlink path as the map file."
        ],
         "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links on the server file system, which typically requires some level of access or a pre-existing vulnerability. The attacker also needs to know the location of the MapServer CGI script."
