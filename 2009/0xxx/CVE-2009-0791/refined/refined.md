Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue is an integer overflow in the `gmalloc` function calls within the `xpdf` and `poppler` libraries. Specifically, the size argument passed to `gmalloc` was calculated by multiplying values read from a PDF file. If these values were manipulated in a malicious PDF, the multiplication could result in an integer overflow, leading to the allocation of an undersized buffer.
*   Additionally, there is a missing check for allocation failures, which can lead to null pointer dereferences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is the integer overflow during the calculation of the buffer size for memory allocation.
*   **Missing Allocation Check:** The code lacks proper checks for `gmalloc` failing and returning NULL, potentially causing a null pointer dereference when the allocated memory is used.
*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** When combined, the undersized buffer and a missing allocation check can cause heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause a crash of the application due to a heap overflow or null pointer dereference.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In some instances, with carefully crafted input, the vulnerability *could potentially* lead to arbitrary code execution. However, most descriptions emphasize the crash as the primary impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted PDF file designed to exploit the integer overflow during memory allocation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted PDF:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file with specific values designed to trigger the integer overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious PDF using a vulnerable application like `xpdf`, `kpdf`, `gpdf`, or `cups` using the vulnerable `pdftops` filter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `Splash::drawImage` function was specifically noted to be vulnerable. Other areas affected include `ObjectStream::ObjectStream`, `PSOutputDev::doImageL1Sep`, and `ImageStream::ImageStream`.
*   The `gmallocn` function is used as a fix, with a detailed explanation of why the overflow occurs in `gmaloc` usage.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in various Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases through security updates and errata.
*   Upstream fixes were provided for xpdf and poppler.
*   The vulnerability is present in different forks of xpdf, including those used in CUPS.
