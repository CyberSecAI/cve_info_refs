How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=526911#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-02 13:30:23 UTC  ``` Adam Zabrocki reported flaws in xpdf's Splash::drawImage function related to buffer memory allocations:  2220   // allocate pixel buffers 2221   colorBuf = (SplashColorPtr)gmalloc((yp + 1) * w * nComps); 2222   if (srcAlpha) { 2223     alphaBuf = (Guchar *)gmalloc((yp + 1) * w); 2224   } else { 2225     alphaBuf = NULL; 2226   }  Values used to compute argument passed to gmalloc come from input PDF file.  Properly chosen values will cause gmalloc to return NULL or buffer of insufficient size, leading to NULL pointer dereference or heap buffer overflow later.  Affected Splash output device is not available in xpdf 2.x versions and earlier.  It is also not used in xpdf embedded in CUPS or tetex.  This was already fixed in poppler as part of preventive gmalloc -> gmallocn changes: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=9cf2325fb2>  This fix is also present in the EL5 poppler packages.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=526911#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-02 13:48:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 363485](attachment.cgi?id=363485&action=diff "xpdf upstream patch from Derek B.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

An updated xpdf package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Xpdf is an X Window System based viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files.

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in Xpdf. An attacker could
create a malicious PDF file that would cause Xpdf to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-1188,
CVE-2009-3604, CVE-2009-3606, CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting the CVE-2009-3604
issue, and Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608 issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
backported patch to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-03-24 12:22:57 UTC  ``` The CUPS "pdftops" filter converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files into PostScript. It is based upon Xpdf and the CUPS imaging library.  Multiple integer overflows, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were found in the CUPS "pdftops" filter. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause "pdftops" to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the "lp" user if the file was printed.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-03 15:54:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1083 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1083.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2009-06-03 16:34:48 UTC  ``` Patch for this issue fixes all cases where gmalloc is called with argument consisting of multiplication of multiple values (such as gmalloc(a*b)).  If one of the values is read from input file and is not previously checked, multiplication operation may overflow resulting in the insufficient memory allocation.  All such calls were replaced with use of gmallocn (i.e. gmallocn(a,b)).  Most of those changes were done in the xpdf code base in version 3.  Part of the patch is applicable and was applied to CUPS version shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  However, none of those changes has security implications or may not even be triggerable.  Detailed analysis of the cases addressed in RHEL5 patch:   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/Decrypt.cxx -  buf = (Guchar *)gmalloc(72 + fileID->getLength()); +  buf = (Guchar *)gmallocCn(72, 1, fileID->getLength());  This is basically "strlen(something-already-in-memory) + very-small-constant".  With such a small constant, it's very unlikely large enough input can be placed into memory and actually trigger an overflow, as it would require input of size very close to the addressable memory size limit.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/FoFiTrueType.cxx -  tableDir = (char *)gmalloc(12 + nNewTables * 16); +  tableDir = (char *)gmallocCn(12, nNewTables, 16);  Few lines above, there is:    newTables = (TrueTypeTable *)gmallocn(nNewTables, sizeof(TrueTypeTable));  where TrueTypeTable is:    struct TrueTypeTable {     Guint tag;     Guint checksum;     int offset;     int origOffset;     int len;   };  so 20 bytes on all our platforms.  If nNewTables is large enough to int overflow on "12 + nNewTables * 16", it is large enough to overflow in the mentioned gmallocn call above and cause abort there.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/gmem.c -  s1 = (char *)gmalloc(strlen(s) + 1); +  s1 = (char *)gmallocCn(1, 1, strlen(s));  "strlen(something-already-in-memory) + very-small-constant" case again.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/JBIG2Stream.cxx -  data = (Guchar *)gmalloc(h * line + 1); +  data = (Guchar *)gmallocCn(1, h, line);  -  data = (Guchar *)gmalloc(h * line + 1); +  data = (Guchar *)gmallocCn(1, h, line);  There is already an int overflow check right above those two gmalloc calls:    if (w <= 0 || h <= 0 || line <= 0 || h >= (INT_MAX - 1) / line) {     // force a call to gmalloc(-1), which will throw an exception     h = -1;     line = 2;   }  This check was added as part of the JBIG issues security patch.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/PSOutputDev.cxx -  lineBuf = (Guchar *)gmalloc(4 * width); +  lineBuf = (Guchar *)gmallocn(4, width);  Affected function can only be reached, when psLevel1Sep PostScript language level is used. Looking into pdftops, it defaults to psLevel2 and can switch to psLevel1 if PPD says so.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-13 08:52:41 UTC  ``` Those unsafe gmalloc uses are not specific to xpdf fork used by CUPS, similar problems affects other Xpdf versions / forks too.  These issues were already addressed in CUPS in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 (see [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c12)) and none of them has any security impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (see [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c13)).  Patch hardening gmalloc use was applied to poppler packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via:   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0480.html>  Other packages including xpdf code base will have this preventive patch applied in the future updates.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:26:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1502 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1502.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:34:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1501 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1501.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:37:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1500 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1500.html>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:48:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1503 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1503.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 09:06:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1512 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1512.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c30)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-02 16:08:38 UTC  ``` Note: [CVE-2009-3605](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3605) is duplicate for the same unsafe gmalloc use in xpdf / poppler code.   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 18:53:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0399 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0399.html>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 19:09:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0400 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0400.html>   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c36)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 19:10:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2010:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0401.html>   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1503)

## Topic

An updated gpdf package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

GPdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in GPdf. An attacker could
create a malicious PDF file that would cause GPdf to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-1188,
CVE-2009-3604, CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting the CVE-2009-3604
issue, and Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608 issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
backported patch to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=526877#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-02 09:22:30 UTC  ``` xpdf's PSOutputDev::doImageL1Sep contains an integer overflow in the lineBuf buffer allocation:  4303   // allocate a line buffer 4304   lineBuf = (Guchar *)gmalloc(4 * width);  width is read from the input PDF file and can integer overflow / wrap when multiplied by 4, resulting in an insufficient memory allocation, leading to heap overflow.  Impact of this flaw is, however, quite limited.  This affects PSOutputDev class used to write / convert PDF input to PS (PostScript) output.  For GUI viewers, this is done e.g. when trying to print the file.  Additionally, this requires non-default Level 1 separable PostScript language level to be used for the output file (specified via e.g. -level1sep command line option for pdftops, or psLevel configuration option in xpdfrc).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=526877#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-02 09:46:14 UTC  ``` This code is present even in xpdf 0.9x versions, so is likely to be used in other applications forking or embedding xpdf.  Current upstream xpdf version 3.02pl3 is affected, as well as xpdf versions shipped in EL3 and EL4.   poppler has this problem fixed already and uses gmallocn.  This was fixed in the last round of xpdf fixes earlier this year as preventive fix, while other integer overflow fixes were addressed.  Upstream commit:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/diff/poppler/PSOutputDev.cc?id=7b2d314a61>  This patch is already used in the latest poppler packages version in EL5 and gpdf version in EL4.   CUPS does contain this code, but it is not reachable, as pdftops in CUPS never uses level1Sep PS level.  It initializes level as:  119   level  = psLevel2;  and later possibly changes that based on the info from the PPD file:  143     level = ppd->language_level == 1 ? psLevel1 : psLevel2;  Even though pdftops in CUPS reads xpdfrc-like configuration file pdftops.conf, PS output level is always set to one of the above values after reading the configuration file.  Additionally, latest CUPS packages in EL3 and EL4 have this changed to use gmallocn.   kdegraphics' kpdf program only contains PSOutputDev in the version shipped in EL5 and is used to convert PDF to PS for printing.  kpdf does not change PS level from the default level2.  However, it does read xpdfrc configuration file used by xpdf.  Additionally, it is affected by the problem as described here:  <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=242930>  GlobalParams::GlobalParams tries to read an xpdfrc file, either one specified as its argument (kpdf passes empty string), user's local ~/.xpdfrc (xpdfUserConfigFile) or global xpdfc (xpdfUserConfigFile).  But as SYSTEM_XPDFRC is not defined, kpdf tries to open (global) xpdfrc from the current directory, instead of the expected /etc/xpdfrc.  Unlike Gentoo's xpdf case, kpdf does not seem to process xpdfrc options than can lead to command execution (psFile, urlCommand, movieCommand), so does not offer a way to execute commands without exploiting some other flaw.  We should still fix this in the next kdegraphics update, possibly by completely removing an attempt to read global xpdfrc, as that never worked for kpdf.   xpdf copy embedded in tetex contains this code too, I've not looked yet if it may be reachable though.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=526877#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-15 06:54:05 UTC  ``` Fixed now in xpdf 3.02pl4:   ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02pl4.patch   [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=526637#c14](show_bug.cgi?id=526637#c14 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-3608 xpdf/poppler: integer overflow in ObjectStream::ObjectStream (oCERT-2009-016)")   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=526877#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:26:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1502 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1502.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=526877#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:34:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1501 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1501.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=526877#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:37:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1500 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1500.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=526877#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-21 00:47:41 UTC  ``` xpdf-3.02-15.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

## Synopsis

Important: kdegraphics security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1502)

## Topic

Updated kdegraphics packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop
Environment, including KPDF, a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files.

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in KPDF. An attacker could
create a malicious PDF file that would cause KPDF to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-1188,
CVE-2009-3604, CVE-2009-3606, CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting the CVE-2009-3604
issue, and Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608 issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-03-24 12:22:57 UTC  ``` The CUPS "pdftops" filter converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files into PostScript. It is based upon Xpdf and the CUPS imaging library.  Multiple integer overflows, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were found in the CUPS "pdftops" filter. An attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause "pdftops" to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the "lp" user if the file was printed.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-03 15:54:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1083 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1083.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2009-06-03 16:34:48 UTC  ``` Patch for this issue fixes all cases where gmalloc is called with argument consisting of multiplication of multiple values (such as gmalloc(a*b)).  If one of the values is read from input file and is not previously checked, multiplication operation may overflow resulting in the insufficient memory allocation.  All such calls were replaced with use of gmallocn (i.e. gmallocn(a,b)).  Most of those changes were done in the xpdf code base in version 3.  Part of the patch is applicable and was applied to CUPS version shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  However, none of those changes has security implications or may not even be triggerable.  Detailed analysis of the cases addressed in RHEL5 patch:   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/Decrypt.cxx -  buf = (Guchar *)gmalloc(72 + fileID->getLength()); +  buf = (Guchar *)gmallocCn(72, 1, fileID->getLength());  This is basically "strlen(something-already-in-memory) + very-small-constant".  With such a small constant, it's very unlikely large enough input can be placed into memory and actually trigger an overflow, as it would require input of size very close to the addressable memory size limit.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/FoFiTrueType.cxx -  tableDir = (char *)gmalloc(12 + nNewTables * 16); +  tableDir = (char *)gmallocCn(12, nNewTables, 16);  Few lines above, there is:    newTables = (TrueTypeTable *)gmallocn(nNewTables, sizeof(TrueTypeTable));  where TrueTypeTable is:    struct TrueTypeTable {     Guint tag;     Guint checksum;     int offset;     int origOffset;     int len;   };  so 20 bytes on all our platforms.  If nNewTables is large enough to int overflow on "12 + nNewTables * 16", it is large enough to overflow in the mentioned gmallocn call above and cause abort there.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/gmem.c -  s1 = (char *)gmalloc(strlen(s) + 1); +  s1 = (char *)gmallocCn(1, 1, strlen(s));  "strlen(something-already-in-memory) + very-small-constant" case again.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/JBIG2Stream.cxx -  data = (Guchar *)gmalloc(h * line + 1); +  data = (Guchar *)gmallocCn(1, h, line);  -  data = (Guchar *)gmalloc(h * line + 1); +  data = (Guchar *)gmallocCn(1, h, line);  There is already an int overflow check right above those two gmalloc calls:    if (w <= 0 || h <= 0 || line <= 0 || h >= (INT_MAX - 1) / line) {     // force a call to gmalloc(-1), which will throw an exception     h = -1;     line = 2;   }  This check was added as part of the JBIG issues security patch.   +++ cups-1.3.7/pdftops/PSOutputDev.cxx -  lineBuf = (Guchar *)gmalloc(4 * width); +  lineBuf = (Guchar *)gmallocn(4, width);  Affected function can only be reached, when psLevel1Sep PostScript language level is used. Looking into pdftops, it defaults to psLevel2 and can switch to psLevel1 if PPD says so.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-13 08:52:41 UTC  ``` Those unsafe gmalloc uses are not specific to xpdf fork used by CUPS, similar problems affects other Xpdf versions / forks too.  These issues were already addressed in CUPS in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 (see [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c12)) and none of them has any security impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (see [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c13)).  Patch hardening gmalloc use was applied to poppler packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via:   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0480.html>  Other packages including xpdf code base will have this preventive patch applied in the future updates.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:26:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1502 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1502.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:34:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1501 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1501.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:37:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1500 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1500.html>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c27)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 08:48:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1503 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1503.html>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-10-15 09:06:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1512 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1512.html>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c30)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-02 16:08:38 UTC  ``` Note: [CVE-2009-3605](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3605) is duplicate for the same unsafe gmalloc use in xpdf / poppler code.   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c34)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 18:53:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2010:0399 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0399.html>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 19:09:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0400 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0400.html>   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=491840#c36)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-05-06 19:10:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2010:0401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0401.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A malicious PDF file could cause poppler to execute with permissions of the user calling the library.  Will Dormann of the CERT/CC created the extensive testsuite for the JBIG2 decoder in various PDF libraries that found this flaw.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Will Dormann of the CERT/CC for responsibly reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=495907#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-24 07:16:09 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-1188: Integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoding feature in Poppler before 0.10.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to SplashBitmap (splash/SplashBitmap.cc).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=495907#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-05-13 14:32:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0480 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0480.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=495907#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-15 07:44:34 UTC  ``` Patch previously applied to poppeler did not check for overflow when computing rowSize (see [bug #526915](show_bug.cgi?id=526915 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-3603 xpdf/poppler: SplashBitmap::SplashBitmap integer overflow")).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Synopsis

Important: xpdf security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated xpdf package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Xpdf is an X Window System based viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)

execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-3604,
CVE-2009-3606, CVE-2009-3609)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting the CVE-2009-3604
issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
backported patch to correct these issues.

## Solution

## Topic

Updated kdegraphics packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kdegraphics packages contain applications for the K Desktop
Environment, including KPDF, a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files.

Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in KPDF. An attacker could
create a malicious PDF file that would cause KPDF to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code when opened. (CVE-2009-0791, CVE-2009-1188,
CVE-2009-3604, CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)

Red Hat would like to thank Adam Zabrocki for reporting the CVE-2009-3604
issue, and Chris Rohlf for reporting the CVE-2009-3608 issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
