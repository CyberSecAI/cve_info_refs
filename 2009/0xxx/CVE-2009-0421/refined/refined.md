Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0421:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the Joomla! com_Eventing component versions 1.6.x.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly output the results of the SQL query, making it necessary to infer information by observing the application's behavior, in this case, by differences in response length.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database such as usernames and passwords.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via HTTP GET requests. The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries appended to the URL parameters.
- The provided exploit targets the `catid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or privileges.

**Additional details from the provided exploit code:**
- The exploit code demonstrates how to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table using the blind SQL injection vulnerability. It uses a character-by-character extraction method by observing the length of the HTTP response.
- The exploit attempts to bypass some common characters in the ASCII range.
- The exploit targets the first user from the table (`limit 0,1`).
