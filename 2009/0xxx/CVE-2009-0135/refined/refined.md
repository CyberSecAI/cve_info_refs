{
  "CVE-2009-0135": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in the Audible::Tag::readTag function in metadata/audible/audibletag.cpp in Amarok 1.4.10 through 2.0.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an Audible Audio (.aa) file with a large (1) nlen or (2) vlen Tag value, each of which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflows when reading the tag length ('nlen' and 'vlen') from a malformed Audible audio file. The large values cause a small memory allocation and subsequent buffer overflows when reading the tag data using the same length values.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflows",
      "Heap-based buffer overflows",
      "Unchecked memory allocations"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution by overwriting heap memory with attacker-controlled data. A denial of service is also possible",
    "Attack vectors": "By enticing a user to open a specially crafted Audible Audio (.aa) file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create a malformed Audible audio file with large 'nlen' or 'vlen' tag values."
