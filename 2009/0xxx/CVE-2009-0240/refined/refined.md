  "CVE-2009-0240": {
    "description": "WebSVN 2.0 does not properly implement access control checks, allowing authenticated users to access files with known paths. Specifically, listing.php does not properly enforce access restrictions when using an SVN authz file to authenticate users. This allows a remote attacker to read changelogs or diffs for restricted projects via a modified repname parameter.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control enforcement within the `listing.php` file when using an SVN authz file for authentication.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
         "Directory traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read changelogs or diffs for repositories they should not have access to, which leads to information disclosure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attack",
        "Manipulating the `repname` parameter in the URL."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to at least one repository handled by the vulnerable WebSVN instance.",
     "additional_information": "The issue stems from how WebSVN handles repository names in URLs, which allows an attacker to bypass permission checks by altering the `repname` parameter to access restricted repositories.  The fix involves backporting changes from upstream Subversion to restrict visible entries and log messages based on authentication, and properly check permissions for subfolders."
