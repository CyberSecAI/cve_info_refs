Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable, Beta update: Yahoo! Mail and Security Fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2009/01/stable-beta-update-yahoo-mail-and.html "Stable, Beta update: Yahoo! Mail and Security Fixes")

Wednesday, January 28, 2009

Google Chrome's Beta and Stable channels have been updated to 1.0.154.46. (Note, we won't have a different release for the Beta channel until we have something Beta-worthy come out of the Dev channel in February.)
This release fixes issues with two popular webmail providers:

* Sending mail from Yahoo! Mail works again.
* Windows Live Hotmail now works. While the Hotmail team works on a proper fix, we're deploying a workaround that changes the user agent string that Google Chrome sends when requesting URLs that end with mail.live.com.

  If you've been using the --user-agent switch to use Hotmail, you can remove the switch from your shortcuts with this release.

This release also includes two security updates. The [release notes](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/getting-involved/dev-channel/release-notes) have the full list of changes.
**Security Updates**
> **Work around for "Adobe Reader Plugin Open Parameters Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability"** CVE: CVE-2007-0048, CVE-2007-0045Google Chrome now refuses requests for javascript: URLs in Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI) requests from the Adobe Reader plugin. Adobe is aware of this issue and has helped us develop this mitigation while they work on a fix for all users.
> **Severity**: Moderate. This could allow a PDF document to run scripts on arbitrary sites.**Credit**: Thanks to Michael Schmidt for reporting this responsibly to Google.
> **Javascript Same-Origin Bypass**CVE: CVE-2009-0276A bug in the V8 JavaScript engine could allow bypassing same-origin checks in certain situations.
> **Severity**: High. A malicious script in a page could read the full URL of another frame, and possibly other attributes or data from another frame in a different origin. This could disclose sensitive information from one website to a third party.**Credit**: Found internally by Google.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
