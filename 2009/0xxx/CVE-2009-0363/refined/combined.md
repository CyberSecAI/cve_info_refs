| [493](#L493) | \* Don't fail silently when sourcing a file; actually let the user know. - asedeno |
| [494](#L494) | \* Only hang for 1s, rather than 10s, if there is no zhm - nelhage |
| [495](#L495) | \* Merge the unicode branch to trunk. BarnOwl is now unicode aware |
| [496](#L496) | and can send, receive, input and display UTF-8 encoded |
| [497](#L497) | messages. Unicode changelog: |
| [498](#L498) | \* Put glib's CFLAGS and LDFLAGS at the beginning of the corresponding |
| [499](#L499) | variables. - nelhage |

| [509](#L509) | \* fix a parsing issue for attributes - asedeno |
| [510](#L510) | \* Better compliance with UTF-8 processing. Stop trying |
| [511](#L511) | to pull in a UTF-8 character as soon as we know something has gone |
| [512](#L512) | wrong. - asedeno |
| [513](#L513) | \* Removing more hackery I left behind after doing things |
| [514](#L514) | the right way. - asedeno |
| [515](#L515) | \* editwin.c - fix a wrapping bug I introduced in the |
| [516](#L516) | last revision. It could leave us with a buffer that was not valid UTF- |
| [517](#L517) | 8 - asedeno |
| [518](#L518) | \* editwin.c - lots of utf-8 cleanup that I had been |
| [519](#L519) | putting off. util.c - a can we break here'' function based on perl's |
| [520](#L520) | Text::WrapI18N - asedeno |
| [521](#L521) | \* Remove more bad hacks. - asedeno |
| [522](#L522) | \* Remove a debug message I accidentally left in. Remove |
| [523](#L523) | the hours old check\_utf8 hackery in favor of actually marking strings as |
| [524](#L524) | UTF-8 from the C side. - asedeno |
| [525](#L525) | \* editwin.c: make locktext deal with UTF-8 |
| [526](#L526) | \* Jabber - More utf-8 sanitizing. |
| [527](#L527) | \* Pet peeve - tabs. That should be the end of it for |
| [528](#L528) | now. - asedeno |
| [529](#L529) | \* Shuffling a line of code to where it actually should |
| [530](#L530) | be. - asedeno |
| [531](#L531) | \* Patches to jabber libraries for better UTF-8 |
| [532](#L532) | handling. - asedeno |

| [535](#L535) | \* Eliminating a warning by un-internalizing a new fmtext |
| [536](#L536) | function. - asedeno |
| [537](#L537) | \* Do not use bit 0x80 to indicate meta. We have other uses for that bit. |
| [538](#L538) | \* shift it above ncurses's KEY\_MAX instead. - asedeno |
| [539](#L539) | \* drop unused struct member |
| [540](#L540) | \* fixing post-processing in the editwin. - asedeno |
| [541](#L541) | \* Preserve colors when highlighting search terms. - asedeno |
| [542](#L542) | \* ignore KEY\_RESIZE if we know what that is. We don't need an |
| [543](#L543) | unhandled keypress every time we resize the terminal. - asedeno |
| [544](#L544) | \* more strict utf-8 byte fetching. |
| [545](#L545) | This probably still needs more work. - asedeno |
| [546](#L546) | \* Strip formmating characters when dumping to |
| [547](#L547) | file. - asedeno |
| [548](#L548) | \* fixing bugs in editwin bufflen calculations. - asedeno |
| [549](#L549) | \* Fix search code so higlighting actually works. - asedeno |

| [557](#L557) | \* Fixing bug encountered when last field was not null- |
| [558](#L558) | terminated. - asedeno |
| [559](#L559) | \* First pass at incoming zephyr -> UTF-8 sanitizing. |
| [560](#L560) | This only operates on incoming data so far. We still need to clean outgoing |
| [561](#L561) | data -- the plan is to attempt conversion to ISO-8859-1, and use that if it |
| [562](#L562) | works. - asedeno |
| [563](#L563) | \* Reworked the fmtext format to use in-line formatting.  Characters used |
| [564](#L564) | for formatting are part of Unicode Supplemental Private Area-B, or |
| [565](#L565) | Plane 16. |
| [566](#L566) | \* include wchar.h |
| [567](#L567) | \* replace hand-rolled width detection with wcswidth. |
| [568](#L568) | \* pad with space if we end up halfway into a character at the start of a line. |
| [569](#L569) | \* UTF-8 - first pass |
| [570](#L570) | \* make owl\_text\_truncate\_cols() and owl\_fmtext\_truncate\_cols() understand character width. |
| [571](#L571) | This may need more work. Some code duplication - see if we can refactor. |
| [572](#L572) | \* stristr() rewritten to yse g\_utf\_casefold() instead of downstr(), and restructured to have a single return. |
| [573](#L573) | \* only\_whitespace() rewritten for unicode. |
| [574](#L574) | \* Fix sending jabbers to JIDs beginning with `+' - nelhage |
| [575](#L575) | \* Compile zcrypt.c with -w so I don't get all these warnings in my compile |
| [576](#L576) | output whenever I change any headers - nelhage |
| [577](#L577) | \* Implement /me for outgoing IRC messages - geofft |
| [578](#L578) | \* Add a makefile rule to support emacs flymake-mode - nelhage |

| [580](#L580) | terminals, too] - nelhage |
| [581](#L581) | \* avoid null pointer dereference if msg is NULL (or a 0 length is |
| [582](#L582) | claimed) - shadow |

| [584](#L584) | perl object interface. - nelhage |
| [585](#L585) | \* Refactor default style code somewhat to be more easily extensible - nelhage |
| [586](#L586) | \* Put glib's CFLAGS and LDFLAGS at the beginning of the corresponding |
| [587](#L587) | variables. - nelhage |

| [593](#L593) | \* Remove prototypes from perlwrap.pm - nelhage |
| [594](#L594) | \* Quote regexp filter elements with spaces in them. - asedeno |
| [595](#L595) | \* Deal with smart-narrowing when the user's screenname has spaces in it. - asedeno |
| [596](#L596) | \* Add a new struct member to the global to hold an escaped aim screenname. |
| [597](#L597) | populate the aforementioned new struct member. - asedeno |
| [598](#L598) | \* Removed our debian subdirectory, per Debian guidelines, at broder's |
| [599](#L599) | request. - geofft |
| [600](#L600) | \* Make `all' the first target so we build the modules by default - nelhage |

| [602](#L602) | \* updating contributors - nelhage |
| [603](#L603) | \* Clean up licensing information and add a COPYING file - nelhage |
| [604](#L604) | \* Update bugs email to a more professional looking address, and remove the |

| [607](#L607) | BarnOwl r989 (2008-03-21) |
| [608](#L608) | \* Stick modules on the beginning of @INC, not the end - nelhage |
| [609](#L609) | \* Merge in the select branch. BarnOwl's main loop now uses a select() |
| [610](#L610) | based event loop rather than continually polling, and uses much less |
| [611](#L611) | CPU. - asedeno |
| [612](#L612) | \* Fix a bug where an explicit (local) realm foiled |
| [613](#L613) | owl\_message\_get\_cc\_without\_recipient(). (per quentin) - geofft |

| [707](#L707) | BarnOwl r751 (2007-08-01) |
| [708](#L708) | \* Refactored message processing: All new messages, incoming or outgoing, get |
| [709](#L709) | added to the owl\_global\_messagequeue by protocol code, and then passed to |

| [833](#L833) | Don't crash doing zlocate with bad tickets. [BZ 12] |
| [834](#L834) | Metion the path for the owlconf in intro.txt [BZ 54] |
| [835](#L835) | Print better error message if startup fails due to unreadable |
| [836](#L836) | .owlconf [BZ 57] |
| [837](#L837) | In load-subs: Print an error message if the file is unreadable or |
| [838](#L838) | doesn't exist, UNLESS load-subs is called with no arguments.  In |
| [839](#L839) | that case only print an error if the file exists but isn't |
| [840](#L840) | readable.  Still prints an error either way if zephyr reports a |
| [841](#L841) | failure. [BZ 19] |
| [842](#L842) | Fixed some small memory leaks in logging if files unwriteable |
| [843](#L843) | If the variable logfilter is set it names a filter.  Any messages |
| [844](#L844) | matching this filter are logged.  This is an independent |
| [845](#L845) | mechanism from the other logging variables.  If you want to |
| [846](#L846) | control all logging with logfilter the other variables must be |
| [847](#L847) | set to their default (off) settings. [BZ 37] |
| [848](#L848) | Relatively substantial changes made under the hood to support |
| [849](#L849) | filter logging.  Now have more consistent interfaces to |
| [850](#L850) | creating messages etc.  Still needs more work though. |
| [851](#L851) | Deal gracefully with being resized as small as 1x1 [BZ 3] |
| [852](#L852) |  |
| [853](#L853) | 2.1.10 |
| [854](#L854) | Fix a new problem finding libdes425 |
| [855](#L855) | Don't crash on very long hostnames [BZ 52] |
| [856](#L856) | In 'sub' command, create .zephyr.subs if it doesn't exist [BZ 15] |
| [857](#L857) | A fix for certain resize crashes (partly from alexmv) [BZ 55] |
| [858](#L858) | Turn off ISTRIP (gildea) |
| [859](#L859) |  |
| [860](#L860) | 2.1.9 |
| [861](#L861) | Include /usr/include/kerberosIV if it's found |
| [862](#L862) |  |
| [863](#L863) | 2.1.8 |
| [864](#L864) | Do OLC formatting for anything coming from olc.matisse |
| [865](#L865) | Improvements to popup size algorithm (from gildea) |
| [866](#L866) | Improved 'show colors' with non-colored labels |
| [867](#L867) |  |
| [868](#L868) | 2.1.7 |
| [869](#L869) | The colorclass command is added, to make colorization easy |
| [870](#L870) | Handle MIT Athena OLC zephyrs correctly |
| [871](#L871) | Updated ktools website / bug address |
| [872](#L872) | Do ntohs() when printing zephyr port in zephyr info |
| [873](#L873) | Updated man page |
| [874](#L874) |  |
| [875](#L875) | 2.1.6 |
| [876](#L876) | Fixed three bugs found by Valgrind. |
| [877](#L877) | Fixed a case where doing "aim addbuddy" instead of "addbuddy aim" |
| [878](#L878) | would cause a segfault. |
| [879](#L879) | pexec will now incrimentally display data as it is output |
| [880](#L880) | by the child process.  Additionally, commands running under |
| [881](#L881) | pexec may now be killed by quitting out of the popless window. |
| [882](#L882) | Added muxevents select loop dispatcher.  File descriptors may |
| [883](#L883) | be registered with muxevents and handlers will be dispatched |
| [884](#L884) | to when data is available for non-blocking read/write/except. |
| [885](#L885) | Switched the stderr\_redir stuff to use muxevents. |
| [886](#L886) | Print C-\ correctly (from gildea) |
| [887](#L887) | Dropped first brace in muxevents functions for consistency |
| [888](#L888) | Catch SIGHUP and SIGTERM and do a proper logout |
| [889](#L889) |  |
| [890](#L890) | 2.1.5 |
| [891](#L891) | Added a licence |
| [892](#L892) | The 'personalbell' variable can now be set to 'on' 'off' or |
| [893](#L893) | the name of a filter to match against |
| [894](#L894) | The 'loglogins' variable now controls whether login/logout |
| [895](#L895) | messages are logged.  It is off by default.  For now this |
| [896](#L896) | affects only AIM messages, later zephyr login/logout messages |
| [897](#L897) | will also be logged if this is set to 'on' |
| [898](#L898) | Added 'show license' |
| [899](#L899) |  |
| [900](#L900) | 2.1.4 |
| [901](#L901) | Normalize and downcase AIM names for logging |
| [902](#L902) | Fixed a bug where sending a null zsig could cause a crash |
| [903](#L903) | Better 'away' toggling if only one protocol is away. |
| [904](#L904) |  |
| [905](#L905) | 2.1.3 |
| [906](#L906) | Added perl filter elements.  Similar to having "filter <subfilter>" |
| [907](#L907) | in a filter, you may also have "perl <functionname>" |
| [908](#L908) | where <functionname> is passed an owl::Message object and |
| [909](#L909) | returns 0 or 1 depending on whether the message matches |
| [910](#L910) | that element of the filter. |
| [911](#L911) | Don't print an error about loading subs if there is no |
| [912](#L912) | .zephyr.subs |
| [913](#L913) | Do the initial zephyr\_buddy\_check when pseduologin set to true. |
| [914](#L914) | Updated man page |
| [915](#L915) |  |
| [916](#L916) | 2.1.2 |
| [917](#L917) | removed unused filter\_depth variable |
| [918](#L918) | Fixed memory bug on receiving pings |
| [919](#L919) |  |
| [920](#L920) | 2.1.1 |
| [921](#L921) | Filters of filters now work. |
| [922](#L922) | Removed the "possibly not readable" part of the config parsing |
| [923](#L923) | error |
| [924](#L924) | In the sepbar, reverse video the view name when it's not set to |
| [925](#L925) | view\_home (as opposed to the static 'all'). |
| [926](#L926) | The '!' key (bound to 'view -r') now creates a negative version of |
| [927](#L927) | the current view and switches to it.  i.e. "show me all the |
| [928](#L928) | messages that are not these" |
| [929](#L929) | Added the 'ignorelogins' variable |
| [930](#L930) | Log when outgoing personal message fails |
| [931](#L931) | Removed file descriptor from sigpipe catcher printer just for now, |
| [932](#L932) | since the field does not exist on OSX |
| [933](#L933) | Added an ifndef for socklen\_t in libfaim/ft.c |
| [934](#L934) | Added the 'aim search' command.  The popup on callback may be |
| [935](#L935) | dangerous, should switch to an admin msg for results, or add a |
| [936](#L936) | new event queue |
| [937](#L937) | First pass at AIM away messages.  It is a little different from |
| [938](#L938) | what most clients seem to do, in that an away reply is sent for |
| [939](#L939) | each message received.  Most clients only reply to the first one |
| [940](#L940) | per away-session. |
| [941](#L941) | Now have a set of 'aaway' commands and variables just like the |
| [942](#L942) | 'zaway' ones (except that changing the 'aaway' variable talks to |
| [943](#L943) | the server) |
| [944](#L944) | The new 'away' command does everything for both AIM \*and\* zephyr. |
| [945](#L945) | There is a known funkiness here, where if you turn one away on, |
| [946](#L946) | and then use 'away' (or 'A') to toggle, you will turn on off and |
| [947](#L947) | the other on.  Just leaving it for now.  Should do better in the |
| [948](#L948) | next patch. |
| [949](#L949) | The 'A' key is bound to 'away' |
| [950](#L950) | Status bar can now read AWAY, Z-AWAY or A-AWAY. |
| [951](#L951) | Changed C-n to scroll down just a line in popless |
| [952](#L952) | If the config exists but is not readable, print an error before |
| [953](#L953) | exiting |
| [954](#L954) | Only print forced AIM logout message once. |
| [955](#L955) | Don't bind F1 to help in edit context |
| [956](#L956) | Fix bug in 'getsubs' with no tickets |
| [957](#L957) | New code for getting users from .anyfile |
| [958](#L958) | Added the 'pseudologins' variable, and code to do it |
| [959](#L959) | new attributes 'pseudo' 'logintty' and 'loginhost' |
| [960](#L960) | Don't print extra new lines in popless\_file |
| [961](#L961) | New zephyr\_get\_field function |
| [962](#L962) |  |
| [963](#L963) | 2.0.14 |
| [964](#L964) | Fixed missing word in startup message |
| [965](#L965) | Better 'status' command |
| [966](#L966) | Use '+' for popwin corners when 'fancylines' is off |
| [967](#L967) | Allow TERMINFO to be overridden in the envrionment |
| [968](#L968) | Command line arg -D turns on debugging and deletes previous |
| [969](#L969) | debugging file |
| [970](#L970) | Do ~ expansion in 'dump' command. |
| [971](#L971) | Current directory added to 'status' command |
| [972](#L972) | Massive changes to libfaim and aim |
| [973](#L973) |  |
| [974](#L974) | 2.0.13 |
| [975](#L975) | Changed startup message for new mailing list |
| [976](#L976) | blist now prints AIM info even if .anyone is unreadable |
| [977](#L977) | Catch SIGPIPE and print an error rather than crashing. |
| [978](#L978) | [It's possible that this may have some portability |
| [979](#L979) | issues under Solaris and we may need to add some |
| [980](#L980) | configure stuff around SA\_SIGINFO...] |
| [981](#L981) | Handle the case in aim\_bstream\_send where aim\_send returns -1, |
| [982](#L982) | although there is likely an underlying problem here |
| [983](#L983) | that would lead to this case. |
| [984](#L984) | Print the username on aim login failure, not something random like |
| [985](#L985) | the password.  ;) |
| [986](#L986) | Un-word-wrap text when sending AIM messages. |
| [987](#L987) | Replace the main loop continue in the keyboard handler with an else. |
| [988](#L988) |  |
| [989](#L989) | 2.0.12 |
| [990](#L990) | Command history now doesn't allow the last entry |
| [991](#L991) | to be repeated |
| [992](#L992) | If format\_msg returns "" print "<unformatted message>" |
| [993](#L993) | Better align oneline admin and loopback messages |
| [994](#L994) | Print an admin message indicating when subscriptions can |
| [995](#L995) | not be loaded on startup |
| [996](#L996) | Set aim\_ignorelogin\_timer to 15 by default |
| [997](#L997) | Admin message on login/logout of AIM |
| [998](#L998) | Fixed double quoting in smartzpunt |
| [999](#L999) | Added timestamp to login/logout messages |
| [1000](#L1000) | Fixed replies to loopback messages |
| [1001](#L1001) | Fixed smartnarrow on classes/instances with spaces |
| [1002](#L1002) | Added the 'loggingdirection' variable |
| [1003](#L1003) | All loopback messages log to 'loopback' now |
| [1004](#L1004) | Print an error message if trying an invalid color for a filter |
| [1005](#L1005) | Fixed bug causing > not to go to end of editwin every time |
| [1006](#L1006) |  |
| [1007](#L1007) | 2.0.11 |
| [1008](#L1008) | Updated basic help |
| [1009](#L1009) | Display CC: in outgoing CC messages |
| [1010](#L1010) | More AIM logout detection |
| [1011](#L1011) | Don't proclaim "interfaces changed" on first build. |
| [1012](#L1012) | Added the 'loopback' message type |
| [1013](#L1013) | Added the 'loopwrite' command |
| [1014](#L1014) | Added a timestamp to the default style |
| [1015](#L1015) | Zpunt now works with weird regex characters |
| [1016](#L1016) | Smart filters now work with weird regex characters |
| [1017](#L1017) |  |
| [1018](#L1018) | 2.0.10 |
| [1019](#L1019) | Allow 'hostname' in filters. |
| [1020](#L1020) | Fixed bug in reporting when no one is subbed to a class |
| [1021](#L1021) | Added an extral newline in logging incoming zephyrs |
| [1022](#L1022) | An admin message is displayed when you are logged out of AIM |
| [1023](#L1023) | Print an error message and admin message if an AIM send fails |
| [1024](#L1024) |  |
| [1025](#L1025) | 2.0.9 |
| [1026](#L1026) | Added the 'fancylines' variable. |
| [1027](#L1027) | Added the 'show startup' command. |
| [1028](#L1028) | Added feature for capturing stderr messages |
| [1029](#L1029) | from commands and displaying them in the errors buffer. |
| [1030](#L1030) | Create an admin message explaning that a zephyr couldn't |
| [1031](#L1031) | be sent |
| [1032](#L1032) | Better reporting of perl errors (both into the errqueue |
| [1033](#L1033) | and also clearing the error after displaying it). |
| [1034](#L1034) | Allow default\_style to be specified in config. |

| [1041](#L1041) | Fixed bug with idle times causing broken pipes. |
| [1042](#L1042) | New libfaim |

| [1044](#L1044) | Make sure that a newline is always at the end of messages |
| [1045](#L1045) | returned by perl style formatting functions. |
| [1046](#L1046) | Add owl::login and owl::auth to legacy variables populated for format\_msg. |
| [1047](#L1047) | Additions to intro.txt and advanced.txt documents.  (Still in progress.) |
| [1048](#L1048) | Add base methods for login\_host and login\_tty |
| [1049](#L1049) | and others that return undef. |
| [1050](#L1050) | New API for perl message formatting functions. |
| [1051](#L1051) | Legacy variables are still supported for owl::format\_msg |
| [1052](#L1052) | and owl::receive\_msg, but these functions are now also |
| [1053](#L1053) | passed an owl::Message object which contains methods |
| [1054](#L1054) | for accessing the contents of the message.  See perlwrap.pm |
| [1055](#L1055) | (and docs TBD) for the available methods. |
| [1056](#L1056) | \*\*\* WARNING:  The exact API for owl::Message has |
| [1057](#L1057) | \*\*\* not yet stabilized. |
| [1058](#L1058) | Added "style" command for creating new styles. |
| [1059](#L1059) | Usage:  style <name> perl <function\_name> |
| [1060](#L1060) | Added support for "show styles".  Changed global style table |
| [1061](#L1061) | from list to dictionary. |
| [1062](#L1062) | Changed AIM password prompt from "Password:" to "AIM Password:". |
| [1063](#L1063) | Messages are reformatted after a window resize to allow styles |
| [1064](#L1064) | to take into account the width of the window. |
| [1065](#L1065) | When perl throws an error, the message is put in the msgwin |
| [1066](#L1066) | if possible. |
| [1067](#L1067) | Added perl functions for: |
| [1068](#L1068) | owl::getcurmsg() -- returns an owl::Message object for |
| [1069](#L1069) | the active message |
| [1070](#L1070) | in the current view. |
| [1071](#L1071) | owl::getnumcols() -- returns the column width of the window |
| [1072](#L1072) | owl::zephyr\_getrealm() -- returns the zephyr realm |

| [1201](#L1201) | will be executed when new messages arive that match the |
| [1202](#L1202) | alert\_filter |
| [1203](#L1203) | added the 'term' command which takes the 'raise' and 'deiconify' |

| [1217](#L1217) | keypress.c: ifdefs for keys not defined on at least some solarises. |
| [1218](#L1218) | owl.c: don't call use\_default\_colors if we don't have it |
| [1219](#L1219) | readconfig.c: added \*commented out\* code to try to find a |
| [1220](#L1220) | system-default owlconf if the user doesn't have one.  Have to |
| [1221](#L1221) | ponder if I want this |
| [1222](#L1222) | zcrypt.c: don't prototype des\_ecb\_encrypt if there is a prototype in |

| [1330](#L1330) | lock up. |
| [1331](#L1331) | Messages now have a direciton (in, out or none).  Filters can |
| [1332](#L1332) | match on this direction |
| [1333](#L1333) | Outbound messages are no longer type 'admin' but are of the |
| [1334](#L1334) | appropriate message type (i.e. 'zephyr') and are direction |
| [1335](#L1335) | 'out'. |

| [1345](#L1345) | 1.2.2 |
| [1346](#L1346) | Added the 'search' command. |
| [1347](#L1347) | '/' is a keybinding for 'search' |
| [1348](#L1348) | '?' is a keybinding for 'search -r' |

| [1350](#L1350) | renamed owl\_fmtext\_ztext\_stylestrip to owl\_function\_ztext\_styletsrip |
| [1351](#L1351) | and put it in functions.c |
| [1352](#L1352) | Attempts to stay near the current message when switching views. |
| [1353](#L1353) | When switching from an empty view to one we've previously |
| [1354](#L1354) | been in, the new current message position will attempt |
| [1355](#L1355) | to be close to the current position from the last |
| [1356](#L1356) | time we visited that view. |
| [1357](#L1357) | Fixed bug in readconfig.c that prevented building under perl 5.005. |

| [1359](#L1359) | 'getsubs' prints closer to the order you sub in. |
| [1360](#L1360) | Modified the behavior of last so that "> >" will clear the screen. |
| [1361](#L1361) | The new behavior of last is: |
| [1362](#L1362) | Moves the pointer to the last message in the view. |
| [1363](#L1363) | If we are already at the last message in the view, |
| [1364](#L1364) | blanks the screen and moves just past the end of the view |
| [1365](#L1365) | so that new messages will appear starting at the top |
| [1366](#L1366) | of the screen. |
| [1367](#L1367) | Fixed a typo in the help for smartzpunt. |
| [1368](#L1368) | Fixed functions to handle curmsg being past the end of the view. |
| [1369](#L1369) |  |
| [1370](#L1370) | 1.2.1 |
| [1371](#L1371) | New framework for command handling. |
| [1372](#L1372) | New framework for keymap handling. |
| [1373](#L1373) | Added commands for everything that is bound |
| [1374](#L1374) | to a key (do 'show commands' to get the full list). |
| [1375](#L1375) | Added 'multi' and '(' commands to allow multiple commands |
| [1376](#L1376) | to be specified on a line. |
| [1377](#L1377) | Added user keybindings with bindkey command. |
| [1378](#L1378) | Added command aliases (eg, "alias foo bar"). |
| [1379](#L1379) | Added undelete command that parallels the delete command. |
| [1380](#L1380) | Added additional options to delete command. |
| [1381](#L1381) | The reply command now takes arguments. |
| [1382](#L1382) | Added 'edit:insert-text' command. |
| [1383](#L1383) | Added 'show zpunts' to show active punt filters. |
| [1384](#L1384) | Added 'show variable <name>' and 'show variables'. |
| [1385](#L1385) | Added 'show command <name>' and 'show commands'. |
| [1386](#L1386) | Added 'show keymap <name>' and 'show keymaps'. |
| [1387](#L1387) | Added 'M-u' to undelete all messages in current view. |
| [1388](#L1388) | Fixed dotsend so that the zephyr will still send if there |
| [1389](#L1389) | is whitespace after the dot but not on the same line. |
| [1390](#L1390) | This should resolve an issue where dotsend wouldn't work |
| [1391](#L1391) | if you'd gone up and edited a zephyr. |
| [1392](#L1392) | Bug in page down fixed |
| [1393](#L1393) | C-t will transpose characters |
| [1394](#L1394) | Fix the scrolling bug where we would sometimes fail to scroll |
| [1395](#L1395) | the screen down, leaving the current message off |
| [1396](#L1396) | the bottom of the screen. |
| [1397](#L1397) | Refixed 'login or login' typo in help |
| [1398](#L1398) | Fixed M-u description |
| [1399](#L1399) | Removed 'first' and 'last' from basic command help |
| [1400](#L1400) | Added M-N to basic key help |
| [1401](#L1401) | Added M-D, M-u to basic key help |
| [1402](#L1402) | Fixed a quoting problem in configure.in |
| [1403](#L1403) | Changed top of help to use 'show' instead of M-x |
| [1404](#L1404) | Fixed a bug in the summary field for user-created aliases |
| [1405](#L1405) | Added "reply zaway" which sends a zaway response to the current msg. |
| [1406](#L1406) | Added "edit:delete-prev-word" command and bound M-BACKSPACE to it. |
| [1407](#L1407) | Some buffer overruns fixed |
| [1408](#L1408) | Variables now have a summary and a long description. |
| [1409](#L1409) | Only the summary is shown with help. |
| [1410](#L1410) | The long description is shown with "show variable foo". |
| [1411](#L1411) | Added a 'scrollmode' variable which determines how the screen |
| [1412](#L1412) | will scroll as the cursor moves.  The default behaves |
| [1413](#L1413) | identically to previous versions of owl. |
| [1414](#L1414) | The following modes are supported: |
| [1415](#L1415) | normal      - This is the owl default.  Scrolling happens |
| [1416](#L1416) | when it needs to, and an attempt is made to |
| [1417](#L1417) | keep the current message roughly near |
| [1418](#L1418) | the middle of the screen.  (default) |
| [1419](#L1419) | top         - The current message will always be the |
| [1420](#L1420) | the top message displayed. |
| [1421](#L1421) | neartop     - The current message will be one down |
| [1422](#L1422) | from the top message displayed, |
| [1423](#L1423) | where possible. |
| [1424](#L1424) | center      - An attempt is made to keep the current |
| [1425](#L1425) | message near the center of the screen. |
| [1426](#L1426) | paged       - The top message displayed only changes |
| [1427](#L1427) | when user moves the cursor to the top |
| [1428](#L1428) | or bottom of the screen.  When it moves, |
| [1429](#L1429) | the screen will be paged up or down and |
| [1430](#L1430) | the cursor will be near the top or |
| [1431](#L1431) | the bottom. |
| [1432](#L1432) | pagedcenter - The top message displayed only changes |
| [1433](#L1433) | when user moves the cursor to the top |
| [1434](#L1434) | or bottom of the screen.  When it moves, |
| [1435](#L1435) | the screen will be paged up or down and |
| [1436](#L1436) | the cursor will be near the center. |
| [1437](#L1437) | Added owl\_sprintf which returns the formatted string, or NULL. |
| [1438](#L1438) | The caller must free this string. |
| [1439](#L1439) | This will allocate enough memory and thus |
| [1440](#L1440) | avoid potential some buffer overrun situations. |
| [1441](#L1441) | Simple implementation of 'zwrite -m' (doesn't yet log an outgoing |
| [1442](#L1442) | message as having been sent.) |
| [1443](#L1443) | The "Not logged in or subscribing to messages" error |
| [1444](#L1444) | now includes the name of the recipient. |
| [1445](#L1445) | The "disable-ctrl-d" variable may also be set to "middle" |
| [1446](#L1446) | which will result in ctrl-d only sending at the |
| [1447](#L1447) | end of the message.  This is now the default. |
| [1448](#L1448) | This also added a command "editmulti:done-or-delete". |
| [1449](#L1449) | Fixed a bug in the "reply -e" command. |
| [1450](#L1450) | Always clear the command buffer before executing the command. |
| [1451](#L1451) | (So that interactive commands can sanely do start-command.) |
| [1452](#L1452) | Fixed preservation of e->dotsend across owl\_editwin\_clear(). |
| [1453](#L1453) | Added history for multiline edit windows (eg, for zephyr composition). |
| [1454](#L1454) | The M-n and M-p keys will cycle through the history ring. |
| [1455](#L1455) | In particular, it is now possible to edit the command line |
| [1456](#L1456) | of a zephyr being composed:  C-c it and restart it |
| [1457](#L1457) | and then M-p to get the aborted composition back. |
| [1458](#L1458) | Added owl::send\_zwrite(command, message) to the perl glue |
| [1459](#L1459) | to allow for the direct sending of multi-line messages. |
| [1460](#L1460) | For example:  owl::send\_zwrite("-c foo -i bar", "hello"); |
| [1461](#L1461) | Changed owl\_fmtext\_print\_plain to return an alloc'd string to |
| [1462](#L1462) | avoid buffer overrun risks. |
| [1463](#L1463) | Added owl::ztext\_stylestrip("...") function to perlglue |
| [1464](#L1464) | which returns the ztext with formatting stripped out. |
| [1465](#L1465) | Added colorztext variable which can be used to disable @color() |
| [1466](#L1466) | strings arriving in messages after it is set. |
| [1467](#L1467) | (Currently, changing its value won't reformat messages). |
| [1468](#L1468) | Outgoing zephyr logging now obeys the logpath variable. |
| [1469](#L1469) | The '~' character in logpath and classlogpath now gets |
| [1470](#L1470) | replaced with the user's home directory. |
| [1471](#L1471) | Added simple implementation of smartnarrow-to-admin that |
| [1472](#L1472) | creates a "type-admin" autofilter. |
| [1473](#L1473) | This was done mostly so that M-C-n and M-C-p do something |
| [1474](#L1474) | sane on admin messages. |
| [1475](#L1475) | Added opera to the allowed options to the webbrowser variable. |
| [1476](#L1476) | Fixed some buffer overruns in the "reply" command. |
| [1477](#L1477) | When repying to "all" on a message that begins with "CC:" (eg, sent |
| [1478](#L1478) | with "zwrite -C", the reply line will be constructed |
| [1479](#L1479) | from the sender and the usernames on the CC: line |
| [1480](#L1480) | of the message being replied to. |
| [1481](#L1481) | There is no such thing as C-R, so left C-r as it is but added: |
| [1482](#L1482) | M-r --- edit reply to all |
| [1483](#L1483) | M-R --- edit reply to sender |
| [1484](#L1484) | Added RCS Id strings to all files. |
| [1485](#L1485) | 'show keymaps' shows details of all keymaps after summary list. |
| [1486](#L1486) | Added --no-move option to delete command. |
| [1487](#L1487) | In particular, delete-and-always-move-down may now |
| [1488](#L1488) | be implemented with |
| [1489](#L1489) | '( delete --no-move ; next --skip-deleted )'. |
| [1490](#L1490) | Folded the nextmsg and prevmsg commands and functions together into |
| [1491](#L1491) | one command which takes arguments. |
| [1492](#L1492) | Added '--filter <name>' option (eg, for next\_personal), |
| [1493](#L1493) | '--skip-deleted' option, and |
| [1494](#L1494) | '--last-if-none'/'--first-if-none' options. |
| [1495](#L1495) | Help updated accordingly. |
| [1496](#L1496) | In particular, the 'personal' filter is now used |
| [1497](#L1497) | for 'next personal'. |
| [1498](#L1498) | Added --smart-filter and --smart-filter-instance options |
| [1499](#L1499) | to the next and prev commands. |
| [1500](#L1500) | Updated examples/owlconf.erik with the above. |
| [1501](#L1501) | Made owl\_function\_fast\*filt return a string and not do the |
| [1502](#L1502) | narrowing, to make it more general. |
| [1503](#L1503) | Added a smartfilter command that creates a filter |
| [1504](#L1504) | based on the current message and returns the name |
| [1505](#L1505) | of the filter. |
| [1506](#L1506) | Added M-C-n and M-C-p keybindings to "move to next message |
| [1507](#L1507) | matching current" and "move to previous message |
| [1508](#L1508) | matching current" |
| [1509](#L1509) | Added variables edit:maxfillcols and edit:maxwrapcols which |
| [1510](#L1510) | will limit how wide editing paragraphs may get before |
| [1511](#L1511) | they get wrapped.  This is a max and may be narrower |
| [1512](#L1512) | depending on the current size of the window. |
| [1513](#L1513) | If 0, the max is unlimited.  Default is 70 columns for |
| [1514](#L1514) | edit:maxfillcols and unlimited for edit:maxwrapcols. |
| [1515](#L1515) | Added smartzpunt command with key binding of "C-x k". |
| [1516](#L1516) | This starts a zpunt command filled in with |
| [1517](#L1517) | the proposed zpunt. |
| [1518](#L1518) | Fixed a memory reference bug in delete and undelete commands. |
| [1519](#L1519) | Added support for perl to call directly back into owl. |
| [1520](#L1520) | Changed the implementation of owl::command("...") to immediately |
| [1521](#L1521) | call back into owl.  This allows perl to get the return |
| [1522](#L1522) | value of strings returned by owl commands. |
| [1523](#L1523) | Added the getview command which returns the name of the current |
| [1524](#L1524) | view's filter. |
| [1525](#L1525) | Added the getvar command which returns the value of a variable. |
| [1526](#L1526) | Added an example to examples/owlconf.erik which uses TAB to |
| [1527](#L1527) | narrow and restore the view. |
| [1528](#L1528) | Added an example to examples/owlconf.erik which uses M-c to |
| [1529](#L1529) | color messages matching the current one green. |
| [1530](#L1530) | Integrated change to fix problem with popup blinking on new zephyrs. |
| [1531](#L1531) | C-l and resizes will now refresh an open viewwin (eg, help). |
| [1532](#L1532) | Updated doc/code.txt to include info about filters, commands, |
| [1533](#L1533) | contexts, and keybindings. |
| [1534](#L1534) | Exec commands cleaned up to not have buffer-size limitations |
| [1535](#L1535) | and to not mess up spaces.  exec also returns a string |
| [1536](#L1536) | of the output now. |
| [1537](#L1537) | Integrated changes from 1.1.3, and added docs for "zlocate -d" |
| [1538](#L1538) | and new show commands. |
| [1539](#L1539) | Show with arguments produces help on show. |
| [1540](#L1540) | Fix a bug in readconfig caught by efence (where we'd try to read before |
| [1541](#L1541) | the beginning of a string if it was empty). |
| [1542](#L1542) | The perl command doesn't do makemsg directly, but instead |
| [1543](#L1543) | returns the string and it will get printed if it |
| [1544](#L1544) | was run interactively. |
| [1545](#L1545) |  |
| [1546](#L1546) | 1.1.3 |
| [1547](#L1547) | 'show subs' and 'show subscriptions' are now the same as 'getsubs' |
| [1548](#L1548) | zlocate now takes an optional -d argument |
| [1549](#L1549) | 'show terminal' / 'show term' |
| [1550](#L1550) | '>' / last doesn't set the last message at the top of the screen now |
| [1551](#L1551) | implemented \_followlast as an unsupported feature |
| [1552](#L1552) | include 'default' in the 'show colors' list |
| [1553](#L1553) | added help for 'zpunt' and 'zunpunt' |
| [1554](#L1554) | changed the bug address in the startup message |
| [1555](#L1555) | can now do 'show status' |
| [1556](#L1556) | can now do 'show version' |
| [1557](#L1557) | 'status' / 'show status' includes the owl version number now |
| [1558](#L1558) | 'show terminal' includes whether the terminal can change colors |
| [1559](#L1559) | fixed off by one bugs in paging / scrolling viewwin |

| [1561](#L1561) | support @owl::fields as well as @fields |
| [1562](#L1562) | downcase class/inst filter names in auto filters |
| [1563](#L1563) |  |
| [1564](#L1564) | 1.1.2 |
| [1565](#L1565) | Fixed memory mishandling bug |
| [1566](#L1566) | Fixed bug in redfining the filter attached to the current view |
| [1567](#L1567) | M-n will narrow to message, instance on non-personal, class |
| [1568](#L1568) | MESSAGE messages |
| [1569](#L1569) | M-N behavies like M-n except that on class messages it narrows |
| [1570](#L1570) | to class and instance |
| [1571](#L1571) | line wrap earlier, to account for tabbing |
| [1572](#L1572) | fixed typo in help |
| [1573](#L1573) | 'status' command now displays info on terminal color support |
| [1574](#L1574) | zephyr @ formatting is now case independant |
| [1575](#L1575) | added support for color terminals |
| [1576](#L1576) | zephyr @color(foo) now works |
| [1577](#L1577) | 'D' for deleted messages is now not bold, unless it's the current |

| [1584](#L1584) | incoming messages |
| [1585](#L1585) | If colors are available 'show filters' will show a filter in the |
| [1586](#L1586) | color associated with it. |
| [1587](#L1587) | Added the zpunt and zunpunt commands |
| [1588](#L1588) | Lines in the subs file starting with '-' are zpunted |

| [1591](#L1591) |  |
| [1592](#L1592) | 1.1.1 |
| [1593](#L1593) | Fixed perl, aperl, and pperl commands to deal with quoting |
| [1594](#L1594) | and spaces in a saner manner. |
| [1595](#L1595) | Removed all owl\_get\_\* methods for booleans and switched |
| [1596](#L1596) | cases where they were used to owl\_is\_\* |
| [1597](#L1597) | Changes to owlconf.erik to use some new features. |
| [1598](#L1598) | Increased the size of the help buffer (as it |
| [1599](#L1599) | was overflowing and truncating the help message). |
| [1600](#L1600) | Variables prefixed with a \_ are not shown in help |
| [1601](#L1601) | or by printallvars (and prefixed Not Yet Implemented |
| [1602](#L1602) | variables with this). |

| [1665](#L1665) | after the strdup to "out", we'd strcat a \n onto the end. |
| [1666](#L1666) | This would be triggered whenever owl::format\_msg returned |
| [1667](#L1667) | a string not ending in a newline |
| [1668](#L1668) | Added 'X' keybinding which expunges and then switches to |
| [1669](#L1669) | a view defined by the variable "view\_home" which defaults |
| [1670](#L1670) | to "all" |
| [1671](#L1671) | Consolidated readconfig.c somewhat to remove duplication. |

| [1674](#L1674) | (examples/owlconf.vtformat) |
| [1675](#L1675) | Added the 'perl', 'aperl', and 'pperl' commands which will |
| [1676](#L1676) | evaluate perl expressions. |
| [1677](#L1677) | Fixed bug where pclose zsigproc would cause zombies |
| [1678](#L1678) | Can set zsigproc or zsig to "" to disable |
| [1679](#L1679) | Added support for multiple browsers (galeon and none were added). |
| [1680](#L1680) | Configure with the "webbrowser" variable. |
| [1681](#L1681) | Changing typewinsize height triggers resize event. |
| [1682](#L1682) | Added zsig variable which will be used if no zsigproc and non-empty. |
| [1683](#L1683) | Added "make test" rule to Makefile which will run regression tests, |
| [1684](#L1684) | and added regression testing framework to tester |
| [1685](#L1685) | Fixed codelist.pl to ignore static declarations. |
| [1686](#L1686) | Added dict.c which contains string->ptr dictionary routines |
| [1687](#L1687) | and the owl\_dict type. |
| [1688](#L1688) | These include regression tests. |
| [1689](#L1689) | Overhaul/rewrite of variable handling.  Variables are now managed |
| [1690](#L1690) | in an owl\_vardict (in g.vars) which contains a dictionary |
| [1691](#L1691) | of owl\_variable's.  Each owl\_variable has dispatch functions |
| [1692](#L1692) | for validating values, setting it and getting it, |
| [1693](#L1693) | and for setting it to and from string values. |
| [1694](#L1694) | The variable.c file contains the list of variables. |
| [1695](#L1695) | Stubs for the owl\_global\_<varname>\_get functions and friends |
| [1696](#L1696) | are generated from variable.c by stubgen.pl. |
| [1697](#L1697) | The help.c messages for variables now calls into variable.c |
| [1698](#L1698) | so all information about most variables is in one place. |
| [1699](#L1699) | Cleaned out code from global.c and command.c that was made obselete |
| [1700](#L1700) | by variable overhaul. |
| [1701](#L1701) | The set command now takes a -q option to not log a message. |
| [1702](#L1702) | Fixed a bug where set and print with no arguments would |
| [1703](#L1703) | print "Undefined variable" in addition |
| [1704](#L1704) | to running owl\_function\_printallvars. |
| [1705](#L1705) | debug is now a variable that can be turned on and off. |
| [1706](#L1706) | Fixed mail,inbox message parsing in examples/owlconf.erik |
| [1707](#L1707) | Made zaway\_msg and zaway\_msg\_default into variables |
| [1708](#L1708) | Changed owl\_function\_makemsg and owl\_function\_debugmsg |
| [1709](#L1709) | to use varargs (ie, so they can now take a format |
| [1710](#L1710) | string with args). |
| [1711](#L1711) | Don't allow " and \ characters in URLs with the "w" command. |
| [1712](#L1712) | Removed lots of build warnings. |
| [1713](#L1713) | Popwins are wider by default so help messages fit better. |
| [1714](#L1714) | Added an atokenize\_free function. |
| [1715](#L1715) | Fixes to work with an older version of libzephyr. |
| [1716](#L1716) | Added dependencies on header files to Makefile.in |
| [1717](#L1717) | Added pageup and pagedown key bindings to message list |
| [1718](#L1718) | Added pageup and pagedown to viewwin |
| [1719](#L1719) | Added configfile section to doc/intro.txt (from example config file) |
| [1720](#L1720) | Added appendtosepbar variable which may contain text which will |
| [1721](#L1721) | be appended to the sepbar.  This allows the configfile |
| [1722](#L1722) | to put information about pings and logins into |
| [1723](#L1723) | the sepbar.  (It may be worth also providing a variable |
| [1724](#L1724) | which enables this by default, but for now this allows |
| [1725](#L1725) | for experimenting with what works well.) |
| [1726](#L1726) | Added doc/code.txt which gives a brief overview of the code. |
| [1727](#L1727) | Added tags makefile rule and added TAGS to distclean rule. |

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: owl

owl and BarnOwl are affected by multiple buffer overflows that are remotely exploitable. These vulnerabilities are fixed in BarnOwl 1.0.5:

<http://barnowl.mit.edu/wiki/barnowl-1.0.5-announce>

(BarnOwl is a fork of the unmaintained owl project that fixes many important bugs and adds new features. It is usable as a drop-in replacement for owl.)

There is currently no fix in Debian that can be synced. Debian is considering several possible resolutions, including potentially removing owl in favor of BarnOwl. I will update this bug when a decision is reached in Debian.

This was fixed in Debian in owl 2.2.2-1, and synced into Karmic. I’m not sure about the best way to handle this for Jaunty and before.

owl (2.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

\* New upstream release. The upstream author has become active again and

    has worked with the barnowl developers on security issues. (Closes: #515118)

  \* configure.in, debian.control: barnowl updates via Sam Hartman

    eliminate retro libkrb4 and des425 dependencies. (Closes: #517019)

      \* Do not link against libkrb4 or libkrb5; we use none of their symbols

      \* Support openssl DES for zcrypt so that we continue to have zcrypt

        after libdes425 goes away

      Note: ditched the KerberosIV test entirely to force this version,

      allowing build/test on lenny.

  \* zcrypt.c: use des.h again, so we get the openssl one above.

  \* from unreleased 2.1.11-3:

      \* debian/control: version debhelper depends (lintian

        package-lacks-versioned-build-depends-on-debhelper.)

      \* debian/watch: New file.

  \* debian/control: add libglib2.0-dev, per configure.in

```
package: owl
Version: 2.1.11-2
severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: cve-2009-0363

zwrite.c and zcrypt.c contain multiple buffer overflows in calls to sprintf
	that appear to be remotely exploitable.
Please see the patch to barnowl 1.0.1-4 for a minimal set of changes that we
	think addresses this vulnerability.
However there have been other related changes to barnowl and owl may well have
	more vulnerabilities in this area.

I'll take a look at those patches and also see if upstream is at all
interested.  (Last resort would be a self-immolating
use-barnowl-instead package.)

so we should be able to kick out a new package within the week.

# [Security update for Debian Testing - 2009-02-14](/search?l=debian-testing-security-announce@lists.debian.org&q=subject:%22Security+update+for+Debian+Testing+%5C-+2009%5C-02%5C-14%22&o=newest)

[secure-testing-team](/search?l=debian-testing-security-announce@lists.debian.org&q=from:%22secure%5C-testing%5C-team%22)
[Fri, 13 Feb 2009 17:05:09 -0800](/search?l=debian-testing-security-announce@lists.debian.org&q=date:20090213)

```
This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently
fixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing
from unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the
testing-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable
packages are removed from Debian testing.
```
```

DTSA:
=====
The following issues have been fixed by uploads to testing-security:

barnowl 1.0.1-4:
DTSA-197-1    : barnowl
CVE-2009-0363: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0363>

Migrated from unstable or testing-proposed-updates:

               <http://bugs.debian.org/513456>

How to update:
--------------
Make sure the line

        deb <http://security.debian.org> lenny/updates main contrib non-free

is present in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Of course, you also need the line
pointing to your normal lenny mirror. You can use

        aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade

to install the updates.

More information:
-----------------
More information about which security issues affect Debian can be found in the
security tracker:
