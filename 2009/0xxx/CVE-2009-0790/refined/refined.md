Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located within the pluto IKE daemon of both strongswan and openswan.
- A specially crafted Dead Peer Detection (DPD) packet can trigger a crash within the pluto IKE daemon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) flaw caused by improper handling of a malicious DPD packet in the pluto IKE daemon.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the pluto IKE daemon, causing a denial of service. This will interrupt IPSec connectivity for the affected system, as the daemon manages the IPSec tunnels.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- An attacker sends a specially crafted DPD packet to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send IP packets to the target system.
- The attacker would typically need to know the IP address of the target system.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided content, it appears the attacker does not require authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of OpenSUSE, SLES, Debian, and likely other Linux distributions that use affected versions of openswan or strongswan.
- Patches were released for both openswan and strongswan to resolve this issue.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves improved handling of DPD packets within the pluto IKE daemon.

The provided information from various sources consistently points towards this vulnerability being a denial of service issue related to the processing of DPD packets in the IKE daemon. The fix involves updated packages that properly handle these packets and prevents the daemon from crashing.
