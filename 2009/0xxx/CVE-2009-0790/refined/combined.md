1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- openswan/strongswan
By sending a specially crafted Dead Peer Detection (DPD) packet
remote attackers could crash the pluto IKE daemon (CVE-2009-0790).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- clamav
ClamAV was updated to version 0.95 to also fix some potential security
bugs. (CVE-2009-1241)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-base
Specially crafted cover art tags in vorbis files could trigger a
heap overflow in the base64 decoder. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0586).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, SLE11
- gnome-panel
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services break
due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- postgresql
Remote authenticated users could crash the postgresql server by requesting
a conversion with an inappropriate encoding (CVE-2009-0922). This was a
minor version upgrade.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- acroread\_ja
Multiple flaws in the JBIG2 decoder and the JavaScript engine of the
Adobe Reader allowed attackers to crash acroread or even execute
arbitrary code by tricking users into opening specially crafted PDF
files. (CVE-2009-0658, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2009-0193, CVE-2009-0928,
CVE-2009-1061, CVE-2009-1062)
Affected products: SLED10-11
- ghostscript
With this update the ghostscript-library four vulnerabilities were fixed:
- heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder (CVE-2009-0196)
- integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792)
- crash in CCITTFax decoder
- buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module
Affected products: SLE11 (packages for other products will be
released soon)
- xine-devel/libxine-devel
Specially crafted 4x movie files could cause an integer overflow in
xine-lib (CVE-2009-0698).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10-11
- moodle
Special command sequences in TeX files allowed users to read arbitrary
files (CVE-2009-1171).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gnutls
The previous security fix for gnutls (CVE-2008-4989) introduced a re-
gression in the X.509 validation code for self-signed certificates.
This update fixes this problem.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10 (will be released soon),
SLE11
- udev update on SLES 10 requires udevd restart
The previously released udev update requires a restart of the udev
daemon on SLES 10. Either use
/etc/init.d/boot.udev restart
or reboot the machine.
On other SUSE products udevd is restarted by just applying the update
already.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1759-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Steffen Joeris
March 30, 2009                   	<http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : strongswan
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-0790

Gerd v. Egidy discovered that the Pluto IKE daemon in strongswan, an
IPSec implementation for linux, is prone to a denial of service attack
via a malicious packet.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4-5+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0+dfsg-1+etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Debian (oldstable)
- ------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Package        : openswan
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2008-4190 CVE-2009-0790
Debian Bug     : 496374

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in openswan, an IPSec
implementation for linux. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-4190

Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the livetest tool is using temporary
files insecurely, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

CVE-2009-0790

Gerd v. Egidy discovered that the Pluto IKE daemon in openswan is prone
to a denial of service attack via a malicious packet.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.12+dfsg-1.3+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.6+dfsg.2-1.1+etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your openswan packages.

Upgrade instructions
