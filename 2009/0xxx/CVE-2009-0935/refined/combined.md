Subject: CVE request: kernel: inotify local DoS

According to the upstream commit 3632dee2, if userspace supplies an
invalid pointer to a read() of an inotify instance, the inotify device's
event list mutex is unlocked twice. This causes an unbalance which
effectively leaves the data structure unprotected, and we can trigger
oopses by accessing the inotify instance from different tasks
concurrently.

In the 2.6.27.y stable releases, this affects 2.6.27.13 and earlier.
In the 2.6.28.y stable releases, this affects 2.6.28.2 and earlier.

2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

------------------

From: Vegard Nossum <vegard.nossum@gmail.com>

commit 3632dee2f8b8a9720329f29eeaa4ec4669a3aff8 upstream.

If userspace supplies an invalid pointer to a read() of an inotify
instance, the inotify device's event list mutex is unlocked twice.
This causes an unbalance which effectively leaves the data structure
unprotected, and we can trigger oopses by accessing the inotify
instance from different tasks concurrently.

The best fix (contributed largely by Linus) is a total rewrite
of the function in question:

Thanks, Eugene!  More interpretation for those looking at various
kernel versions for those changes:

16dbc6c96163 was introduced between 2.6.27-rc8 and 2.6.27-rc9, so
2.6.26 and earlier are not affected.   The change represented by
16dbc6c96163 was also not imported into the 2.6.26.y stable release
tree during its lifetime, so no 2.6.26.y releases are affected either.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=488935#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-06 09:29:11 UTC  ``` Description of problem: If userspace supplies an invalid pointer to a read() of an inotify instance, the inotify device's event list mutex is unlocked twice. This causes an unbalance which effectively leaves the data structure unprotected, and we can trigger oopses by accessing the inotify instance from different tasks concurrently.  <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4857/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=488935#c1)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-06 09:58:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334277](attachment.cgi?id=334277&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334277&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=3632dee2f8b8a9720329f29eeaa4ec4669a3aff8>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=488935#c17)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-03-19 04:18:18 UTC  ``` CVSS2 score of medium, 4.7 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)   ``` |  |
