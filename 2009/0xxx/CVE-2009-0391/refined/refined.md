Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0391:

**Verification:**

The IBM support document for APAR PK79232 mentions "PK72036 Application Server is prone to an arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability.".  This corresponds to CVE-2009-0391, although the CVE description is missing here.

**Analysis:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is an arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability in the IBM WebSphere Application Server.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability is present. This could stem from inadequate validation of user-supplied input when requesting files from the server.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive files from the server by exploiting this vulnerability. The exact impact depends on the nature and location of the files that can be accessed. This could expose configuration files, source code, user data, and other sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting requests to the WebSphere Application Server that manipulate file paths. The vulnerability would likely be accessible through HTTP requests, allowing the attacker to specify arbitrary file paths to be accessed by the application server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server. This means that the attacker must have network access to the server. The attacker does not need prior credentials to exploit this particular vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

The IBM document provides a list of other fixes included in APAR PK79232, but the content focuses mostly on the general fixes of WebSphere Application Server V6.0.1 for z/OS. The document also indicates the fix is available in service level (fix pack) 6.0.2.33.

The Secunia Research document is a general overview of their vulnerability research services and does not contain information on the specific vulnerability.
