{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The webframe 0.76 application has multiple file inclusion vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) via the `classFiles` parameter in `/mod/admin/doc/index.php`, `/mod/index.php`, and `/mod/base/menu.php`",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) via the `currentmod` and `LANG` parameters in `/mod/index.php`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially executing malicious code (RFI), or include local files, potentially disclosing sensitive information or application code (LFI).",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts.",
      "Manipulation of the `classFiles`, `currentmod`, and `LANG` URL parameters"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. For RFI, the attacker needs a server to host the malicious payload. For LFI, the attacker needs to know the path of the local files."
