Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Local Directory Traversal issue in the `xstandard editor` component of Joomla! versions 1.5.8 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `X_CMS_LIBRARY_PATH` HTTP header in the `attachmentlibrary.php` file. This header allows a user to specify an arbitrary path, leading to the ability to traverse directories outside the intended scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the path provided in the `X_CMS_LIBRARY_PATH` header. This enables attackers to access files and directories outside of the intended web root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive data such as configuration files, database credentials, or source code.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** By gaining access to sensitive files, attackers may be able to gain deeper access to the system, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `attachmentlibrary.php` with a specially constructed `X_CMS_LIBRARY_PATH` header.
*   The path provided in the header contains directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate to unintended directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The provided exploit code does not indicate the need for prior authentication. This suggests the vulnerability can be exploited without requiring valid credentials to the vulnerable Joomla application.
