  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-0552",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been initialized or has been deleted.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized memory access",
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete control of the system if the user has administrative privileges. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted web page",
        "Compromised websites",
        "Websites hosting user-provided content or advertisements",
          "Phishing attacks via email or instant messaging"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted web page that can be viewed by a victim using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. This may be achieved by hosting the crafted page on a website or using other methods to deliver web content (e.g. through banner advertisements). The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the page through various means, such as phishing links in email or instant messages.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 5.01 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1. Internet Explorer 7 and 8 are not vulnerable to this specific issue. The update modifies the way Internet Explorer handles memory objects to address the vulnerability. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. "
