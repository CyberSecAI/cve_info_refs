{
  "CVE-2009-0021": {
    "Description": "The ntpd daemon incorrectly checks the return value of the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function. On systems using NTPv4 authentication, this may allow a maliciously crafted signature to bypass the cryptographic signature validation, which may lead to a time spoofing attack.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "ntpd incorrectly checks the return value of the openssl function EVP_VerifyFinal.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect return value check of cryptographic function.",
      "Improper handling of cryptographic signature validation."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Time spoofing attack, potentially leading to incorrect timestamps or other time-sensitive issues.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack",
         "Malicious NTP server"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to intercept or manipulate network traffic between client and NTP server.",
      "Possession of a crafted malformed signature that can pass the faulty validation."
       , "Ability to act as a malicious NTP server."
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "Affects NTP versions <= 4.2.4p5 (production) and <= 4.2.5p150 (development).",
      "Also affects other software using the EVP_VerifyFinal, such as eID-belgium.",
      "Exploitation possible when NTP authentication is enabled."
    ]
