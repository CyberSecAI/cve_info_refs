### Overview

The Autonomy Ultraseek search engine contains a URL redirection vulnerability that may allow an attacker to redirect website users to other sites.

### Description

| The Autonomy Ultraseek search engine contains a URL redirection vulnerability in the /cs.html?url= paramater. The destination URL can be obsfucated in the redirect by using URL encoding techniques. To exploit this issue, an attacker would need to get a user to click on a link or browse to a website. |

### Impact

| --- |

### Solution

| Ultraseek administrators should contact Ultraseek [support](http://customers.autonomy.com/) for information on how to obtain updated software that addresses this issue. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds** Using firewalls, reverse proxy servers, or web application firewalls to block URLs that contain the string /cs.html?url= may prevent some attackers from exploiting this vulnerablity. This workaournd can be evaded by URL obsfucation/encoding and will not be completely effective if the web server uses SSL. |
