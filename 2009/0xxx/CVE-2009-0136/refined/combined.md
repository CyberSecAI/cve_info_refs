How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:18:26 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached tcl-8.3.3.ebuild and tk-8.3.3.ebuild.  These ebuilds accomplish the following:  1. split the tcl and tk packages into separate ebuilds. This makes writing ebuilds for packages that depend on tcl and/or tk much easier to handle (see expect-5.33.0.ebuild post and the vim-6.0-r2.ebuild patch attached).  I recommend putting the tcl ebuild under dev-lang/tcl and the tk ebuild under dev-tcltk/tk.   2. ebuilds are now version independent.   Renaming ebuilds to *-8.4.2.ebuild should work.  I have not tested this, but these ebuilds were based on the tcl-tk-8.4.2.ebuild.  3. The original tcl-tk-8.3.3.ebuild did not install the private headers and config.sh's for tcl and tk.  This is why vim-6.0-r2.ebuild did not work with 'use tcltk'  4. Promotes world peace and smells minty fresh.  Splitting up tcl and tk into separate ebuilds may cause some minor pain updating the dependencies of ebuilds that depend on them, but I think it is worth it in the long run.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:19:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 13](attachment.cgi?id=13 "tk-8.3.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=13&action=edit "tk-8.3.3.ebuild")] tk-8.3.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:18:30 UTC  ``` Accepting as a real bug.  I'm testing the ebuilds out on my system. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:37:14 UTC  ``` It works for me, so I'm committing the ebuild. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-09 14:44:14 UTC  ``` Hi!  Some additional info that might be of use.  1. The expect ebuild ([bug 28](show_bug.cgi?id=28 "RESOLVED FIXED - expect-5.33.0.ebuild")) is a good test of a working tcl and tk installation. It depends on tcl-8.3* and tk-8.3*, but won't compile because the private headers are not installed by the current tcl-tk ebuild.  2. Contrary to my original comments, the submitted tcl-8.3.3 ebuild does not fix the vim --with-tcl problem.  It does allow vim to be compiled successfully using the --with-tcl configure flag and the resulting vim appears to run fine, however it doesn't pass the  VIMINIT='let OS = system("uname -s")' vim test that agriffis pointed out to me (see vim-6.0-r3.ebuild)  This appears to be an upstream vim issue.  tod ``` |  |

| Package | **media-sound/amarok** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.10-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.10-r2** |

### Background

Amarok is an advanced music player.

### Description

Tobias Klein has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Amarok:

* Multiple integer overflows in the Audible::Tag::readTag()
  function in metadata/audible/audibletag.cpp trigger heap-based buffer
  overflows (CVE-2009-0135).
* Multiple array index errors in the
  Audible::Tag::readTag() function in metadata/audible/audibletag.cpp can
  lead to invalid pointer dereferences, or the writing of a 0x00 byte to
  an arbitrary memory location after an allocation failure
  (CVE-2009-0136).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
Audible Audio (.aa) file with a large "nlen" or "vlen" tag value to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Amarok users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/amarok-1.4.10-r2"
```

Package        : amarok
Vulnerability  : integer overflows
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : not assigned yet

Tobias Klein discovered that integer overflows in the code the Amarok
media player uses to parse Audible files may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-4etch1. Updated packages for sparc and arm will be
provided later.

For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.10-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your amarok packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Advisory ID: TKADV2009-002
Revision: 1.1
Release Date: 2009/01/11
Last Modified: 2009/02/15
Date Reported: 2009/01/05
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: Amarok < version 2.0.1.1
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://amarok.kde.org/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-IDs: CVE-2009-0135, CVE-2009-0136
Patch development time: 7 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
Amarok contains several integer overflows and unchecked allocation
vulnerabilities while parsing malformed Audible digital audio files.
The vulnerabilities may be exploited by a (remote) attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of Amarok.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file from Amarok 2.0:
amarok-2.0\src\metadata\audible\audibletag.cpp

Description of integer overflow #1 that leads to a heap buffer overflow:
[1] A user defined value is extracted from the media file and stored in
the unsigned int variable "nlen".
[2] In this line a heap buffer of "nlen+1" bytes is allocated. By supplying
a value of 0xffffffff for "nlen" an integer overflow happens resulting
in the allocation of a very small heap buffer.
[3] The user controlled value of "nlen" is used as a length specifier to
copy user controlled data from the media file into the previously
allocated (small) heap buffer pointed to by "name". As "nlen" has a
very large value (0xffffffff) the heap buffer is overflowed with user
controlled data of the media file. The exact number of bytes that get
written beyond the heap buffer can be controlled by the length of the
media file. This leads to a controllable heap overflow vulnerability.
Description of the unchecked allocation vulnerability #1 that may result in
an exploitable memory corruption condition:
[2] + [4] This code fails to check for a NULL pointer returned from a new
[] statement. The resulting pointer is then dereferenced by the
user controlled value of "nlen" and a 8-bit value of 0x00 is
assigned to the dereferenced location. This issue can be
exploited to overwrite an arbitrary memory location with the 1-
byte value 0x00. A malicious party may exploit this issue to
execute arbitrary code by overwriting a sensitive memory location
(such as a buffer length or boolean variable).
Description of integer overflow #2 that leads to a heap buffer overflow:
[5] A user defined value is extracted from the media file and stored in
the unsigned int variable "vlen".
[6] In this line a heap buffer of "vlen+1" bytes is allocated. By supplying
a value of 0xffffffff for "vlen" an integer overflow happens resulting
in the allocation of a very small heap buffer.
[7] The user controlled value of "vlen" is used as a length specifier to
copy user controlled data from the media file into the previously
allocated (small) heap buffer pointed to by "value". As "vlen" has a
very large value (0xffffffff) the heap buffer is overflowed with user
controlled data of the media file. The exact number of bytes that get
written beyond the heap buffer can be controlled by the length of the
media file. This leads to a controllable heap overflow vulnerability.
Description of the unchecked allocation vulnerability #2 that may result in
an exploitable memory corruption condition:
[6] + [8] This code fails to check for a NULL pointer returned from a new
[] statement. The resulting pointer is then dereferenced by the
user controlled value of "vlen" and a 8-bit value of 0x00 is
assigned to the dereferenced location. This issue can be
exploited to overwrite an arbitrary memory location with the 1-
byte value 0x00. A malicious party may exploit this issue to
execute arbitrary code by overwriting a sensitive memory location
(such as a buffer length or boolean variable).
In Amarok versions < 2.0 the source code of the vulnerable function is
slightly different but suffers from the same vulnerabilities.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- boinc-client
The boinc-client was missing return value checks for openssl function
calls. (CVE-2009-0126)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xrdp
This update fixes multiple buffer overflows that can be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-5902, CVE-2008-5903,
CVE-2008-5904)
Additionally xrdp does not register remote session as local anymore.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- phpMyAdmin
A version upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.4 to fix various security
bugs. (CVE-2008-2960, CVE-2008-3197, CVE-2008-1149, CVE-2008-1567,
CVE-2008-1924, CVE-2008-4096, CVE-2008-4326, CVE-2008-5621, CVE-2008-5622)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- libnasl
This update of libnasl adds missing return value checks for openssl
function calls. (CVE-2009-0125)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- moodle
Insufficient quoting of wiki page titles allowed attackers to
conduct cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2008-5432)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- net-snmp
Remote attackers could crash net-snmp via GETBULK-Request
(CVE-2008-4309).
In addition the following non-security issues have been fixed:
- typo in error message
- make OIDs longer than 256 chars work
- typo in the snmpd init script to really load all agents
- logrotate config to restart the snmptrapd as well
Affected products: SLES9, NLD9, SLES10, SLED 10
- audiofile
A heap-overflow in libaudiofile was fixed. The overflow existsed
in the WAV processing code and can be exploited to execute arbi-
trary code. (CVE-2008-5824)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- XFree86/xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command
execution was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an
xterm. (CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Support for Matrox G200EV/G200WB cards was added.
Affected products: OES, SLES9, NLD9
- amarok
This update of amarok fixes several integer overflows and unchecked
memory allocations that can be exploited by malformed Audible digital
audio files. These bugs could be used in a user-assisted attack sce-
nario to execute arbitrary code remotely. (CVE-2009-0135, CVE-2009-
0136)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLED10
- libpng
This update of libpng fixes the function png\_check\_keyword() that
allowed setting arbitrary bytes in the process memory to 0.
(CVE-2008-5907)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, OES, SLES9, NLD9, SLES 10,
SLED10
- sudo
This update of sudo fixes a bug that allowed - depending on the
sudoers rules - a sudo-user to execute arbitrary shell commands as
root. (CVE-2009-0034)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- avahi
Specially crafted mDNS packets could crash the Avahi daemon
(CVE-2008-5081).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED10

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Subject: CVE Request -- amarok

Hello Steve,

  multiple integer overflows (leading to heap-based overflows)
and unchecked allocation vulnerabilities has been reported
against Amarok multimedia player whep parsing malformed
Audible digital audio files. Upstream has fixed
these in latest 2.0.1.l release.

References:
<http://www.trapkit.de/advisories/TKADV2009-002.txt>
<http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.0.1.1>   (Fix possible buffer overflows when parsing Audible .aa files.)
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479946>
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=254896>

Proposed solution: Upgrade to latest upstream version 2.0.1.1

Affected Amarok version: amarok-1.4.10-1.fc9 <= x < latest upstream 2.0.1.1 release

Attaching also diff for audibletag.cpp file between latest F10 (amarok-2.0-2.fc10)
and latest upstream 2.0.1.1 release (see attachment).

Could you please allocate a new 2009 CVE id for it?

Thanks, Jan.
