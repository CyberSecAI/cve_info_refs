Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-0136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Multiple array index errors in the `Audible::Tag::readTag` function within `metadata/audible/audibletag.cpp`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Array Index Errors:** The code contains multiple instances where user-controlled data (`nlen` and `vlen`) are used as array indices, without proper bounds checking. This can lead to:
  - Invalid pointer dereferences
  - Writing a `0x00` byte to an arbitrary memory location after an allocation failure

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can cause an application crash due to invalid memory access.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting specific memory locations, including function pointers, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution. This may include overwriting a buffer length or boolean variable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted Audible Audio (.aa) Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specifically crafted Audible Audio files, where the `nlen` and `vlen` tag values are manipulated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted Audible Audio (.aa) file with a vulnerable version of Amarok.
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an Audible Audio (.aa) file with specific crafted tag values.

**Technical Details**

The vulnerability occurs in the `Audible::Tag::readTag` function within `audibletag.cpp`. The code reads tag lengths (`nlen` and `vlen`) from a file, allocates memory, and reads data using these lengths. There are two vulnerabilities relating to allocation failures and dereferences:
1.  After reading `nlen` and allocating `*name = new char[nlen+1]`, the code does not check if allocation fails, it immediately writes `(*name)[nlen] = '\0'` . This can cause a crash if `new` fails and returns a null pointer.
2.  The same lack of null pointer check also happens for `vlen` with `*value = new char[vlen+1]` and then `(*value)[vlen] = '\0'`

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Amarok versions 1.4.10 through 2.0.1.
- Patches have been applied to correct this issue.
- The issues stem from integer overflows in conjunction with memory allocation issues. Specifically, if `nlen` or `vlen` are set to `0xffffffff`, the allocation will wrap around to a small number of bytes, and the subsequent reads will cause heap buffer overflows.
- The fix involves checking for allocation failures and setting a maximum tag size.
