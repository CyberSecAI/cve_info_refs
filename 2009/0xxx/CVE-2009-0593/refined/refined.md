Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0593

**Vulnerable Software:** plxAutoReminder v3.7

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization within the `members.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input in SQL queries without sanitizing or validating the input, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other potentially confidential information. As demonstrated by the provided exploit, an attacker can use `union select` statements to inject SQL code and obtain information such as the database user, version, and database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `members.php` script, appending a SQL injection payload to the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication (in the specific case of demo):** Although usually the user needs to be logged in, the provided exploit also includes a user/password combo for a demo site.
*  **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft SQL injection payloads.
