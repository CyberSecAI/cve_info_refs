- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect return code checking after calling `EVP_VerifyFinal`, `DSA_verify`, and `DSA_do_verify` functions in OpenSSL and other packages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of digital signature verification results, leading to malformed signatures being accepted as valid.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious server or man-in-the-middle attacker can present a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to a vulnerable client, bypassing validation. This could allow the attacker to impersonate a legitimate server or bypass other security checks that rely on signature validation.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attacks and malicious servers presenting malformed certificates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or control the communication between a vulnerable client and a server, or control a malicious server. The attacker also needs to be able to create a malformed signature to send to the vulnerable client.
