Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0805:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the piCal module for PEAK XOOPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages. This is specifically a reflected XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential execution of arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is network-based and involves injecting malicious script into input fields or parameters within the piCal module, and enticing the user to load the malicious content. The attack requires the user to load content that contains the script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious input containing JavaScript or other scripting languages and inject them in the vulnerable web application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to load a link or webpage containing the malicious script.
