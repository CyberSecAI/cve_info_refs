The provided content relates to CVE-2009-0763.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure coding practices in the Kipper 2.01 application, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote Data Reading:** Exposure of sensitive configuration data via a direct URL access.
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Vulnerability in `index.php` allowing arbitrary file inclusion from the server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Vulnerability in `default.php` due to improper handling of user input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Data Reading:** Attackers can access sensitive configuration data.
- **Local File Inclusion:** Attackers can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts, leading to potential session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Data Reading:** Direct access via a crafted URL.
- **Local File Inclusion:** By manipulating the `configfile` parameter in the `index.php` URL.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** By crafting a malicious payload in the `charm` parameter of the `default.php` URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable Kipper 2.01 application.
- The attacker can be remote, accessing the vulnerable application via HTTP requests.
