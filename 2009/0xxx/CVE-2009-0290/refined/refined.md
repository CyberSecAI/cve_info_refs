Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `common.php` file of GNUBoard v4.31.03 (08.12.29). The script uses `@extract($_GET)`, `@extract($_POST)`, and `@extract($_SERVER)` to import request parameters into variables.  Crucially, it then uses a user-controlled `$g4_path` variable in `include_once()` statements without proper sanitization, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI). While there is a check to prevent `://` within the `$g4_path` variable, this can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files through the `$g4_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to read sensitive files on the server.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The check for `://` in the `$g4_path` is insufficient and can be bypassed in several ways (e.g. with null byte injection or data URIs).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a specially crafted file (either local or remote with the correct configuration), an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the web server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could read local files, including configuration files and other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the `g4_path` parameter in the URL.
*   **Null Byte Injection:**  The provided example demonstrates how a null byte (`%00`) can be appended to the path to truncate it and bypass checks.
*   **Data URI Scheme:** The attacker can use a `data://` URI to include arbitrary PHP code if `allow_url_include` is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand HTTP requests and parameters.
*   **PHP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand PHP to create the payload and exploit the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db content mentions that if the PHP configuration `allow_url_include` is enabled, the vulnerability can become a Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This means that a malicious attacker can include arbitrary code from a remote server.
*   The provided exploit includes a PHP code example that can be used to test for the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is specifically located in `common.php`.
*   The affected version of GNUBoard is 4.31.03 (08.12.29).
