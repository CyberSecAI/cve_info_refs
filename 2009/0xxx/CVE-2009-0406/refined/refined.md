Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0406

**Vulnerable Software:** Community CMS version 0.4 and below

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a blind SQL injection flaw within the Community CMS application. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly output the results of the SQL query. Instead, the attacker must infer whether the injection was successful based on the application's response. In this case, the exploit script checks for the "Failed to load page" message, which indicates a failed query, meaning the injection was not successful.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user passwords. The provided exploit code specifically targets the password column in the `comcms_users` table.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database user's privileges and other system configurations, a successful SQL injection could lead to further compromise. This could include gaining access to other parts of the system, or manipulating data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` page, where the vulnerable `id` parameter is injected with SQL code.
- **Blind Injection Exploitation:** The exploit uses a boolean based blind SQL injection technique. It attempts to extract the user password character by character by sending a series of queries. Each query attempts to match one character in the password using the `ASCII` and `SUBSTRING` SQL functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of HTTP and SQL:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP requests and SQL queries.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `id` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable.
- **Ability to send crafted requests:** The attacker requires to send HTTP GET requests with the injected SQL payload.

**Additional Details from Exploit:**
- The provided exploit script automates the process of extracting the password.
- It iterates through the characters in the password, using a predefined set of characters (`abcdef0123456789`).
- It uses `fsockopen` to send HTTP requests and `preg_match` to check the responses.
- The exploit targets the password for a specified username.

**In summary,** the content describes a blind SQL injection vulnerability in Community CMS 0.4, allowing an attacker to extract sensitive information like user passwords by crafting HTTP GET requests.
