  "cveId": "CVE-2009-0652",
  "description": "Mozilla Firefox 3.0.6 does not properly prevent the literal rendering of homoglyph characters in IDN domain names, which allows remote attackers to spoof URLs and conduct phishing attacks, as demonstrated by homoglyphs of the / (slash) and ? (question mark) characters in a subdomain of a .cn domain name, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-0233.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the browser's failure to properly handle and prevent the literal rendering of homoglyph characters within Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs). These homoglyphs visually resemble other characters, particularly the slash (/) and question mark (?) characters in this instance, which can lead to misrepresentation of the actual domain name.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of homoglyphs",
      "Lack of proper IDN validation",
      "Failure to prevent visual spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables attackers to conduct phishing attacks by creating URLs that appear legitimate to users but redirect them to malicious websites. Attackers can use this technique to steal credentials, sensitive information, or infect systems.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Malicious web pages with specially crafted IDNs",
      "Phishing emails with deceptive URLs"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": [
      "Ability to create web pages or emails with custom URLs",
      "Knowledge of homoglyphs and their visual similarity to common characters"
    ],
     "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability was demonstrated with homoglyphs of slash (/) and question mark (?) in a subdomain of a .cn domain name."
