| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=479336#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

The IDN code contains a blacklist of characters that are confusingly similar to others that automatically kick us into the punycode display. This is stored as the pref "network.IDN.blacklist\_chars".
Apparently we're missing the box-drawing characters, and a recent talk at blackhat DC appears to have taken advantage of that to spoof an SSL connection to a bank.
<https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-09/Marlinspike/BlackHat-DC-09-Marlinspike-Defeating-SSL.pdf>
Since it's just a screen shot I can't be sure, but I can reproduce the results with those characters.Flags: wanted1.9.0.x+Flags: wanted1.8.1.x+Flags: blocking1.9.1?Flags: blocking1.9.0.8?Flags: blocking1.8.1.next?

Specifically I meant
2571 BOX DRAWING LIGHT DIAGONAL UPPER RIGHT TO LOWER LEFT
There are other potential omissions from the list, characters that look similar to other characters we've already included. Should maybe consider
066A ARABIC PERCENT SIGN
(and maybe 0609 and 060A depending on font)
2052 COMMERCIAL MINUS SIGN
both are percent signs with tiny dots, which on my system/font made a pretty good slash in the URL field.
2041 CARET INSERTION POINT (looks like a slash with a smudge on the bottom)
If we've included 05C3 HEBREW PUNCTUATION SOF PASUQ because it looks like a colon, shouldn't we also have
02D0 MODIFIER LETTER TRIANGULAR COLON
0589 ARMENIAN FULL STOP
2236 RATIO
A789 MODIFIER LETTER COLON
We've got 0702 SYRIAC SUBLINEAR FULL STOP. We might want to look into
0701 SYRIAC SUPRALINEAR FULL STOP (I doubt this one)
0703 SYRIAC SUPRALINEAR COLON
0704 SYRIAC SUBLINEAR COLON
We're inconsistent about fractions. We block on xBC and xBD but not xBE, and in the range 2153-215F which are all fractions we reject seven and allow six.
One that doesn't work in my font but shows up in the Unicode charts as a slash-like char is
1735 PHILIPPINE SINGLE PUNCTUATION
In any case, we need to add 2571.

Yep, chuck them all in. If we find a letter that has this problem, we may have to stop and ask more questions, but if it's punctuation, I have no problem adding it.

Many of those punctuation characters probably would have been coalesced under NAMEPREP had they existed in earlier Unicode versions. Looks like the IETF is in the process of standardizing "IDNA2008" to replace the earlier IDNA2003 (rfc 3490,3491,3492) we're following.
I filed [bug 479520](/show_bug.cgi?id=479520 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement IDNA2008 and Unicode UTS #46") on looking into that for a future version, for now we should just blacklist these characters.
I didn't find any characters scarier than what Moxie Marlinspike revealed at BlackHat, unhiding this bug to reduce duplicate filings.Group: core-security

## Synopsis

Critical: seamonkey security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0437)

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
(CVE-2009-1303, CVE-2009-1305)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was processed. A
web page containing malicious content could execute arbitrary JavaScript in
the context of the site, possibly presenting misleading data to a user, or
stealing sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-0652,
CVE-2009-1306, CVE-2009-1307, CVE-2009-1309, CVE-2009-1312)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey saved certain web pages to a local
file. If a user saved the inner frame of a web page containing POST data,
the POST data could be revealed to the inner frame, possibly surrendering
sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-1311)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-17 15:34:22 UTC  ``` Mozilla community member Michael reported that when a server responds with a Refresh header containing a javascript: URI, Firefox will redirect to the javascript: URI. If an attacker could inject a Refresh header into a server response, or could control the value that a site places in the Refresh header, they could use this vulnerability to perform an XSS attack and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of that site.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-21 23:59:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  Via RHSA-2009:0437 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0437.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-22 01:43:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0436.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 20:25:32 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.9-1.fc9, firefox-3.0.9-1.fc9, epiphany-extensions-2.22.1-10.fc9, epiphany-2.22.2-10.fc9, blam-1.8.5-8.fc9.1, chmsee-1.0.1-11.fc9, devhelp-0.19.1-11.fc9, evolution-rss-0.1.0-10.fc9, galeon-2.0.7-9.fc9, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc9, gnome-web-photo-0.3-20.fc9, google-gadgets-0.10.5-5.fc9, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-28.fc9, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc9.1, Miro-2.0.3-3.fc9, mozvoikko-0.9.5-9.fc9, mugshot-1.2.2-8.fc9, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-8.fc9, totem-2.23.2-14.fc9, yelp-2.22.1-11.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.

arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

<a href="<http://www.bank.com&#x2571;.example.com/>">...</a>
<a href="<http://www.bank.com&#xFF1A;8888&#x2571;.example.com/>">...</a>
Firefox allows users to click the link and displays essentially the following strings in the status and address bar (if it was able to make the request):
<http://www.bank.com/.example.com/>
<http://www.bank.com:8888/.example.com/>
On Windows and MacOSX the requests both go to \*.example.com, and in case of the latter the request will be malformed as it includes
Host: [www.bank.xn--com:8888-br3e.example.com]
While Apache rejects such a request, it's not difficult to work around that. I was unable to reproduce the problem on Linux. There are other characters that look like "/" and ":" though only some of them are displayed literally. Opera9 and IE7 consider both resource identifiers malformed and do not attempt to traverse them.

Sounds like we need to add these two to our blacklist
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/modules/libpref/src/init/all.js&rev=FIREFOX_1_5_0_7_RELEASE#621>
I'm a bit confused about the fullwidth colon though (xff1a). RFC 3490 section 3.1.1 says we must treat both fullwidth and halfwidth ideographic full stops as label separators, yet both \uFF0E and \uFF61 are in our blacklist. nsIDNService::normalizeFullStops() converts them before the blacklist is applied so I'm not sure why they're needed in the blacklist.
The IDNA spec doesn't mention accepting fullwidth colon as a port delimiter, but it would be somewhat consistent to do so.
\u2571 is a no-brainer to add. \u2573 sorta looks like an 'X', there are various "plus"-looking things.

Does the colon get converted in nameprep? I would have expected colon to be banned by net\_isValidHostName since I think we only call that after we've parsed and removed the port part, but we allow colon.
It looks like the whole box-drawing section isn't supposed to be allowed as output (<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/#IDN_Security_Profiles>). As long as we do allow them, though, \u2571 would be good to have in the blacklist as an interim band-aide.Assignee: nobody → usenet

Port delimiters are not part of the domain name, they could only be part of the resource identifier; since the URL is parsed for the domain name first, any colon or colon-lookalike character cannot delimit the domain name from the port. I initially included this character precisely to test that Mozilla does not handle it this way.

That's interesting: as the poster says, this doesn't appear to work on Linux; something peculiar is happening here, since this should work in exactly the same way on all operating systems.
I've got some code lying in an earlier IDN bug which never got merged, which might be useful for stopping this.

I think the best way to handle this in the short term is to add an extra check to isOnlySafeChars() that blacklists all characters that do not belong either to a script system, or to a very limited set of non-script characters. This will also have the effect of enforcing part of the ICANN rules for labels.
I've got some code lying around that might just do the trick.

Since ':' cannot occur in a domain name, it is likely that the DNS client code on Linux simply rejects any hostname containing it; on Windows this is not the case (compare, for example, `ping a:b.example.org` on both systems, where example.org needs to have a wildcard record). The first example should work on all systems.

I think it's time to for me push forward the code I wrote to address for [bug 316727](/show_bug.cgi?id=316727 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - IDN processing code should be ready to enforce script-mixing constraints"), which should fix this, as well as many other issues.
I've got a patch already made, but it's untested: I'm currently generating sets of test cases for it, to try on 2.0rc1+patch. More soon.

OK, test case 1 is now caught by my experimental patch, which also blocks a huge number of other characters by adopting a whitelisting-by-Unicode-blocks approach, in addition to the existing very specific blacklist.
However, the behavious in test case 2 is more involved: I think there's a possibility of an interaction between the Unicode normalization of the fullwidth colon and the IPv6 code...
I'll try to take a look at the on-the-wire behaviour across multiple operating systems tomorrow.

This patch defangs both of the examples given in this bug on my Linux build, without specifically needing to reference any particular character.
The first becomes
<http://www.bank.xn--com-544a.example.com/>
and the second becomes
<http://www.bank.xn--com:8888-br3e.example.com/>
ASCII domain names and normal mixed-script IDNs still appear to work OK: my set of broken IDNs with bad character are consistently caught by this, too, and it doesn't crash with any of the tests.
NB this patch has not been fully smoketested yet.

The second testcase is an example of "ASCII-smuggling" through Unicode normalization in the IDN Nameprep processing (see [bug 316444](/show_bug.cgi?id=316444 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Mozilla IDN code should set UseSTD3ASCIIRules to prevent subtle IDN attacks")). However the comment at the end of 316444 seems to be contradicted by the second test case here: see the issues regarding URL roundtripping at end of this comment.
I'm working on some code in [bug 355181](/show_bug.cgi?id=355181 "RESOLVED FIXED - net_IsValidHostName() comment says one thing, code does another") that should shut off the possibility of using the ':' character in IDNs, by discriminating between the allowed character sets for RFC 1035 DNS names and dotted quads, and that for RFC 2732 IPv6 literals.
However, this example also raises an interesting round-tripping issue, which will probably become a new bug: the ASCII-smuggling behaviour of the second example allows an address with a colon in it to appear in the location bar, but does not get looked up, so is OK. However, reparsing the very same text that is displayed in the location bar will truncate the new hostname at the colon, and thus end up looking up a quite different domain name.
This is a problem of
1 relying on Punycoding for obfuscation, when it was not originally intended for that purpose
2 URL display and URL parsing sometimes not being round-trippable

Time is a little tight and this hasn't been tested on the trunk yet so I'm a little worried about it... moving nomination request to next release for now, can always request approval on trunk-landed patches if that happens in time.
Is this patch ready for reviews now?Flags: blocking1.8.1.2?Flags: blocking1.8.1.1?Flags: blocking1.8.0.9?Flags: blocking1.8.0.10?

This bug probably needs to be update to "critical" or "blocker"; given the recent very public reports of experimental exploitation of this spoofing technique, we are almost certain to see it in the wild very soon.
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/19/ssl_busting_demo/>
(see page 2 of the report for the use of homographs in the attack)
I'm impressed by the use of a wildcard something.cn certificate: that's clever.
Unfortunately, I haven't got the time or resources to test my patch properly at the moment, but I believe the patch is reasonably OK, if someone else wants to QA it.

I've also got an experimental patch filed for [bug 316727](/show_bug.cgi?id=316727 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - IDN processing code should be ready to enforce script-mixing constraints") that enforces even more paranoid checking, preventing not only the use of unassigned characters, but also the mixing of scripts except in certain explicity allowed combinations, as per ICANN guidance on IDNs -- in the long run, that patch is probably superior to this one, but in the short run, it's would need more QA, and would be riskier to apply.

We definitely need a lot more discussion before banning script mixing. Let's just make sure the current character blacklist is solid.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### WAF Virtual Patching Challenge: Securing WebGoat with ModSecurity

Identification of web application vulnerabilities is only half the battle with remediation efforts as the other. Let's face the facts, there are many real world business scenarios
where it is not possible to update web application code in either a timely manner or at all. This is where the tactical use-case of implementing a web application firewall to address identified issues proves its worth.

This talk will provide an overview of the recommended practices for utilizing a web application firewall for virtual patching. After discussing the framework to use, we will then
present a very interesting OWASP Summer of Code Project where the challenge was to attempt to mitigate as many of the OWASP WebGoat vulnerabilities as possible using the open source
[ModSecurity web application firewall](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Securing_WebGoat_using_ModSecurity_Project). During the talk, we will discuss both WebGoat and ModSecurity
and provide in-depth walk-throughs of some of the complex fixes. Examples will include addressing not only attacks but the underlying vulnerabilities, using data persistence for
multiple-step processes, content injection and even examples of the new LUA programming language API. The goal of this talk is to both highlight cutting edge mitigation options
using a web application firewall and to show how it can effectively be used by security consultants who traditionally could only offer source code fixes.

Ryan C. Barnett is the Director of Application Security Research at Breach Security. He is also a Faculty Member for the SANS Institute, Team
Lead for the Center for Internet Security Apache Benchmark Project and a Member of the Web Application Security Consortium where he leads the Distributed Open
Proxy Honeypot Project. Mr. Barnett has also authored a web security book for Addison/Wesley Publishing entitled "Preventing Web Attacks with Apache."

## Cesar Cerrudo

### SQL Server Anti-Forensics

This presentation is about how SQL Server can be attacked leaving as few evidence as possible, so in case someone suspects of a possible incident then the
techniques used in the attack will make forensics investigation harder because lack of tracks or confusing tracks. While this presentation is focused on
Anti-Forensics, forensics techniques for SQL Server will be learned from the Anti-Forensics ones and from the concepts and theory explained. At the end
it will be discussed of how to protect your servers against these attacks.

Cesar Cerrudo
is the lead researcher for Application Security Incâs Team SHATTER and is the founder and CEO of Argeniss (www.argeniss.com), a security consultancy firm based in Argentina. He is a security researcher and consultant specializing in application security. Regarded as a leading application security researcher, Cesar is credited with discovering and helping to eliminate dozens of vulnerabilities in leading applications including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle database server, IBM DB2, Microsoft BizTalk Server,
Microsoft Commerce Server, Microsoft Windows, Yahoo! Messenger, etc. Cesar has authored several white papers on database,
application security, attacks and exploitation techniques and he has been invited to present at a variety of companies and conferences including Microsoft, Black Hat, Bellua, CanSecWest,
EuSecWest, WebSec. HITB, Microsoft BlueHat, etc. Cesar collaborates with and is regulary quoted in print and online publications including eWeek, ComputerWorld, and other leading journals.

## Matthew Flick

### XSS Anonymous Browser

Current anonymous Internet browsing applications build dynamic routes using a
network of willing hosts and layers of encryption along the route. The cross
site scripting anonymous browser ("XAB") exploits vulnerable web
sites/applications and victim browsers to build a network of drones. The intent
of XAB is not to replace the current applications, such as Tor, but rather to
provide an alternative that does not require willing participants and further
stretches the functionality and intent of JavaScript and other browser
technology.

Matt Flick has, for more than 8 years, developed his career in the information security industry, with expertise in application security and other areas within information security management, services, and auditing. Matt has worked with both commercial and federal government clients to help plan, develop, and assess their information security programs. Matt is currently a Principal with FYRM Associates Inc., an information security professional services organization, and a member of OWASP DC, ISACA and ISSA.

## Trey Ford

### **Alternate** Get Rich or Die Trying - "Making Money on The Web, The Black Hat Way"

Forget Cross-Site Scripting. Forget SQL Injection. If you want to make some serious cash on the Web silently and surreptitiously,
you donât need them. You also donât need noisy scanners, sophisticated proxies, 0-days, or ninja level reverse engineering skillsâall
you need is a Web browser, a clue on what to look for, and a few black hat tricks. Generating affiliate advertising revenue from the
Website traffic of others, trade stock using corporation information passively gleaned, inhibit the online purchase of sought after
items creating artificial scarcity, and so much more. Activities not technically illegal, only violating terms of service. You may
have heard these referred to as business logic flaws, but the name really doesnât do them justice. It sounds so academic and benign
in that context when the truth is anything but. These are not the same olâ Web hacker attack techniques everyone is familiar with,
but the one staring you in the face and missed because gaming a system and making money this way couldnât be that simple. Complicate
this furtherâIDS cannot detect them and Web application firewalls canât block them. If fact, these types of attacks are so hard to
detect (if anyone is actually trying) we arenât even sure how widespread their use actually is. Time to pull back the cover and expose
whatâs possible.

Trey Ford is the director of solutions architecture at WhiteHat Security, providing vision to customers,
partners, and prospects on website security initiatives. Mr. Ford also spearheads WhiteHatâs participation in the PCI Standards Council
and assists customers in navigating regulatory bodies. With a consulting background in risk assessment and regulatory compliance, Mr. Ford
is a frequent speaker at industry events, and is frequently quoted in media publications. Prior to WhiteHat, Trey served as compliance practice
lead at FishNet Security.

## Xinwen Fu

### One Cell is Enough to Break Tor's Anonymity

Tor is a real-world, circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication
network, supporting TCP applications over the Internet. In this talk, we will
present a new class of attacks, protocol-level attacks, against Tor. Different
from existing attacks, these attacks can confirm anonymous communication
relationships quickly and accurately by manipulating one single cell and pose a
serious threat against Tor. In protocol-level attacks, a malicious entry onion
router may duplicate, modify, insert, or delete cells of a TCP stream from a
sender. The manipulated cells traverse middle onion routers and arrive at an
exit onion router along a circuit. Because Tor uses the counter mode AES
(AES-CTR) for encrypting cells, the manipulated cells disrupt the normal counter
at exit onion routers and decryption at the exit onion router incurs cell
recognition errors, which are unique to the investigated protocol-level attacks.
If an accomplice of the attacker at the entry onion router also controls the
exit onion router and recognizes such cell recognition errors, the communication
relationship between the sender and receiver will be confirmed. Protocol-level
attacks can also be used for launching the denial-of-service (DoS) attack to
disrupt the operation of Tor. We systematically analyze the impact of these
attacks. We have implemented these attacks on Tor and our experiments validate
their effectiveness and efficiency. We also present guidelines for defending
against such attacks.

Xinwen Fu is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science,
University of Massachusetts Lowell. He has been teaching classes on software security, intrusion
detection, digital forensics and basic computer security stuff. The presentations from Black Hat
Briefings are his favorite class materials. He tried his best to demonstrate those tricks to
students. "Hack Proofing Your Network" was the textbook for his classes, software security and
intrusion detection. Dr. Fu's current research interests are in network security and privacy. He has
been building systems, and hacking kernels and systems through his research. He believes that hacking
plays a key role in making systems secure.

## Travis Goodspeed

### Reversing and Exploiting Wireless Sensors

Wireless sensors will soon be part of many industrial, military, and home networks. Of the various networking protocols—Zigbee,
ISA100, Wireless HART, 6LowPAN, and others--none has yet become a definitive standard. Neither have vendors standardized upon a given
operating system, compiler, or microcontroller. Users of these sensor networks are often given no command-line, no internal documentation,
and no access to the internals of each device.

This lecture provides a thorough introduction to reverse engineering such devices, both in hardware and in software. Along the way,
plenty of methods of exploiting and patching them will be covered.

Travis Goodspeed is a neighborly fellow from Knoxville in Southern Appalachia. He has spoken at ToorCon 9 and the Texas Instruments Developer's
Conference regarding stack overflow exploits of the MSP430-based wireless sensor networks. At Black Hat 2008, he demonstrated a timing attack
which allows confidential code to be extracted from recent revisions of the chip. Having demonstrated that such attacks are possible, his present
research is aimed at porting defense techniques to low-power embedded systems.

## Vincenzo Iozzo

### Let Your Mach-O Fly

Mac OS X is starting to spread among users, as such new exploitation
techniques have to be discovered. Even if a lot of interesting ways of exploitation on OSX were presented in
the past, the lack of anti-forensics techniques is clear.
The talk is focused on an in memory injection technique. Specifically how
it is possible to inject into a victim's machine any kind of binaries ranging from your own piece of
code to real applications like Safari.
This is accomplished without leaving traces on the hard disk and without creating a new process, since the whole
exploitation is performed in memory.
If an attacker is able to execute code in the target machine, it is possible to run this attack instead of a classic shellcode and to use it
as a trampoline for higher-lever payloads.
Other similar payloads like meterpreter or meterpretux exist but none of them is able to run on Mac OS X. Besides many of those techniques require to run
specific crafted binaries, that way precompiled applications are left out from the possible range of payloads.

Vincenzo Iozzo is a student at the Politecnico di Milano where he does some research regarding malware and IDS. He is involved
in a number of open source projects, including FreeBSD due to Google Summer of Code. He also works as a security consultant for Secure Network,
an Italian company, and as a reverse engineer for Zynamics.

## Prajakta Jagdale

### Blinded by Flash: Widespread Security Risks Flash Developers Don't See

In this presentation I will examine the Flash framework and then delve into
the Flash security model and the transitions it has undergone over the years. To
explore the avenues of compromise in the security model, I will use a test Flash
application and demonstrate various attack vectors including Cross-Site Request
Forgery, data injection and script injection. During this demonstration, I will
explain the associated threats in detail and discuss means to mitigate these
threats. Even though the test application validates the attack surface, the
question remains: how many applications actually deployed are vulnerable to
these threats? I will answer this question by providing astonishing statistics
about vulnerable, real world applications I was able to find using simple
Google queries.

Prajakta Jagdale is a Research Engineer with the HP Web Security Research Group. Prajakta focuses on
automated discovery of Web application vulnerabilities and crawling technologies. Her current research efforts are concentrated towards
identifying security risks associated with RIA technologies. This research involves developing innovative techniques to enable automated
web assessment tools to crawl and analyze RIA applications through the use of both static source code analysis and dynamic runtime analysis.

## William Kimball

### Emulation-based Software Protection Providing Encrypted Code Execution and Page Granularity Code Signing

We present an original emulation-based software protection scheme providing
protection from reverse code engineering (RCE) and software exploitation using
encrypted code execution and page-granularity code signing, respectively.
Protection mechanisms execute in trusted emulators while remaining out-of-band
of untrusted systems being emulated. This protection scheme is called SecureQEMU
and is based on a modified version of Quick Emulator. RCE uncovers the internal
workings of a program. It is used during vulnerability and intellectual property
(IP) discovery. To protect from RCE program code may have anti-disassembly,
anti-debugging, and obfuscation techniques incorporated. These techniques slow
the process of RCE, however, once defeated protected code is still
comprehensible. Encryption provides static code protection, but encrypted code
must be decrypted before execution. SecureQEMUs' scheme overcomes this
limitation by keeping code encrypted during execution. Software exploitation
leverages design and implementation errors to cause unintended behavior which
may result in security policy violations. Traditional exploitation protection
mechanisms provide a blacklist approach to software protection. Specially
crafted exploit payloads bypass these protection mechanisms. SecureQEMU
provides a whitelist approach to software protection by executing signed code
exclusively. Unsigned malicious code (exploits, backdoors, rootkits, etc.)
remain unexecuted, therefore, protecting the system.

### QuietRIATT: Rebuilding the Import Address Table Using Hooked DLL Calls

For a Reverse Engineer, rebuilding a large Import Address Table (IAT) can
be a very time-consuming and tedious process. When the IAT has been
sufficiently hashed and current IAT rebuilders fail to resolve any of the calls,
there is little other choice than to rebuild it by hand. Depending on the size,
it can take days or even weeks. Also, doing anything by hand is prone to
mistakes.

QuietRIATT is an IDA Pro plug-in which automates the process of rebuilding
the IAT when it canât be done by current IAT tools. Not only can it greatly
reduce the amount of time spent rebuilding by hand, it also removes the element
of human error.

Brian Krumheuer is a Reverse Engineer for the Software Security Team at Riverside Research Institute. He worked for over eight years in IT and Software Development before entering the field of Reverse Engineering. Currently, he plays a vital role on the team by developing many ring-3 and ring-0 reverse engineering tools for both Windows and Linux.

### Satellite Hacking for Fun and Profit

Ever wondered just how much data and how many services are being beamed down at you from space right now? We all know there are thousands
of channels out there, but how can we make sense of them all? How can we find the stuff "they" don't want us to know about? Is there any
such stuff? What can we do with it once we've found it? Will we go blind, like mother told us?

Adam Laurie Adam Laurie is a freelance security consultant working the in the field of electronic communications. He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and, with help from his brother Ben, wrote the world's first CD ripper, 'CDGRAB'. At this point, he and Ben became interested in the newly emerging concept of 'The Internet', and were involved in various early open source projects, the most well known of which is probably their ownâ'Apache-SSL'âwhich went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. Since the late Nineties they have focused their attention on security, and have been the authors of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centres (housed in underground nuclear bunkers) as secure hosting facilities. Adam has been a senior member of staff at DEFCON since 1997, and also acted as a member of staff during the early years of the Black Hat Briefings, and is a member of the Bluetooth SIG Security Experts Group and speaks regularly on the international conference circuit on matters concerning Bluetooth security.

### Making Privacy-Preserving Data Mining Practical with Smartcards

Data mining provides large benefits to the commercial, government and homeland security sectors, but the aggregation and storage of huge amounts of data about
citizens inevitably leads to erosion of privacy. To achieve the benefits that data mining has to offer, while at the same time enhancing privacy, we need
technological solutions that simultaneously enable data mining while preserving privacy. This need has been recognized by the US government, as can be seen
in the February 2008 [report](http://www.dni.gov/reports/data_mining_report_feb08.pdf) on data mining by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (see pages 9-12).
In this presentation, we demonstrate surprisingly simple and extraordinarily efficient protocols for a number of non-trivial tasks related to privacy-preserving data mining.
Our protocols use standard smartcards and standard smartcard infrastructure, and are the first truly practical solutions for these problems that provide strong security guarantees.

Andrew Lindell is the Chief Cryptographer at Aladdin Knowledge Systems and an Assistant Professor at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.
Andrew attained a Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 2002 and spent two years at the IBM T.J.Watson research lab as a Postdoctoral fellow in the
cryptography research group. Andrew has carried out extensive research in cryptography, and has published more than 50 conference and journal publications,
as well as an undergraduate textbook on cryptography and a book detailing secure protocols. Andrew has presented at numerous international conferences, workshops

he joined Aladdin Knowledge Systems in 2004. In his position as Chief Cryptographer, he has worked on the cryptographic and security issues that arise in the design
and construction of authentication schemes, smartcard applications, software protection schemes and more. Offering a unique combination of academic and industry experience,
Andrew brings a fresh and insightful perspective on many of the crucial security issues that arise today.

## David Litchfield

### The Forensic Investigation of a Compromised Oracle Database Server

Database Forensics expert David Litchfield will discuss his new tool and paper. The tool, orablock, allows a forensic investigator to dump data from a "cold" Oracle data file - i.e. there's no need
to load up the data file in the database which would cause the data file to be modified, so using orablock preserves the evidence. Orablock can
also be used to locate "stale" data - i.e. data that has been deleted or updated. It can also be used to dump SCNs for data blocks which can be
useful during the examination of a compromised Oracle box.

David Litchfield specializes in searching for new threats to database systems and web applications. He has lectured to both
British and U.S. government security agencies on database security and is a regular speaker at the Blackhat Security Briefings. He is a co-author of "The
Database Hacker's Handbook", "The Shellcoder's Handbook", "SQL Server Security", and "Special Ops". In his spare time he is the Chief Scientist of Next

## Moxie Marlinspike

### New Techniques for Defeating SSL/TLS

This presentation will demonstrate some new tools and techniques that
allow attackers to silently alter, inject, and log traffic intended for
secure transmission by SSL/TLS in common web applications such as online
banking or secure webmail logins. It builds off of the SSL exploit
tools and research on the failure of browsers to validate
BasicConstraints that I published in 2002, and will include
demonstrations of a new tool for exploiting current use patterns as well
as some data gathered from field testing in the real world.

Moxie Marlinspike has shied away
from the professional security
community since its emergence, and tends to hang out with the wrong
crowd instead. He's a fellow at the Hack The Planet Institute of
Pittsburgh, and in his spare time he rides freight trains across the
country or sails derelict boats across oceans.

### Windows Vista Security Internals

This presentation will describe in detail some of the specific changes in
Windows Vista's security internals. Focus is on actual security modules and
functions relevant to authentication, passwords, network communications and
IPSec enhancements. The primary purpose of this presentation is to provide the
audience with an overview of what these changes entail, the knowledge necessary
to modify existing or craft new tools, and to explore and understand the risks
present within the new security architecture. Potential areas of vulnerability
will be presented and discussed in detail. These changes were primarily
discovered through a lot of research, security testing and reverse engineering
tasks and will be presented in this context. This talk is NOT about DEP, ASLR
and other enhancements in Vista that have already been adequately covered
elsewhere. The main benefits of application of this knowledge will fall into the
post-exploitation arena.

Michael Muckin is the Team Lead for the Lockheed Martin Security Engineering Test Team where he regularly performs
penetration tests, vuln research, reverse engineering, product assessments and other various security tasks. Prior to LM, Michael worked at Foundstone

## Duc Nguyen

### Your Face Is NOT Your Password

Biometrics has nowadays been of universal interest and has been developed and
used for many purposes such as for the detection of criminals and undesirables,
identification and access control. Within this paper, we would like to concern
about Facial Cognitive Biometric Systems and their application in User
Authentication Based on Face Recognition.

Lenovo, Asus, and Toshiba are known as the first three big computer
manufacturers to put that technology into practical use and to bring about
greater convenience for their customers. The one question to ask is whether such
technology is really safe and secure for its users to enjoy.

My research, which is concluded in this paper, will prove that the mechanisms
used by those three vendors havenât met the security requirements needed by an
authentication system and that they cannot wholly protected their users from
being tampered.

Mr. Duc Nguyen is senior researcher of Bkis. He is the manager of the Application Security Department. He also takes part in developing
Bkav Anti-Virus and Bkav Firewall, the most well-known security software in Vietnam. His responsibilities cover both technical and management aspects of

### **Alternate:** Transparent Emergency Data Destruction

Transparent Emergency Data Destruction allows a user to destroy information quickly and discreetely when facing an adversary.
When the computer is booted, the user will be prompted for a password. In the event of an emergency, the user can enter a duress password,
which will render their data inaccessible before booting to a discreet desktop environment.

The proof of concept is done in Ubuntu Linux. It uses a standard full disk encryption utility, a read-only installation of the basic
operating system, and modified boot scripts. The time spent destroying data is negligible compared to the time it takes to boot the operating
system, and the performance penalties during operation are minor.

Warren Roberts is a research scientist with the Institute for Information Security (ISEC) at the University of Tulsa. He started out with ISEC's research into Risk-Adaptive Access Control, but has moved on to spear-head the research into Transparent Emergency Data Destruction.

## Peter Silberman

### Snort My Memory

For almost a decade Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been a
critical technology used by network security professionals to identify attacks
against their infrastructure. There are numerous sources producing signatures
for the latest malware outbreak or âPatch Tuesdayâ exploit. In many
circumstances, these network-based indicators exist in host memory and can be
detected using the same signatures that are used in NIDS products. This
presentation introduces a method for using these network-based signatures to
identify hosts with malware or shellcode present using memory forensic analysis
techniques. The benefits of using snort signatures in memory are: malware may
not have sent the strings over the network yet; and malware that encrypts
strings over the network may have decrypted strings in memory prior to calling
into some encryption library. The talk concludes with the introduction of
MindSniffer, a new tool that converts a Snort IDS signature to a Memoryzeâ¢
filter. The demo uses existing signatures, converts them to filters and shows
how these filters can identify malware or potential shellcode in live system
memory or acquired memory images.

Peter Silberman works at MANDIANT on the product development team. For a number of years, Peter has specialized
in offensive and defensive kernel technologies, reverse engineering, and vulnerability discovery. He enjoys automating solutions to problems both

### Dissecting Web Attacks

Attackers have been increasingly using the web and client side attacks in order to steal information from targets. Some of the more interesting
and wide spread attacks seem to be originating from countries like China and Russia. This talk will describe some of these attacks in detail including
how they are achieving large numbers of penetrations, their web infrastructures and some of the mistakes they have made which have allowed us to track
them back further. This information will provide some evidence as to where these attacks are truly originating from and what their purposes are.

Val Smith has been involved in the computer security community and industry for over ten years. He currently
works as a professional security researcher on a variety of problems in the security community. He specializes in penetration testing (over 40,000 machines assessed),
reverse engineering and malware research. He works on the Metasploit Project development team as well as other vulnerability development efforts. Most recently
Valsmith founded Attack Research which is devoted to deep understanding of the mechanics of computer attack. Previously Valsmith founded Offensive Computing,

### A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: The Dangers of Persistent Web Browser Storage

As the line between desktop and web applications becomes increasingly blurry
in a web 2.0 world, browser functionality is being pushed well beyond what it
was originally intended for. Persistent client side storage has become a
requirement for web applications if they are to be available both online and
off. This need is being filled by a variety of technologies such as persistent
cookies, Flash storage and Google Gears. While all such technologies offer great
promise, it is clear that the vast majority of developers simply do not
understand their security implications.

Researching a variety of currently deployed implementations of these
technologies has revealed a broad scope of vulnerabilities with frightening
implications. Now attackers can target victims not just once, but every time
they visit a site as the victim now carries and stores the attack with them.
Imagine a scenario whereby updated confidential information is forwarded to an
attacker every time a victim interacts with a given we application. The attacker
no longer needs to worry about timing their attacks to ensure that the victim is
authenticated as the victim attacks himself! Limited storage? Cookies that
expire? Not a problem when entire databases are accessible with virtually
unlimited storage and an infinite lifespan. Think these attacks are theoretical?
Think again. In this talk we dive into these technologies and break down the
risk posed by them when not properly understood. We will then detail a variety
of real-world vulnerabilities that have been uncovered, including a new class of
cross-site scripting.

## Paul Wouters

### Defending Your DNS in a Post-Kaminsky World

The Kaminsky bug sent everyone scrambling to fix their DNS. Or did it? While
nearly all of the big DNS providers have taken measures, most of the smaller
players are still vulnerable. People are afraid to make changes to their DNS
infrastructure, and although the world is moving towards DNSSEC, that will not
be reality for at least another two years.

Contrary to popular belief, the IETF is not leaving people in the dark
until they adopt DNSSEC. It has come up with some viable workarounds that can be
deployed. This presentation will teach the counter measures that can be taken
with minimal changes to currently deployed DNS infrastructure. And heck, we'll
even explain Bernstein's dnscurve.

Paul Wouters is often involved with cryptography, digital rights and cypherpunk projects. He co-founded "Xtended Internet", one
of the first the Dutch ISP's back in 1996. In 2003 he co-founded Xelerance, a company specialised in VPN technology that develops and maintains "Openswan", the Linux IPsec software.
He has been involved with the deployment of DNSSEC worldwide, and is an active IETF and RIPE contributor. In 2006 he published "Building and integrating Virtual Private Networks with
Openswan". He currently maintains various cryptographic software and DNS related packages for Red Hat's Fedora and RHEL Linux, including the popular Instant Messenger encryption
software "Off the Record". If not travelling, he can regularly be found at Toronto's HackLab collective.

## Stefano Zanero

### **Alternate**: Masibty: A Web Application Firewall Based on Anomaly Detection

During this talk we will focus on why current web application firewalls and IPSs are basically useless, since they are misuse based (e.g. rely on rules). Since misuse
detectors are unable to keep up with evolving attack schemes, evasion techniques, and custom applications, better anomaly detectors are badly needed. Masibty is an anomaly
detection reverse proxy, aimed at detecting web application attacks. It is able to detect zero-day attacks (the real thing, not a marketing-tainted redefinition) after an
initial live training which does not require attack-free data. Modularized for easy extension, in its current implementation it is able to detect and block anomalies in the
DOM tree - therefore blocking XSS attacks - and in application parameters. It is resilient to URL rewriting, and it was tested against in-the-wild exploits collected from
the usual sources over a number of months, with the use of various forms of evasion.

 Stefano Zanero received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the Politecnico of Milano technical university, where he
is an Assistant Professor. His current research interests include the development of Intrusion Detection Systems based on unsupervised learning algorithms, security of web
applications and computer virology. He has been a speaker at international scientific and technical conferences, and he is the author and co-author of books and articles
published in international, peer reviewed journals and conferences. He is a member of the board of the "Journal in Computer Virology", and acts as a reviewer for the "ACM
Computing Reviews" and "IEEE Security&Privacy", as well as various primary international conferences. He is a member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers), the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), and a founding member of the Italian Chapter of ISSA (Information Systems Security Association), for which he
sits in the International Board of Directors. He has also been a columnist for Computer World Italy, and has been awarded a journalism award in 2003. Since 2004 he is a
partner and CTO of Secure Network, a firm specializing in information security training and consulting, based in Milan.

## Earl Zmijewski

### Defending Against BGP Man-In-The-Middle Attacks

At DEFCON 16, Alex Pilosov and Tony Kapela presented a new BGP attack in
which traffic to a victim is hijacked, but then transparently routed to the
intended recipient. This allows for wholesale eavesdropping, including
alteration, of all incoming traffic to the victim. In this talk, we review
enough BGP routing background to understand the threat and how it breaks the
trust model inherent in Internet routing. Then we review possible detection
mechanisms via data aggregation from global route collection. The tip-off to
such attacks includes prefix de-aggregation, invalid originations, invalid AS
adjacencies, and even improbable AS paths. Detection techniques depend whether
or not you know ground truth, i.e., if you are looking to defend your own
network or simply observe such hijacks in the wild. We conclude with case
studies of applying these techniques to global routing data.

Earl Zmijewski is responsible for all of Renesys's Internet Data
software, services and operations. He has over 20 years of experience
encompassing scientific computing and most areas of IT, with particular
emphasis on networking and security. Before Renesys, Earl spent over 12

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-15

## URL spoofing with box drawing character

Announced
April 21, 2009
Reporter
Bjoern Hoehrmann, Moxie Marlinspike
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.9
* SeaMonkey 1.1.15
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.21

### Description

**Bjoern Hoehrmann** and security researcher **Moxie
Marlinspike** independently reported
that Unicode box drawing characters were allowed in Internationalized
Domain Names (IDN) where they could be visually confused with
punctuation used in valid web addresses. This could be combined with
a phishing-type scam to trick a victim into thinking they were on a
different website than they actually were.
