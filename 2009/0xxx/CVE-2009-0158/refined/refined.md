      "source": "support.apple.com_a6b399f3_20250124_155304.html",
      "summary": "A stack buffer overflow exists in the telnet command. Connecting to a TELNET server with a very long canonical name in its DNS address record may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking."

      "summary": "Apple has released multiple Security Updates, 2009-002 / Mac OS X version 10.5.7 and Safari 3.2.3, to correct multiple vulnerabilities affecting Apple Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server, and the Safari web browser. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, gain access to sensitive information, or cause a denial of service. These updates also address vulnerabilities in other vendors' products that ship with Apple Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server.  Potential consequences include arbitrary code execution, sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, or privilege escalation. Solution: Install Apple Security Update 2009-002 / Mac OS X v10.5.7, or Safari 3.2.3."
