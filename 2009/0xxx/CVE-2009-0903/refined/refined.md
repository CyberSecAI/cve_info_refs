Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the relevant information regarding CVE-2009-0903:

**CVE-2009-0903 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents.** However, there are two APARs, **PK87767** and **PK81944**, which contain a vulnerability related to SOAPAction and binding exposure that are relevant to a CVE.

**Analysis of PK87767:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The document lists **PK72138: No SOAPAction + Binding at operation level causes exposure.** This indicates a vulnerability where the absence of a SOAPAction header combined with binding information only being present at the operation level can lead to exposure.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper enforcement of SOAPAction combined with how binding information is handled. The missing SOAPAction and operation-level binding can potentially expose the web service to unexpected or unauthorized requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The document itself does not explicitly state the impact of this exposure. However, such a vulnerability could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of web services.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through sending SOAP messages without the required SOAPAction header, potentially exploiting a misconfiguration in the web service implementation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send SOAP requests to the affected web service. No special privileges are mentioned, so the attack can be performed remotely.

**Analysis of PK81944:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Similar to PK87767, this document lists **PK72138 No SOAPAction + bindings only at operation level causes exposure**. This is the same vulnerability reported in the previous APAR but in a different context.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The weakness is the same as the previous APAR, related to missing SOAPAction with operation level binding leading to exposure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Same as above, this vulnerability could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of web services, as mentioned in the PK87767 case.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector remains the same as PK87767, sending SOAP messages without the required SOAPAction header.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to send SOAP requests to the affected web service and no special privileges are required.

**Additional Information:**

*   Both APARs (PK87767 and PK81944) are for different versions of IBM WebSphere Application Server (6.1 and 7.0 respectively), indicating the vulnerability was present in multiple versions.
*   The vulnerability related to PK72138 seems to be a common thread between these two fixes, indicating a recurring issue in how SOAPAction and binding information is handled.

**Conclusion:**

While the document does not explicitly mention CVE-2009-0903, the included APARs, specifically PK72138, provide information about a vulnerability regarding missing SOAPAction with operation level binding, that can lead to exposure. This vulnerability is addressed in both WebSphere Application Server v6.1 (via PK87767) and v7.0 (via PK81944).
