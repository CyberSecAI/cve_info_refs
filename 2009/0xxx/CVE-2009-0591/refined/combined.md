# [PHP North West Conference](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk/)

[21-Jul-2009]

The [PHP North West
Conference](http://conference.phpnw.org.uk) has announced its return for a second year, to be held
on Saturday 10th October 2009 in Manchester, UK. This is a one-day
conference aimed at developers from the local region and further
afield, with a deliberately low ticket price to ensure everyone who
wants to attend can do so. We combine experienced speakers with some
new local talent to bring an event that truly has something for
everyone and a great buzz.

The official conference is on the Saturday but there are social events
on Friday and Saturday and an informal schedule on Sunday, so come and
make a weekend of it with us in Manchester! All the venues are in
central Manchester and walkable from mainline public transport, so do
join us.

There is a call for papers which runs until 16th August 2009 and the
early bird ticket prices are fixed until September 10th. For more

# [Subversion Migration Complete](http://www.php.net/archive/2009.php#id2009-07-16-1)

[16-Jul-2009]

The migration from CVS to Subversion is complete. The web interface is at
[svn.php.net](http://svn.php.net). You can read about it at
[php.net/svn.php](http://php.net/svn.php),
[wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq](http://wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq). The
URL to feed to your svn client is http://svn.php.net/repository.

There is also a [github mirror](http://github.com/php). Please
use that instead of trying to do a full git clone from the svn repository. See
the instructions at [wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq#git](http://wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq#git)

Many thanks to Gwynne who did the bulk of the work and also all the other folks who pitched in.
It was a major effort to move 14 years of CVS history to another RCS.

# [2009 PHP TestFest](http://www.php.net/archive/2009.php#id2009-07-09-1)

[09-Jul-2009]

So finally we are at the end of the
[2009 PHP TestFest](http://wiki.php.net/qa/testfest).
It has been an outstanding success with the
[coverage increasing](http://gcov.php.net/PHP_5_3/lcov_html/)
by about 2.5% overall and 887 new tests contributed in the TestFest SVN
repository of which 637 have already been added to PHP CVS.

[User groups](http://wiki.php.net/usergroups) from all
over the world have worked hard to make this happen and we thank
[each and every one of you](http://results.testfest.php.net)
for your contribution to PHP!
You really made a difference to the PHP5.3 release quality.

There still are few loose ends to tie up - the
[TestFest SVN repository](http://testfest.php.net/repos/testfest/)
will be *closed* for contributions later this week and the last few
tests will be moved into the main PHP repository. Finally, we have
[10 elePHPants](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=elephpants&m=tags)
and [9 TestFest mugs](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=testfest+mug&m=tags)
to give out. The winners of mugs and elePHPants
will be drawn at random from a list of people who wrote tests;
the winner's names will be announced later this month.

For those that would like to continue to make a difference by
writing tests there are two options. You can simply continue by
submitting new tests to the [QA mailing list](http://php.net/mailinglists),
or, if you have written a significant number of tests you might
consider applying for your own
[PHP CVS (or SVN) ID](http://php.net/cvs-php).
In your application you should reference the tests that you have
written in support of your application.

Last but not least, we would like to thank all of the
companies and institutions that sponsored TestFest.
These include Combell, Corretgé, Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia, IBM,
iBuildings, Itera, Mayflower, Microsoft, Nexen (Alter Way Group), php|architect,
Redpill-Linpro, Steinigke Showtechnic, Verges Council and Zend.

# [TestFest 2009](http://www.php.net/archive/2009.php#id2009-05-09-1)

[09-May-2009]

TestFest is upon us once again. For those who don't know, this is the
time of year where User Groups and individuals donate a little of their
time and effort to increasing the test coverage of PHP.

Hundreds of thousands of lines of code are working in concert to
assemble one of the simplest to learn and fastest running scripting
languages in the business. All this is achieved with the expectation
that very few bugs will make it into releases and the ones that do
will be stomped out quickly, efficiently and will never be heard from
again. This is a lofty goal and is only possible through a system of
tests designed to continuously evaluate the well-being of PHP.

This year the QA Team has been very busy implementing new features
and improvements to make the TestFest experience easier and more
enjoyable than ever before. Some these improvements include a
Subversion repository for test storage and tracking, a Virtual
Machine for simple test environment setup, and improved documentation
of testing procedures.

2009 is looking to be the most successful TestFest event ever. Over
20 User Groups spanning Belgium, Brazil, Catalonia, Canada, France,
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, USA and the UK
have already registered. This is an incredible response and we still
have 2 months left to go.

Getting involved couldn't be simpler. Visit the
[QA TestFest page](http://qa.php.net/testfest.php) to
find out how you can organize a TestFest event in your community.
We are looking forward to seeing your communities tests being
committed into PHP.

# [PHP 5.3.0RC2 Release Announcement](http://www.php.net/archive/2009.php#id2009-05-07-1)

[07-May-2009]

The PHP development team is proud to announce the second release candidate of PHP 5.3.0 (PHP 5.3.0RC2).
This RC focuses on bug fixes and stability improvements, and we hope only minimal changes are required
for the next candidate (RC3).

Expect an RC3 in 2-3 weeks, although there will not be major changes so now is a good
time to start the final testing of PHP 5.3.0 before it gets released, in order to find
possible incompatibilities with your project.

Please download and test this release candidate, and report any issues found.
Downloads and further information is available at [qa.php.net](http://qa.php.net/).

# [PHP 5.3.0RC1 Release Announcement](http://www.php.net/archive/2009.php#id2009-03-24-1)

[24-Mar-2009]

The PHP development team is proud to announce the availability of the first release candidate of PHP 5.3.0 (PHP 5.3.0RC1). This release marks the final phase in a major improvement in the 5.X series, which includes a large number of new features, bug fixes and security enhancements.

The key features of the PHP 5.3 branch include:

* Support for [namespaces](http://php.net/namespaces)
* Under the hood performance improvements
* [Late static binding](http://php.net/lsb)
* [Lambda functions and closures](http://docs.php.net/functions.anonymous)
* Syntax additions:
  [NOWDOC](http://php.net/manual/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc), limited GOTO,
  [ternary short cut "?:"](http://php.net/ternary#language.operators.comparison.ternary) and
  [\_\_callStatic()](http://php.net/__callstatic)
* Optional [garbage collection](http://php.net/gc_enable) for cyclic references
* Optional [mysqlnd](http://php.net/mysqli.mysqlnd) PHP native replacement for libmysql
* Improved [windows](http://windows.php.net) support including VC6 and VC9 binaries
* More consistent float rounding
* Deprecation notices are now handle via E\_DEPRECATED (part of E\_ALL) instead of the E\_STRICT error level
* Several enhancements to enable more [flexiblity in php.ini](http://php.net/ini.sections) (and ini parsing in general)
* New bundled extensions:
  [ext/phar](http://php.net/phar),
  [ext/intl](http://php.net/intl),
  [ext/fileinfo](http://php.net/fileinfo),
  [ext/sqlite3](http://php.net/sqlite3),
  [ext/enchant](http://php.net/enchant)
* Countless bug fixes and improvements to existing extensions in particular to:
  [ext/openssl](http://php.net/openssl),
  [ext/spl](http://php.net/spl) and
  [ext/date](http://php.net/datetime)

This release also drops several extensions and unifies usage of internal APIs. Users should be aware of the following known backwards compatibility breaks:

* Parameter parsing API unification will cause some functions to behave more or less strict when it comes to type juggling
* Removed the following extensions:
  [ext/mhash](http://php.net/mhash) (see [ext/hash](http://php.net/hash)),
  [ext/msql](http://php.net/msql),
  [ext/pspell](http://php.net/pspell) (see [ext/enchant](http://php.net/enchant)),
  [ext/sybase](http://php.net/sybase) (see [ext/sybase\_ct](http://php.net/sybase))
* Moved the following extensions to PECL:
  [ext/ming](http://php.net/ming),
  [ext/fbsql](http://php.net/fbsql),
  [ext/ncurses](http://php.net/ncurses),
  [ext/fdf](http://php.net/fdf)
* Removed [zend.ze1\_compatibility\_mode](http://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.zend.ze1-compatibility-mode)
* See the [upgrading guide](http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/UPGRADING?view=markup&pathrev=PHP_5_3) for other minor changes

All users of PHP, especially those using earlier PHP 5 releases are advised to test this release as the final release of PHP 5.3.0 will eventually obsolete the 5.2 branch of PHP.

For users upgrading from previous PHP 5 releases there is an upgrading guide available [here](http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/UPGRADING?view=markup&pathrev=PHP_5_3), detailing the changes between those releases and PHP 5.3.0.

Please also note that we are aware of issues surrounding float/integer handling in some edge cases (some of which have been introduced in PHP 5.2.0), as well as a crash bug in NSAPI, that will be fixed in PHP 5.3.0RC2. These issues however do not prevent wide spread testing of PHP 5.3.0RC1 as users can now rely on the feature set and implementation decisions no longer being changed.

For a full list of changes in PHP 5.3.0, see the CVS [NEWS](http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/NEWS?view=markup&pathrev=PHP_5_3) file.

- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.
Affected products: SUSE CORE 9, SLE 10
- kdegraphics3
This update fixes security problems while decoding JBIG2.
(CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-0165, CVE-2009-0166,
CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-0800, CVE-2009-1179, CVE-2009-1180,
CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1182, CVE-2009-1183)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libopenssl-devel/openssl/compat-openssl097g
This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
