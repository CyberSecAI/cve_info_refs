  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by applying the Apache patch for version 2.0.63. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/> Apache 2.0.x is only shipped with Mac OS X Server v10.4.x systems. Mac OS X v10.5.x and Mac OS X Server v10.5.x ship with Apache 2.2.x.

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2939

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache 2.2.9's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by updating Apache to version 2.2.11. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/>

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-0456

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Web sites that allow users to control the name of a served file may be vulnerable to HTTP response injection

  Description: A request forgery issue exists in Apache. Apache does not escape filenames when negotiating the correct content type to send to a remote browser. A user who can publish files with specially crafted names to a web site can substitute their own response for any web page hosted on the system. This update addresses the issue by escaping filenames in content negotiation responses.

* **ATS**

* **BIND**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0025

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: BIND is susceptible to a spoofing attack if configured to use DNSSEC

  Description: BIND incorrectly checks the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protocol, a maliciously crafted DSA certificate could bypass the validation, which may lead to a spoofing attack. By default, DNSSEC is not enabled. This update addresses the issue by updating BIND to version 9.3.6-P1 on Mac OS X v10.4, and version 9.4.3-P1 for Mac OS X v10.5 systems. Further information is available via the ISC web site at <https://www.isc.org/>
