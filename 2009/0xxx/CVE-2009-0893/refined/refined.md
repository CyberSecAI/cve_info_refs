      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper bounds check when parsing resync markers in bitstream"

        "Crafted video bitstream",
        "Processing a malformed Xvid video file"

       "additional_notes": "This issue was reported by IBM X-Force. The fix was backported from HEAD to release-1_2-branch, and also applied to the main branch in revision 1.81."

     "weaknesses": [
        "Improper error handling for memory allocation failures in the DirectShow frontend"

      "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to incorrect return values and unpredictable behavior in the DirectShow filter if a memory allocation fails during decoding.",

      "additional_notes": "This issue was reported by IBM X-Force. The fix was to return E_FAIL instead of S_FALSE upon XVID_ERR_MEMORY error."
