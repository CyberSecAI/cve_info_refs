Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect check of the return value of the `EVP_VerifyFinal` function in the `tqsllib` library. This function is part of OpenSSL and is used to verify digital signatures. The library was checking for a non-zero return value instead of a return value greater than zero, which allowed for malformed signatures to be incorrectly validated as valid signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Return Value Check:** The core issue is that `tqsllib` used `!EVP_VerifyFinal(...)` which only checked for a zero return value. `EVP_VerifyFinal` can return -1 in case of error. The correct check should be `EVP_VerifyFinal(...) <= 0` to catch all invalid signature scenarios including OpenSSL errors.
*   **Bypass of Signature Verification:** This oversight allowed a malformed signature to bypass the intended validation process, posing a security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Certificate Validation:** An attacker could craft a malformed signature that would be incorrectly accepted by the vulnerable software.
*   **Potential for Unauthorized Actions:** By bypassing the signature validation, an attacker could potentially perform actions that would normally be prevented by the signature validation process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed SSL/TLS Signatures:** The vulnerability is exploitable by providing a malformed signature within an SSL/TLS communication context. This would involve an attacker intercepting or crafting a malicious certificate chain with an invalid signature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle or Malicious Endpoint:** An attacker would likely need to be in a position to intercept or generate communication involving the vulnerable software. This could include man-in-the-middle attacks or controlling a malicious endpoint sending data to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Signature Structure:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed signature that bypasses the flawed check but still "looks" correct to the vulnerable code.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2008-5077 which is an OpenSSL flaw regarding the handling of return values by EVP\_VerifyFinal.
*   The fix involves changing the conditional check from `!EVP_VerifyFinal(...)` to `EVP_VerifyFinal(...) <= 0`.
*   The vulnerability was present in `tqsllib` 2.0 and was fixed in version 2.0-8 of the Debian package.
*   Red Hat also issued updates for Fedora 9 and 10 to address this vulnerability.
*   The issue affects applications that use the flawed signature verification within tqsllib, not OpenSSL directly.
