| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c0)  Eddy Chan    2008-10-01 23:51:18 UTC  ``` Along the same lines with CR 29936, com.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig.tldDigester has an issue with initialization.  Basically, the TldConfig's parser can be initialized with the webapp's XML parser, which causes a security problem, since it has permission issues with reading files.  This is caused by a similar scenario to CR 29936:  1) Remove all stock webapps that come with the standard installation.  This includes the ones in server/webapps.  Remember to remove the configurations in conf/Catalina. 2) Add a webapp that has a XML parser located in WEB-INF/lib.  For instance, one from sourceforge or Apache Xerces. 3) Add a library containing a .tld file in META-INF like Spring. 4) In order to actually have a log containing the error, you need to enable logging.  For example, by following the instructions laid out in <http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/logging.html>.  I used log4j. 5) Start the appserver in secure mode.  You should see an error in the log similar to the following:  ERROR main org.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig - Exception processing TLD META-INF/spring-form.tld in JAR at resource path TOMCAT_PATH/webapps/MY_WAR/WEB-INF/lib/spring.jar in context /MY_WAR java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission TOMCAT_PATH/common/lib/jsp-api.jar read)         at

1](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c1)  Eddy Chan    2008-10-02 01:06:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 22666](attachment.cgi?id=22666 "Test webapp that demonstrates error") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=22666&action=edit "Test webapp that demonstrates error") Test webapp that demonstrates error ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c2)  Mark Thomas    2008-10-02 04:18:41 UTC  ``` I am unable to reproduce this. Looking at your stack trace the security exception is caused when trying to read jsp-api.jar. This jar should never be scanned as it is on the exclude list so I don't understand how you can be seeing this error.  Reviewing the code does show that there is an issue. Additionally, the XML validation settings of the first context precessed are used for all contexts. I can fix these issues based purely on code review but it would be nice to be able to confirm the fix with a test case. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c3)  Mark Thomas    2008-10-03 04:54:19 UTC  ``` Ignore my previous. I now have a test case.  Thanks for the report. This has been fixed in trunk and proposed for 6.0.x and 5.5.x. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c4)  Mark Thomas    2009-01-31 00:26:49 UTC  ``` This has been fixed 6.0.x and will be included in 6.0.19 onwards. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c5)  Mark Thomas    2009-04-08 10:20:50 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 46549](show_bug.cgi?id=46549 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Leak caused by org.apache.tomcat.util.digester.Digester not releasing the XMLReader") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c6)  Mark Thomas    2009-06-03 13:56:05 UTC  ``` The patch has been applied to 5.5.x and will be included in 5.5.28 onwards. ``` |  |

### Apache Tomcat 5.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 5.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 5.0.x and 5.5.x are no longer supported.
Further vulnerabilities in the 5.0.x and 5.5.x branches will not be
fixed. Users should upgrade to 8.5.x or later to obtain security fixes.
Vulnerabilities fixed in Tomcat 5.5.26 onwards have not been assessed to
determine if they are present in the 5.0.x branch.**

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 5.5 those are
[`building.html`](/tomcat-5.5-doc/building.html)
in documentation (`webapps/tomcat-docs` subdirectory of
a binary distributive) and `BUILDING.txt` file in a source
distributive.

If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
here, please send your questions to the public
[Tomcat Users mailing list](lists.html)

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other
unexpected behaviour that has [security
impact](security-impact.html), or if the descriptions here are incomplete,
please report them privately to the
[Tomcat Security Team](security.html). Thank you.

### released 10 Oct 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.36

**Moderate: DIGEST authentication weakness**
[CVE-2012-3439](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3439)

Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication
were identified and resolved:

1. Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.
2. When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.
3. The user name and password were not checked before when indicating
   that a nonce was stale.

These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making
replay attacks possible in some circumstances.

This was fixed in revision [1392248](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1392248).

The first issue was reported by Tilmann Kuhn to the Tomcat security team
on 19 July 2012. The second and third issues were discovered by the
Tomcat security team during the resulting code review. All three issues
were made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.35

### released 16 Jan 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.35

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-0022](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0022)

Analysis of the recent hash collision vulnerability identified unrelated
inefficiencies with Apache Tomcat's handling of large numbers of
parameters and parameter values. These inefficiencies could allow an
attacker, via a specially crafted request, to cause large amounts of CPU
to be used which in turn could create a denial of service. The issue was
addressed by modifying the Tomcat parameter handling code to efficiently
process large numbers of parameters and parameter values.

This was fixed in revisions [1221282](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1221282),
[1224640](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1224640) and
[1228191](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1228191).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 21 October 2011 and
made public on 17 January 2012.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.34

### released 22 Sep 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.34

**Moderate: Multiple weaknesses in HTTP DIGEST authentication**
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184)

Note: Mitre elected to break this issue down into multiple issues and
have allocated the following additional references to parts of this
issue:
[CVE-2011-5062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5062),
[CVE-2011-5063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5063) and
[CVE-2011-5064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5064). The Apache Tomcat security team will
continue to treat this as a single issue using the reference
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184).

The implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication was discovered to have
several weaknesses:

* replay attacks were permitted
* server nonces were not checked
* client nonce counts were not checked
* qop values were not checked
* realm values were not checked
* the server secret was hard-coded to a known string

The result of these weaknesses is that DIGEST authentication was only as
secure as BASIC authentication.

This was fixed in [revision 1159309](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1159309).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 16 March 2011 and
made public on 26 September 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.33

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2204](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2204)

When using the MemoryUserDatabase (based on tomcat-users.xml) and
creating users via JMX, an exception during the user creation process may
trigger an error message in the JMX client that includes the user's
password. This error message is also written to the Tomcat logs. User
passwords are visible to administrators with JMX access and/or
administrators with read access to the tomcat-users.xml file. Users that
do not have these permissions but are able to read log files may be able
to discover a user's password.

This was fixed in [revision 1140072](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1140072).

This was identified by Polina Genova on 14 June 2011 and
made public on 27 June 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.33

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2526)

Tomcat provides support for sendfile with the HTTP APR
connector. sendfile is used automatically for content served via the
DefaultServlet and deployed web applications may use it directly via
setting request attributes. These request attributes were not validated.
When running under a security manager, this lack of validation allowed a
malicious web application to do one or more of the following that would
normally be prevented by a security manager:

* return files to users that the security manager should make
  inaccessible
* terminate (via a crash) the JVM

Additionally, these vulnerabilities only occur when all of the following
are true:

* untrusted web applications are being used
* the SecurityManager is used to limit the untrusted web applications
* the HTTP APR connector is used
* sendfile is enabled for the connector (this is the default)

This was fixed in [revision 1158244](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1158244).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 7 July 2011 and
made public on 13 July 2011.

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2729](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2729)

Due to a bug in the capabilities code, jsvc (the service wrapper for
Linux that is part of the Commons Daemon project) does not drop
capabilities allowing the application to access files and directories
owned by superuser. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* Tomcat is running on a Linux operating system
* jsvc was compiled with libcap
* -user parameter is used

Affected Tomcat versions shipped with source files for jsvc that included
this vulnerability.

This was fixed in [revision 1159346](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1159346).

This was identified by Wilfried Weissmann on 20 July 2011 and made public
on 12 August 2011.

**Important: Authentication bypass and information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3190](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3190)

Apache Tomcat supports the AJP protocol which is used with reverse
proxies to pass requests and associated data about the request from the
reverse proxy to Tomcat. The AJP protocol is designed so that when a
request includes a request body, an unsolicited AJP message is sent to
Tomcat that includes the first part (or possibly all) of the request
body. In certain circumstances, Tomcat did not process this message as a
request body but as a new request. This permitted an attacker to have
full control over the AJP message permitting authentication bypass and
information disclosure. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* The org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler AJP connector is not used
* POST requests are accepted
* The request body is not processed

This was fixed in [revision 1162960](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162960).

This was reported publicly on 20th August 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.33

Mitigation options:

* Upgrade to Tomcat 5.5.34.
* Apply the appropriate [patch](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162960).
* Configure both Tomcat and the reverse proxy to use a shared secret.

  (It is "`request.secret`" attribute in AJP <Connector>,
  "`worker.workername.secret`" directive for mod\_jk.
  The mod\_proxy\_ajp module currently does not support shared secrets).
* Use the org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler (BIO) AJP connector
  implementation.

  (It is automatically selected if you do not have Tomcat-Native library
  installed. It can be also selected explicitly:
  `<Connector protocol="org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler">`).

**Low: SecurityManager file permission bypass**
[CVE-2010-3718](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3718)

When running under a SecurityManager, access to the file system is
limited but web applications are granted read/write permissions to the
work directory. This directory is used for a variety of temporary files
such as the intermediate files generated when compiling JSPs to Servlets.
The location of the work directory is specified by a ServletContect
attribute that is meant to be read-only to web applications. However,
due to a coding error, the read-only setting was not applied. Therefore,
a malicious web application may modify the attribute before Tomcat
applies the file permissions. This can be used to grant read/write
permissions to any area on the file system which a malicious web
application may then take advantage of. This vulnerability is only
applicable when hosting web applications from untrusted sources such as
shared hosting environments.

This was fixed in [revision 1027610](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1027610).

This was discovered by the Tomcat security team on 12 Oct 2010 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service and Information Disclosure
Vulnerability**
[CVE-2010-2227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2227)

Several flaws in the handling of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header were
found that prevented the recycling of a buffer. A remote attacker could
trigger this flaw which would cause subsequent requests to fail and/or
information to leak between requests. This flaw is mitigated if Tomcat is
behind a reverse proxy (such as Apache httpd 2.2) as the proxy should
reject the invalid transfer encoding header.

This was fixed in [revision 959428](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=959428).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 14 Jun 2010 and

**Low: Information disclosure in authentication headers**
[CVE-2010-1157](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1157)

The `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header for BASIC and DIGEST
authentication includes a realm name. If a
`<realm-name>` element is specified for the application
in web.xml it will be used. However, a `<realm-name>`
is not specified then Tomcat will generate realm name using the code
snippet `request.getServerName() + ":" +
request.getServerPort()`. In some circumstances this can expose
the local host name or IP address of the machine running Tomcat.

This was fixed in [revision 936541](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=936541).

[CVE-2009-2693](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2693)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR files were not checked for directory
traversal attempts. This allows an attacker to create arbitrary content
outside of the web root by including entries such as
`../../bin/catalina.sh` in the WAR.

This was fixed in [revision 902650](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=902650).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and

**Low: Insecure partial deploy after failed undeploy**
[CVE-2009-2901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2901)

By default, Tomcat automatically deploys any directories placed in a
host's appBase. This behaviour is controlled by the autoDeploy attribute
of a host which defaults to true. After a failed undeploy, the remaining
files will be deployed as a result of the autodeployment process.
Depending on circumstances, files normally protected by one or more
security constraints may be deployed without those security constraints,
making them accessible without authentication. This issue only affects
Windows platforms

This was fixed in [revision 902650](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=902650).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and

**Low: Unexpected file deletion in work directory**
[CVE-2009-2902](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2902)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR file names were not checked for
directory traversal attempts. For example, deploying and undeploying
`...war` allows an attacker to cause the deletion of the
current contents of the host's work directory which may cause problems
for currently running applications.

This was fixed in [revision 902650](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=902650).

When using a RequestDispatcher obtained from the Request, the target path
was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that
included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access
content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by
locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.

This was fixed in revisions [782757](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=782757) and

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2009-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0033)

If Tomcat receives a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP
connector, it does not return an error and instead closes the AJP
connection. In case this connector is member of a mod\_jk load balancing
worker, this member will be put into an error state and will be blocked
from use for approximately one minute. Thus the behaviour can be used for
a denial of service attack using a carefully crafted request.

This was fixed in [revision 781362](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=781362).

[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450)

The fix for this issue was insufficient. A fix was also required in the
JK connector module for httpd. See [CVE-2007-1860](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1860) for further
information.

Tomcat permits '\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters. When Tomcat is used
behind a proxy (including, but not limited to, Apache HTTP server with
mod\_proxy and mod\_jk) configured to only proxy some contexts, a HTTP request
containing strings like "/\../" may allow attackers to work around the context
restriction of the proxy, and access the non-proxied contexts.

The following Java system properties have been added to Tomcat to provide
additional control of the handling of path delimiters in URLs (both options
default to false):

* `org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH`: `true|false`
* `org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH`: `true|false`

Due to the impossibility to guarantee that all URLs are handled by Tomcat as
they are in proxy servers, Tomcat should always be secured as if no proxy
restricting context access was used.

the Accept-Language header value conforms to RFC 2616. Under normal
circumstances this would not be possible to exploit, however older
versions of Flash player were known to allow carefully crafted malicious
Flash files to make requests with such custom headers. When generating
the response for `getLocale()` and `getLocales()`,
Tomcat now ignores values for Accept-Language headers that do not conform
to RFC 2616. Applications that use the raw header values directly should
not assume that the headers conform to RFC 2616 and should filter the

[CVE-2006-7196](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7196)

The calendar application included as part of the JSP examples is
susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack as it does not escape
user provided data before including it in the returned page.

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.15

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.13, 5.0.SVN

**Low: Directory listing**
[CVE-2006-3835](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3835)

This is expected behaviour when directory listings are enabled. The
semicolon (;) is the separator for path parameters so inserting one
before a file name changes the request into a request for a directory
with a path parameter. If directory listings are enabled, a directory
listing will be shown. In response to this and other directory listing
issues, directory listings were changed to be disabled by default.

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.12

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2005-3510](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3510)

The root cause is the relatively expensive calls required to generate
the content for the directory listings. If directory listings are
enabled, the number of files in each directory should be kept to a
minimum. In response to this issue, directory listings were changed to
be disabled by default. Additionally, a
[patch](http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-dev&m=113356822719767&w=2) has been proposed that would improve performance, particularly
for large directories, by caching directory listings.

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.12

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.7, 5.0.SVN

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2005-4838](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4838)

Various JSPs included as part of the JSP examples and the Tomcat Manager
are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack as they do not escape
user provided data before including it in the returned page.

Affects: 5.0.0-5.0.30, 5.5.0-5.5.6

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat 5.5.1

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-3271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3271)

[Bug 25835](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=25835) can, in rare circumstances - this has only been reproduced
using a debugger to force a particular processing sequence for two threads -
allow a user from a non-permitted IP address to gain access to a context
that is protected with a valve that extends RequestFilterValve. This includes
the standard RemoteAddrValve and RemoteHostValve implementations.

Affects: 5.5.0 (5.0.x unknown)

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2010-4476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4476)

A JVM bug could cause Double conversion to hang JVM when accessing to a
form based security constrained page or any page that calls
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocale() or
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocales(). A specially crafted request
can be used to trigger a denial of service.

A work-around for this JVM bug was provided in
[revision 1066318](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1066318).
This work-around is included in Tomcat 5.5.33 onwards.

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 01 Feb 2011 and
made public on 31 Jan 2011.

Affects: 5.5.0-5.5.32

**Moderate: TLS SSL Man In The Middle**
[CVE-2009-3555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555)

A vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol that allows an attacker to
inject arbitrary requests into an TLS stream during renegotiation.

The TLS implementation used by Tomcat varies with connector. The blocking
IO (BIO) and non-blocking (NIO) connectors use the JSSE implementation
provided by the JVM. The APR/native connector uses OpenSSL.

The BIO connector is vulnerable if the JSSE version used is vulnerable.
To workaround this until a fix is available in JSSE, a new connector
attribute `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation` has been added to
the BIO connector. It should be set to `false` (the default)
to protect against this vulnerability.

The NIO connector is not vulnerable as it does not support
renegotiation.

The APR/native workarounds are detailed on the
[APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

Users should be aware that the impact of disabling renegotiation will
vary with both application and client. In some circumstances disabling
renegotiation may result in some clients being unable to access the
application.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 904851](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=904851)
that provided the new `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation`
attribute. This work around is included in Tomcat 5.5.29 onwards.

Support for the new TLS renegotiation protocol (RFC 5746) that does not
have this security issue:

* For connectors using JSSE implementation provided by JVM:
  Added in Tomcat 5.5.33.

  Requires JRE that supports RFC 5746. For Oracle JRE that is
  [known](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/tlsreadme2-176330.html)
  to be 6u22 or later.
* For connectors using APR and OpenSSL:

  TBD. See
  [APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2008-2938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2938)

Originally reported as a Tomcat vulnerability the root cause of this
issue is that the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to
UTF-8. This exposes a directory traversal vulnerability when the
connector uses `URIEncoding="UTF-8"`. This directory traversal
is limited to the docBase of the web application.

If a context is configured with `allowLinking="true"` then the
directory traversal vulnerability is extended to the entire file system
of the host server.

It should also be noted that setting
`useBodyEncodingForURI="true"` has the same effect as setting
`URIEncoding="UTF-8"` when processing requests with bodies
encoded with UTF-8.

Although the root cause was quickly identified as a JVM issue and that it
affected multiple JVMs from multiple vendors, it was decided to report
this as a Tomcat vulnerability until such time as the JVM vendors
provided updates to resolve this issue. For further information on the
status of this issue for your JVM, contact your JVM vendor.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 681029](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=681029)
that protects against this and any similar character
encoding issues that may still exist in the JVM. This work around is
included in Tomcat 5.5.27 onwards.

**JavaMail information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-1754](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1754)

The vulnerability described is in the web application deployed on Tomcat
rather than in Tomcat.

**JavaMail information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-1753](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1753)

The vulnerability described is in the web application deployed on Tomcat
rather than in Tomcat.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c0)  peter neville    2004-07-06 15:18:51 UTC  ``` I'm trying to use JSTL 1.1 with this version of tomcat and have both saxon and  crimson in my web-app.  If we have crimson and saxon in our webapp lib then tomcat tries to use crimson  as the xml parser when reading the web.xml and compiling the jsp and we get the  prefix error:  org.apache.jasper.JasperException: <h3>Validation error messages from  TagLibraryValidator for c</h3><p>null: java.lang.IllegalStateException: can't  declare any more prefixes in this context</p><h3>Validation error messages from  TagLibraryValidator for fmt</h3><p>null: java.lang.IllegalStateException: can't  declare any more prefixes in this context</p>  If we remove crimson, tomcat uses saxon (aelfred parser) and this fails on  reading the web.xml (javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException: AElfred  parser is namespace-aware)  If we remove saxon and crimson then we are okay (defaults to xerces in the  tomcat endorsed directory?)  It seems to me that tomcat is using the parser in my web-app to read the  web.xml rather than using xerces from the endorsed directory.    The same web-app runs without problems in version 5.0.16.    Tomcat seems to be using the service provider mechanism in 5.0.25 as I have  property files in C:\Java\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.25 \work\Catalina\localhost\diabetes\loader\META-INF\services (can't find any  documents on this).  If I'm using more than one parser won't this cause problems as tomcat is  setting only one parser and xslt processor here?  Any comments are gratefully received.  Thanks, Peter Neville ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c1)  peter neville    2004-07-06 15:21:39 UTC  ``` BTW: Java SDK is version 1.4.2_01 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c2)  Remy Maucherat    2004-07-06 15:52:31 UTC  ``` I am afraid if you want this resolved, you'll have to investigate this further. One thing which really hurts your report is the fact that this would be a classloader issue, and yet there is no relevant functional changes in the classloader since 5.0.16. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c3)  Tim Funk    2004-07-06 16:02:18 UTC  ``` Are you sure you haven't duplicated the tagdef in the JSP multiple times?  For example - this would cause an error: <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %> <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %>  Or this: <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %> <%@include page="foo.jsp"%>   where foo.jsp also has: <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c4)  peter neville    2004-07-07 07:57:06 UTC  ``` Remy: You mention that there hasn;t been any classloader chnages since 5.0.16,  but to the best of my knowledge 5.0.16 did not store service provider details  in the apache work/catalina/localhost/webapp/loader sub-directories. Are there any explanations on this available?  Tim:  The taglibs are declared as:  <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="<http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core>" %> <%@ taglib prefix="fn" uri="<http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions>" %> <%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="<http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt>" %>  So not multiple declarations - there ins aninclude but this doesn't use taglibs.  The problem is instantly resolved by removing saxon and crimson from the web- app lib.   Thanks for your help so far... ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c5)  peter neville    2004-07-07 08:20:53 UTC  ``` Also, I must set my web.xml for the web-app to : <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <web-app xmlns="<http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee>"     xmlns:xsi="<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance>"     xsi:schemaLocation="<http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee> web-app_2_4.xsd"     version="2.4">  instead of :  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"     "<http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd>"> <web-app>   Otherwise tomcat gives errors when compiling the jsp indicating that it can't  find bean properties etc. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c6)  Remy Maucherat    2004-07-07 14:49:47 UTC  ``` If you don't know what 5.0.16 has and what it does not have, I think you need to check the CVS history. I really cannot see anything I'd like to test in this bug report (except the usual: we don't support replacing the XML provider, except using the JVM provided mechanism). ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c7)  Eliot Stock    2004-07-13 17:19:49 UTC  ``` for what it's worth I'm seeing the same thing with:  tomcat 5.0.25 jstl 1.1 j2dsk 1.4.2_05 linux  for a web app that has crimson in the WEB-INF/lib. Removing the JAR that contains crimson fixes it. It's surprising to me that tomcat is using the parser it finds in the web app for web.xml and JSP compilation - not what I'd expect and will probably trip other people up the same way. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c8)  Eddy Chan    2007-06-07 12:15:01 UTC  ``` This issue is also prevalent in 5.5.x.  To reproduce, do the following:  1) Remove all stock webapps that come with the standard installation.  This includes the ones in server/webapps.  Remember to remove the configurations in conf/Catalina. 2) Add a webapp that has a saxon parser located in WEB-INF/lib.  For instance, one from sourceforge. 3) Start Tomcat.

issue here is that when the Digester to parse web.xml is set in ContextConfig, the path to WEB-INF/lib is established for the WebappClassloader.  When the SAXParserFactory is created with newInstance() within the call to Digester.getParser(), the rules dictate that it will search thirdmost for a file META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory in jars available, and it will find it in saxon.jar, prior to defaulting to a platform default parser.  This webapp parser is now used for parsing the web.xml file, but since this task is the container's responsibility, it should not be used.  As a note, this particular parser needs to be namespace-aware and the setting of it being not namespace-aware throws this exception.  A possible solution is to load the (default) parser into the Digester prior to having it being loaded by the WebappClassloader.  Since this appears to be one-time settable, it will use this parser regardless of what the webapp has. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c9)  Ryan Sweet    2007-08-02 11:08:22 UTC  ``` Eddy, which particular sourceforge webapp did you use to test this? ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c10)  Eddy Chan    2007-08-07 14:10:59 UTC  ``` The webapp was one of my own, but you just need a bare one, I believe.  It contained a saxon parser from Sourceforge, which overrides the default parser. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c11)  Mark Thomas    2007-09-03 17:50:13 UTC  ``` This works for me, at least I can't reproduce by following the steps provided here, with the latest source from svn.  Please test this with the latest 5.5.x release. If you still see the issue, please provide the simplest possible WAR that reproduces the issue on a clean Tomcat install along with any additional configuration steps that may be required. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c12)  Eddy Chan    2007-09-26 13:54:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 20889](attachment.cgi?id=20889 "WAR causing problem for container") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=20889&action=edit "WAR causing problem for container") WAR causing problem for container ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c13)  Eddy Chan    2007-09-26 13:56:44 UTC  ``` I've attached a small problematic WAR that just contains a blank web.xml along with a saxon.jar in the WEB-INF/lib.  Remember that you need to remove ALL the apps that come with Tomcat (rm -fr webapps/*) as well as the configs (rm -fr conf/Catalina).  ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c14)  John Kew    2007-10-02 14:52:12 UTC  ``` I can replicate this issue with the provided war on 5.5.x. It seems odd that this only occurs with the conf/Catalina and other webapps missing. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c15)  Mark Thomas    2008-04-20 13:46:01 UTC  ``` The root cause of this issue is the ContextConfig class creating the parser for web.xml whilst it is using the webapp's classloader. This causes a problem if the app being processed includes an xml parser.  I have committed a fix to trunk and will propose it for 6.0.x and 5.5.x. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c16)  Mark Thomas    2008-04-25 12:18:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 43444](show_bug.cgi?id=43444 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Class loading problem") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c17)  Mark Thomas    2008-05-01 10:43:29 UTC  ``` This has been committed to 6.0.x and will be in 6.0.17 onwards. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c18)  Mark Thomas    2008-07-30 11:06:36 UTC  ``` This has been fixed in 5.5.x and will be included in 5.5.27 onwards. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

### Apache Tomcat 4.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 4.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 4.0.x and 4.1.x are no longer supported.
Further vulnerabilities in the 4.0.x and 4.1.x branches will not be
fixed. Users should upgrade to 8.5.x or later to obtain security fixes.**

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the
[Tomcat Security Team](security.html).

allowLinking="true". Failure to reject the null byte enables an attacker
to obtain the source for any JSP page in these contexts. Users of Tomcat
4.1.x are advised to use the default, supported Coyote HTTP/1.1 connector
which does not exhibit this issue. There are no plans to issue an update
to Tomcat 4.1.x for this issue.

[CVE-2008-5515](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5515)

When using a RequestDispatcher obtained from the Request, the target path
was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that
included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access
content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by
locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.

This was fixed in revisions [782763](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=782763) and
[783292](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=783292).

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2009-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0033)

If Tomcat receives a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP
connector, it does not return an error and instead closes the AJP
connection. In case this connector is member of a mod\_jk load balancing
worker, this member will be put into an error state and will be blocked
from use for approximately one minute. Thus the behaviour can be used for
a denial of service attack using a carefully crafted request.

This was fixed in [revision 781362](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=781362).

Affects: 4.1.0-4.1.39

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2009-0580](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0580)

Due to insufficient error checking in some authentication classes, Tomcat
allows for the enumeration (brute force testing) of user names by
supplying illegally URL encoded passwords. The attack is possible if FORM
based authentication (j\_security\_check) is used with the MemoryRealm.
Note that in early versions, the DataSourceRealm and JDBCRealm were also
affected.

This was fixed in [revision 781382](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=781382).

The message argument of HttpServletResponse.sendError() call is not only
displayed on the error page, but is also used for the reason-phrase of
HTTP response. This may include characters that are illegal in HTTP

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2005-2090](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2090)

Requests with multiple content-length headers should be rejected as
invalid. When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat)
process a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain
multiple content-length headers and several components do not
reject the request and make different decisions as to which
content-length header to use an attacker can poison a web-cache, perform
an XSS attack and obtain sensitive information from requests other then
their own. Tomcat now returns 400 for requests with multiple
content-length headers.

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450)

The fix for this issue was insufficient. A fix was also required in the
JK connector module for httpd. See
[CVE-2007-1860](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1860) for further information.

Tomcat permits '\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters. When Tomcat is
used behind a proxy (including, but not limited to, Apache HTTP server
with mod\_proxy and mod\_jk) configured to only proxy some contexts, a HTTP
request containing strings like "/\../" may allow attackers to work
around the context restriction of the proxy, and access the non-proxied
contexts.

The following Java system properties have been added to Tomcat to provide
additional control of the handling of path delimiters in URLs (both
options default to false):

* `org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH`:
  `true|false`
* `org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH`:
  `true|false`

Due to the impossibility to guarantee that all URLs are handled by Tomcat
as they are in proxy servers, Tomcat should always be secured as if no
proxy restricting context access was used.

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2007-1358](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1358)

Web pages that display the Accept-Language header value sent by the
client are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack if they assume
the Accept-Language header value conforms to RFC 2616. Under normal
circumstances this would not be possible to exploit, however older
versions of Flash player were known to allow carefully crafted malicious
Flash files to make requests with such custom headers. When generating
the response for `getLocale()` and `getLocales()`,
Tomcat now ignores values for Accept-Language headers that do not conform
to RFC 2616. Applications that use the raw header values directly should
not assume that the headers conform to RFC 2616 and should filter the
values appropriately.

This is expected behaviour when directory listings are enabled. The
semicolon (;) is the separator for path parameters so inserting one

enabled, the number of files in each directory should be kepp to a
minimum. In response to this issue, directory listings were changed to
be disabled by default. Additionally, a
[patch](http://marc.info/?l=tomcat-dev&m=113356822719767&w=2) has been proposed that would improve performance, particularly
for large directories, by caching directory listings.

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2008-2938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2938)

Originally reported as a Tomcat vulnerability the root cause of this
issue is that the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to
UTF-8. This exposes a directory traversal vulnerability when the
connector uses `URIEncoding="UTF-8"`. This directory traversal
is limited to the docBase of the web application.

If a context is configured with `allowLinking="true"` then the
directory traversal vulnerability is extended to the entire file system
of the host server.

It should also be noted that setting
`useBodyEncodingForURI="true"` has the same effect as setting
`URIEncoding="UTF-8"` when processing requests with bodies
encoded with UTF-8.

Although the root cause was quickly identified as a JVM issue and that it
affected multiple JVMs from multiple vendors, it was decided to report
this as a Tomcat vulnerability until such time as the JVM vendors
provided updates to resolve this issue. For further information on the
status of this issue for your JVM, contact your JVM vendor.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 681065](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=681065)
that protects against this and any similar character
encoding issues that may still exist in the JVM. This work around is
included in Tomcat 4.1.39 onwards.

**Denial of service vulnerability**
[CVE-2002-0936](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0936)

The issue described requires an attacker to be able to plant a JSP page
on the Tomcat server. If an attacker can do this then the server is
already compromised. In this case an attacker could just as easily add a
page that called System.exit(1) rather than relying on a bug in an
internal Sun class.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c0)  Eddy Chan    2008-10-01 23:51:18 UTC  ``` Along the same lines with CR 29936, com.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig.tldDigester has an issue with initialization.  Basically, the TldConfig's parser can be initialized with the webapp's XML parser, which causes a security problem, since it has permission issues with reading files.  This is caused by a similar scenario to CR 29936:  1) Remove all stock webapps that come with the standard installation.  This includes the ones in server/webapps.  Remember to remove the configurations in conf/Catalina. 2) Add a webapp that has a XML parser located in WEB-INF/lib.  For instance, one from sourceforge or Apache Xerces. 3) Add a library containing a .tld file in META-INF like Spring. 4) In order to actually have a log containing the error, you need to enable logging.  For example, by following the instructions laid out in <http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/logging.html>.  I used log4j. 5) Start the appserver in secure mode.  You should see an error in the log similar to the following:  ERROR main org.apache.catalina.startup.TldConfig - Exception processing TLD META-INF/spring-form.tld in JAR at resource path TOMCAT_PATH/webapps/MY_WAR/WEB-INF/lib/spring.jar in context /MY_WAR java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission TOMCAT_PATH/common/lib/jsp-api.jar read)         at

Looking at your stack trace the security exception is caused when trying to read jsp-api.jar. This jar should never be scanned as it is on the exclude list so I don't understand how you can be seeing this error.  Reviewing the code does show that there is an issue. Additionally, the XML validation settings of the first context precessed are used for all contexts. I can fix these issues based purely on code review but it would be nice to be able to confirm the fix with a test case. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=45933#c3)  Mark Thomas    2008-10-03 04:54:19 UTC  ``` Ignore my previous.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c0)  peter neville    2004-07-06 15:18:51 UTC  ``` I'm trying to use JSTL 1.1 with this version of tomcat and have both saxon and  crimson in my web-app.  If we have crimson and saxon in our webapp lib then tomcat tries to use crimson  as the xml parser when reading the web.xml and compiling the jsp and we get the  prefix error:  org.apache.jasper.JasperException: <h3>Validation error messages from  TagLibraryValidator for c</h3><p>null: java.lang.IllegalStateException: can't  declare any more prefixes in this context</p><h3>Validation error messages from  TagLibraryValidator for fmt</h3><p>null: java.lang.IllegalStateException: can't  declare any more prefixes in this context</p>  If we remove crimson, tomcat uses saxon (aelfred parser) and this fails on  reading the web.xml (javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException: AElfred  parser is namespace-aware)  If we remove saxon and crimson then we are okay (defaults to xerces in the  tomcat endorsed directory?)  It seems to me that tomcat is using the parser in my web-app to read the  web.xml rather than using xerces from the endorsed directory.    The same web-app runs without problems in version 5.0.16.    Tomcat seems to be using the service provider mechanism in 5.0.25 as I have  property files in C:\Java\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.25 \work\Catalina\localhost\diabetes\loader\META-INF\services (can't find any  documents on this).  If I'm using more than one parser won't this cause problems as tomcat is  setting only one parser and xslt processor here?  Any comments are gratefully received.  Thanks, Peter Neville ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c1)  peter neville    2004-07-06 15:21:39 UTC  ``` BTW: Java SDK is version 1.4.2_01 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c2)  Remy Maucherat    2004-07-06 15:52:31 UTC  ``` I am afraid if you want this resolved, you'll have to investigate this further. One thing which really hurts your report is the fact that this would be a classloader issue, and yet there is no relevant functional changes in the classloader since 5.0.16. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c3)  Tim Funk    2004-07-06 16:02:18 UTC  ``` Are you sure you haven't duplicated the tagdef in the JSP multiple times?  For example - this would cause an error: <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %> <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %>  Or this: <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %> <%@include page="foo.jsp"%>   where foo.jsp also has: <%@ taglib uri="<http://java.sun.com/jstl/core/c.tld>" prefix="c" %> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c4)  peter neville    2004-07-07 07:57:06 UTC  ``` Remy: You mention that there hasn;t been any classloader chnages since 5.0.16,  but to the best of my knowledge 5.0.16 did not store service provider details  in the apache work/catalina/localhost/webapp/loader sub-directories. Are there any explanations on this available?  Tim:  The taglibs are declared as:  <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="<http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core>" %> <%@ taglib prefix="fn" uri="<http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions>" %> <%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="<http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt>" %>  So not multiple declarations - there ins aninclude but this doesn't use taglibs.  The problem is instantly resolved by removing saxon and crimson from the web- app lib.   Thanks for your help so far... ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c5)  peter neville    2004-07-07 08:20:53 UTC  ``` Also, I must set my web.xml for the web-app to : <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <web-app xmlns="<http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee>"     xmlns:xsi="<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance>"     xsi:schemaLocation="<http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee> web-app_2_4.xsd"     version="2.4">  instead of :  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"     "<http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd>"> <web-app>   Otherwise tomcat gives errors when compiling the jsp indicating that it can't  find bean properties etc. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c6)  Remy Maucherat    2004-07-07 14:49:47 UTC  ``` If you don't know what 5.0.16 has and what it does not have, I think you need to check the CVS history. I really cannot see anything I'd like to test in this bug report (except the usual: we don't support replacing the XML provider, except using the JVM provided mechanism). ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c7)  Eliot Stock    2004-07-13 17:19:49 UTC  ``` for what it's worth I'm seeing the same thing with:  tomcat 5.0.25 jstl 1.1 j2dsk 1.4.2_05 linux  for a web app that has crimson in the WEB-INF/lib. Removing the JAR that contains crimson fixes it. It's surprising to me that tomcat is using the parser it finds in the web app for web.xml and JSP compilation - not what I'd expect and will probably trip other people up the same way. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c8)  Eddy Chan    2007-06-07 12:15:01 UTC  ``` This issue is also prevalent in 5.5.x.  To reproduce, do the following:  1) Remove all stock webapps that come with the standard installation.  This includes the ones in server/webapps.  Remember to remove the configurations in conf/Catalina. 2) Add a webapp that has a saxon parser located in WEB-INF/lib.  For instance, one from sourceforge. 3) Start Tomcat.

issue here is that when the Digester to parse web.xml is set in ContextConfig, the path to WEB-INF/lib is established for the WebappClassloader.  When the SAXParserFactory is created with newInstance() within the call to Digester.getParser(), the rules dictate that it will search thirdmost for a file META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory in jars available, and it will find it in saxon.jar, prior to defaulting to a platform default parser.  This webapp parser is now used for parsing the web.xml file, but since this task is the container's responsibility, it should not be used.  As a note, this particular parser needs to be namespace-aware and the setting of it being not namespace-aware throws this exception.  A possible solution is to load the (default) parser into the Digester prior to having it being loaded by the WebappClassloader.  Since this appears to be one-time settable, it will use this parser regardless of what the webapp has. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c9)  Ryan Sweet    2007-08-02 11:08:22 UTC  ``` Eddy, which particular sourceforge webapp did you use to test this? ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c10)  Eddy Chan    2007-08-07 14:10:59 UTC  ``` The webapp was one of my own, but you just need a bare one, I believe.  It contained a saxon parser from Sourceforge, which overrides the default parser. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c11)  Mark Thomas    2007-09-03 17:50:13 UTC  ``` This works for me, at least I can't reproduce by following the steps provided here, with the latest source from svn.

If you still see the issue, please provide the simplest possible WAR that reproduces the issue on a clean Tomcat install along with any additional configuration steps that may be required. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c12)  Eddy Chan    2007-09-26 13:54:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 20889](attachment.cgi?id=20889 "WAR causing problem for container") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=20889&action=edit "WAR causing problem for container") WAR causing problem for container ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c13)  Eddy Chan    2007-09-26 13:56:44 UTC  ``` I've attached a small problematic WAR that just contains a blank web.xml along with a saxon.jar in the WEB-INF/lib.

It seems odd that this only occurs with the conf/Catalina and other webapps missing. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c15)  Mark Thomas    2008-04-20 13:46:01 UTC  ``` The root cause of this issue is the ContextConfig class creating the parser for web.xml whilst it is using the webapp's classloader. This causes a problem if the app being processed includes an xml parser.  I have committed a fix to trunk and will propose it for 6.0.x and 5.5.x. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c16)  Mark Thomas    2008-04-25 12:18:14 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 43444](show_bug.cgi?id=43444 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Class loading problem") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c17)  Mark Thomas    2008-05-01 10:43:29 UTC  ``` This has been committed to 6.0.x and will be in 6.0.17 onwards. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=29936#c18)  Mark Thomas    2008-07-30 11:06:36 UTC  ``` This has been fixed in 5.5.x and will be included in 5.5.27 onwards. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. Service Console update for ntp

Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5\_3.2
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
security issues.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
command.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in the Service Console (column 4) if a solution is available.

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

#####

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

### Apache Tomcat 6.x vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat® 6.x. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat the flaw
is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the
version with a question mark.

**Note:** Vulnerabilities that are not Tomcat vulnerabilities
but have either been incorrectly reported against Tomcat or where Tomcat
provides a workaround are listed at the end of this page.

**Please note that Tomcat 6.0.x has reached
[end of life](tomcat-60-eol.html) and is no longer supported.
Further vulnerabilities in the 6.0.x branch will not be fixed. Users
should upgrade to 8.5.x or later to obtain security fixes.**

Please note that binary patches are never provided. If you need to
apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the
Apache Tomcat version that you are using. For Tomcat 6.0 those are
[`building.html`](/tomcat-6.0-doc/building.html) and
[`BUILDING.txt`](/tomcat-6.0-doc/BUILDING.txt).
Both files can be found in the `webapps/docs` subdirectory
of a binary distributive.

If you need help on building or configuring Tomcat or other help on
following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed
here, please send your questions to the public
[Tomcat Users mailing list](lists.html)

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other
unexpected behaviour that has [security
impact](security-impact.html), or if the descriptions here are incomplete,
please report them privately to the
[Tomcat Security Team](security.html). Thank you.

### 7 April 2017 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.53

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2017-5647](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5647)

A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was used
resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file processing of
the previous request completed. This could result in responses appearing
to be sent for the wrong request. For example, a user agent that sent
requests A, B and C could see the correct response for request A, the
response for request C for request B and no response for request C.

This was fixed in revisions [1789024](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1789024),
[1789155](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1789155)
and [1789856](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1789856).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 20
March 2017 and made public on 10 April 2017.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.52

### not yet released Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.50

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.49 but the
release vote for the 6.0.49 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.50 to obtain a version that includes
the fix for this issue, version 6.0.49 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-8745](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8745)

A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP
connector resulted in the current Processor object being added to the
Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same
Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can
result in information leakage between requests including, but not limited
to, session ID and the response body.

This was fixed in revision [1777472](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1777472).

This issue was identified as affecting 6.0.x by the Apache Tomcat Security
Team on 3 January 2016 and made public on 5 January 2017.

Affects: 6.0.16 to 6.0.48

### 15 November 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.48

**Important: Remote Code Execution**
[CVE-2016-8735](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8735)

The `JmxRemoteLifecycleListener` was not updated to take
account of Oracle's fix for [CVE-2016-3427](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3427). Therefore, Tomcat
installations using this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote
code execution vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important
rather than critical due to the small number of installations using this
listener and that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be
accessible to an attacker even when the listener is used.

This was fixed in revision [1767684](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767684).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 19 October
2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.47

**Important: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6816](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6816)

The code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters.
This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted
the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject
data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the
attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain
sensitive information from requests other then their own.

This was fixed in revision [1767683](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1767683).

This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 11
October 2016 and made public on 22 November 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.47

### 16 October 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.47

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.46 but the
release vote for the 6.0.46 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.47 to obtain a version that includes
fixes for these issues, version 6.0.46 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Unrestricted Access to Global Resources**
[CVE-2016-6797](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6797)

The ResourceLinkFactory did not limit web application access to global
JNDI resources to those resources explicitly linked to the web
application. Therefore, it was possible for a web application to access
any global JNDI resource whether an explicit ResourceLink had been
configured or not.

This was fixed in revision [1757285](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1757285).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 18
January 2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: Security Manager Bypass**
[CVE-2016-6796](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6796)

A malicious web application was able to bypass a configured
SecurityManager via manipulation of the configuration parameters for the
JSP Servlet.

This was fixed in revisions [1758496](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758496) and
[1763237](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1763237).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 27
December 2015 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: System Property Disclosure**
[CVE-2016-6794](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6794)

When a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to read
system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager. Tomcat's
system property replacement feature for configuration files could be used
by a malicious web application to bypass the SecurityManager and read
system properties that should not be visible.

This was fixed in revision [1754733](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754733).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 27
December 2015 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: Security Manager Bypass**
[CVE-2016-5018](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-5018)

A malicious web application was able to bypass a configured
SecurityManager via a Tomcat utility method that was accessible to web
applications.

This was fixed in revisions [1754904](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1754904) and
[1761718](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1761718).

This issue was discovered by Alvaro Munoz and Alexander Mirosh of the HP
Enterprise Security Team and reported to the Apache Tomcat Security Team
on 5 July 2016. It was made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

**Low: Timing Attack**
[CVE-2016-0762](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0762)

The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the
supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to
determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes
the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability
harder.

This was fixed in revision [1758506](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1758506).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team on 1 January
2016 and made public on 27 October 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.45

### 11 February 2016 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.45

**Low: Limited directory traversal**
[CVE-2015-5174](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5174)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

When accessing resources via the `ServletContext` methods
`getResource()` `getResourceAsStream()` and
`getResourcePaths()` the paths should be limited to the
current web application. The validation was not correct and paths of the
form `"/.."` were not rejected. Note that paths starting with
`"/../"` were correctly rejected. This bug allowed malicious
web applications running under a security manager to obtain a directory
listing for the directory in which the web application had been deployed.
This should not be possible when running under a security manager.
Typically, the directory listing that would be exposed would be for
`$CATALINA_BASE/webapps.`

This was fixed in revision [1700900](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1700900).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 August 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

**Low: Directory disclosure**
[CVE-2015-5345](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5345)

When accessing a directory protected by a security constraint with a URL
that did not end in a slash, Tomcat would redirect to the URL with the
trailing slash thereby confirming the presence of the directory before
processing the security constraint. It was therefore possible for a user
to determine if a directory existed or not, even if the user was not
permitted to view the directory. The issue also occurred at the root of a
web application in which case the presence of the web application was
confirmed, even if a user did not have access.

The solution was to implement the redirect in the DefaultServlet so that
any security constraints and/or security enforcing Filters were processed
before the redirect. The Tomcat team recognised that moving the redirect
could cause regressions so two new Context configuration options
(`mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled` and
`mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled`) were introduced. The initial
default was `false` for both since this was more secure.
However, due to regressions such as
[Bug
58765](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58765) the default for `mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled`
was later changed to true since it was viewed that the regression was
more serious than the security risk of associated with being able to
determine if a web application was deployed at a given path.

This was fixed in revisions [1715216](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1715216) and
[1717216](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1717216).

This issue was identified by Mark Koek of QCSec on 12 October 2015 and
made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

**Low: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0706](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0706)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

The internal StatusManagerServlet could be loaded by a malicious web
application when a security manager was configured. This servlet could
then provide the malicious web application with a list of all deployed
applications and a list of the HTTP request lines for all requests
currently being processed. This could have exposed sensitive information
from other web applications, such as session IDs, to the web
application.

This was fixed in revision [1722802](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1722802).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 December 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2016-0714](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0714)

This issue only affects users running untrusted web applications under a
security manager.

Tomcat provides several session persistence mechanisms. The
`StandardManager` persists session over a restart. The
`PersistentManager` is able to persist sessions to files, a
database or a custom `Store`. The cluster implementation
persists sessions to one or more additional nodes in the cluster. All of
these mechanisms could be exploited to bypass a security manager. Session
persistence is performed by Tomcat code with the permissions assigned to
Tomcat internal code. By placing a carefully crafted object into a
session, a malicious web application could trigger the execution of
arbitrary code.

This was fixed in revisions [1727166](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1727166) and
[1727182](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1727182).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 November 2015
and made public on 22 February 2016.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.44

### 12 May 2015 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.44

**Low: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0230](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0230)

When a response for a request with a request body is returned to the user
agent before the request body is fully read, by default Tomcat swallows the
remaining request body so that the next request on the connection may be
processed. There was no limit to the size of request body that Tomcat would
swallow. This permitted a limited Denial of Service as Tomcat would never
close the connection and a processing thread would remain allocated to the
connection.

This was fixed in revision [1659537](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1659537).

This issue was disclosed to the Tomcat security team by AntBean@secdig
from the Baidu Security Team on 4 June 2014 and made public on 9 April
2015.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.43

**Moderate: Security Manager bypass**
[CVE-2014-7810](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7810)

Malicious web applications could use expression language to bypass the
protections of a Security Manager as expressions were evaluated within a
privileged code section.

This was fixed in revisions [1645366](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1645366) and
[1659538](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1659538).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 2 November 2014
and made public on 14 May 2015.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.43

### 22 November 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.43

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.42 but the
release vote for the 6.0.42 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 6.0.43 to obtain a version that
includes a fix for this issue, version 6.0.42 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Request Smuggling**
[CVE-2014-0227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0227)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk as part of a chunked request
that caused Tomcat to read part of the request body as a new request.

This was fixed in revision [1603628](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1603628).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 30 May 2014
and made public on 9 February 2015.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.41

### released 23 May 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.41

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.40 but the
release vote for the 6.0.40 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 6.0.41 to obtain a version that
includes fixes for these issues, version 6.0.40 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2014-0075](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0075)

It was possible to craft a malformed chunk size as part of a chucked
request that enabled an unlimited amount of data to be streamed to the
server, bypassing the various size limits enforced on a request. This
enabled a denial of service attack.

This was fixed in revision [1579262](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1579262).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat security team by David Jorm of the
Red Hat Security Response Team on 28 February 2014 and made public on 27
May 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.39

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0096)

The default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple
levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running
under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the
same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web
application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the security
manager via the use of external XML entities.

This was fixed in revision [1585853](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1585853).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 February 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.39

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0099](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0099)

The code used to parse the request content length header did not check
for overflow in the result. This exposed a request smuggling
vulnerability when Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that
correctly processed the content length header.

This was fixed in revision [1580473](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1580473).

A test case that demonstrated the parsing bug was sent to the Tomcat
security team on 13 March 2014 but no context was provided. The security
implications were identified by the Tomcat security team the day the
report was received and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.39

**Low: Information Disclosure**
[CVE-2014-0119](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0119)

In limited circumstances it was possible for a malicious web application
to replace the XML parsers used by Tomcat to process XSLTs for the
default servlet, JSP documents, tag library descriptors (TLDs) and tag
plugin configuration files. The injected XML parser(s) could then bypass
the limits imposed on XML external entities and/or have visibility of the
XML files processed for other web applications deployed on the same
Tomcat instance.

This was fixed in revisions [1589640](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1589640),
[1593815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1593815) and
[1593821](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1593821).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 April 2014
and made public on 27 May 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.39

### released 31 Jan 2014 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.39

*Note: The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.38 but the
release vote for 6.0.38 did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 6.0.39 to obtain a version
that includes the fixes for these issues, version 6.0.38 is not
included in the list of affected versions.*

**Low: Frame injection in documentation Javadoc**
[CVE-2013-1571](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1571)

Tomcat 6 is built with Java 5 which is known to generate Javadoc with a
frame injection vulnerability.

The published Javadoc on the Apache Tomcat website was fixed the day
this issue was announced. The Javadoc generation for releases was fixed
in revision [1557724](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1557724).

This issue was published by Oracle on 18 June 2013.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.37

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4286](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4286)

The fix for CVE-2005-2090 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* content-length header with chunked encoding over any HTTP connector
* multiple content-length headers over any AJP connector

Requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used should be rejected as invalid.
When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat) process
a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain either multiple
content-length headers or a content-length header when chunked encoding
is being used and several components do not reject the request and make
different decisions as to which content-length header to use an attacker
can poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and obtain sensitive
information from requests other then their own. Tomcat now rejects
requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used.

This was fixed in revision [1552565](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1552565).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 15 August
2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.37

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2013-4322](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4322)

The fix for CVE-2012-3544 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:

* chunk extensions were not limited
* whitespace after the : in a trailing header was not limited

This was fixed in revision [1556540](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1556540).

The first part of this issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security
team on 27 August 2013 and the second part by Saran Neti of TELUS
Security Labs on 5 November 2013. It was made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.37

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2013-4590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4590)

Application provided XML files such as web.xml, context.xml, \*.tld,
\*.tagx and \*.jspx allowed XXE which could be used to expose Tomcat
internals to an attacker. This vulnerability only occurs when Tomcat is
running web applications from untrusted sources such as in a shared
hosting environment.

This was fixed in revision [1558828](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1558828).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 29
October 2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.0 to 6.0.37

**Low: Session fixation**
[CVE-2014-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0033)

Previous fixes to path parameter handling
([1149220](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1149220)) introduced a regression that
meant session IDs provided in the URL were considered even when
disableURLRewriting was configured to true. Note that the session is only
used for that single request.

This was fixed in revision [1558822](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1558822).

This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat security team on 1
December 2013 and made public on 25 February 2014.

Affects: 6.0.33 to 6.0.37

### released 3 May 2013 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.37

**Important: Session fixation**
[CVE-2013-2067](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-2067)

FORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring
authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request
for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login
form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using
the victim's credentials.

Note that the option to change session ID on authentication was added in
Tomcat 6.0.21. In earlier 6.0.x releases, prevention of session fixation
was an application responsibility. This vulnerability represents a bug in
Tomcat's session fixation protection that was added in 6.0.21.
Hence, only versions 6.0.21 onwards are listed as vulnerable.

This was fixed in revision [1417891](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1417891).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 15 Oct 2012 and
made public on 10 May 2013.

Affects: 6.0.21-6.0.36

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-3544](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3544)

When processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding,
Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This
allows a client to perform a limited DOS by streaming an unlimited
amount of data to the server.

This was fixed in revision [1476592](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1476592).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat security team on 10 November 2011
and made public on 10 May 2013.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.36

### released 19 Oct 2012 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.36

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-2733](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2733)

The checks that limited the permitted size of request headers were
implemented too late in the request parsing process for the HTTP NIO
connector. This enabled a malicious user to trigger an
OutOfMemoryError by sending a single request with very large headers.

This was fixed in revision [1356208](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1356208).

This was reported by Josh Spiewak to the Tomcat security team on 4 June
2012 and made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

**Moderate: DIGEST authentication weakness**
[CVE-2012-3439](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3439)

Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication
were identified and resolved:

1. Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count.
2. When a session ID was present, authentication was bypassed.
3. The user name and password were not checked before when indicating
   that a nonce was stale.

These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making
replay attacks possible in some circumstances.

This was fixed in revision [1380829](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1380829).

The first issue was reported by Tilmann Kuhn to the Tomcat security team
on 19 July 2012. The second and third issues were discovered by the
Tomcat security team during the resulting code review. All three issues
were made public on 5 November 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

**Important: Bypass of security constraints**
[CVE-2012-3546](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3546)

When using FORM authentication it was possible to bypass the security
constraint checks in the FORM authenticator by appending
`/j_security_check` to the end of the URL if some other
component (such as the Single-Sign-On valve) had called
`request.setUserPrincipal()` before the call to
`FormAuthenticator#authenticate()`.

This was fixed in revision [1381035](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1381035).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 13 July 2012 and
made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

**Important: Bypass of CSRF prevention filter**
[CVE-2012-4431](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4431)

The CSRF prevention filter could be bypassed if a request was made to a
protected resource without a session identifier present in the request.

This was fixed in revision [1394456](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1394456).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on 8 September 2012
and made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 6.0.30-6.0.35

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-4534](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4534)

When using the NIO connector with sendfile and HTTPS enabled, if a client
breaks the connection while reading the response an infinite loop is
entered leading to a denial of service. This was originally reported as
[bug
52858](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52858).

This was fixed in revision [1372035](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1372035).

The security implications of this bug were reported to the Tomcat
security team by Arun Neelicattu of the Red Hat Security Response Team on
3 October 2012 and made public on 4 December 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.35

### released 5 Dec 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.35

**Note:** *The issues below were fixed in Apache Tomcat
6.0.34 but the release vote for the 6.0.34 release candidate did not
pass. Therefore, although users must download 6.0.35 to obtain a version
that includes a fix for this issue, version 6.0.34 is not included in the
list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3375](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3375)

For performance reasons, information parsed from a request is often
cached in two places: the internal request object and the internal
processor object. These objects are not recycled at exactly the same
time. When certain errors occur that needed to be added to the access
log, the access logging process triggers the re-population of the request
object after it has been recycled. However, the request object was not
recycled before being used for the next request. That lead to information
leakage (e.g. remote IP address, HTTP headers) from the previous request
to the next request. The issue was resolved be ensuring that the request
and response objects were recycled after being re-populated to generate
the necessary access log entries.

This was fixed in [revision 1185998](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1185998).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 22 September 2011 and
made public on 17 January 2012.

Affects: 6.0.30-6.0.33

**Important: Authentication bypass and information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-3190](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3190)

Apache Tomcat supports the AJP protocol which is used with reverse
proxies to pass requests and associated data about the request from the
reverse proxy to Tomcat. The AJP protocol is designed so that when a
request includes a request body, an unsolicited AJP message is sent to
Tomcat that includes the first part (or possibly all) of the request
body. In certain circumstances, Tomcat did not process this message as a
request body but as a new request. This permitted an attacker to have
full control over the AJP message permitting authentication bypass and
information disclosure. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* The org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler AJP connector is not used
* POST requests are accepted
* The request body is not processed

This was fixed in [revision 1162959](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162959).

This was reported publicly on 20th August 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.33

Mitigation options:

* Upgrade to Tomcat 6.0.35.
* Apply the appropriate [patch](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1162959).
* Configure both Tomcat and the reverse proxy to use a shared secret.

  (It is "`request.secret`" attribute in AJP <Connector>,
  "`worker.workername.secret`" directive for mod\_jk.
  The mod\_proxy\_ajp module currently does not support shared secrets).
* Use the org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler (BIO) AJP connector
  implementation.

  (It is automatically selected if you do not have Tomcat-Native library
  installed. It can be also selected explicitly:
  `<Connector protocol="org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler">`).

**Important: Denial of service**
[CVE-2012-0022](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0022)

Analysis of the recent hash collision vulnerability identified unrelated
inefficiencies with Apache Tomcat's handling of large numbers of
parameters and parameter values. These inefficiencies could allow an
attacker, via a specially crafted request, to cause large amounts of CPU
to be used which in turn could create a denial of service. The issue was
addressed by modifying the Tomcat parameter handling code to efficiently
process large numbers of parameters and parameter values.

This was fixed in revisions [1200601](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1200601),
[1206324](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1206324) and
[1229027](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1229027).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 21 October 2011 and
made public on 17 January 2012.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.33

### released 18 Aug 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.33

**Moderate: Multiple weaknesses in HTTP DIGEST authentication**
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184)

Note: Mitre elected to break this issue down into multiple issues and
have allocated the following additional references to parts of this
issue:
[CVE-2011-5062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5062),
[CVE-2011-5063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5063) and
[CVE-2011-5064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5064). The Apache Tomcat security team will
continue to treat this as a single issue using the reference
[CVE-2011-1184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-1184).

The implementation of HTTP DIGEST authentication was discovered to have
several weaknesses:

* replay attacks were permitted
* server nonces were not checked
* client nonce counts were not checked
* qop values were not checked
* realm values were not checked
* the server secret was hard-coded to a known string

The result of these weaknesses is that DIGEST authentication was only as
secure as BASIC authentication.

This was fixed in [revision 1158180](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1158180).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 16 March 2011 and
made public on 26 September 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.32

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2204](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2204)

When using the MemoryUserDatabase (based on tomcat-users.xml) and
creating users via JMX, an exception during the user creation process may
trigger an error message in the JMX client that includes the user's
password. This error message is also written to the Tomcat logs. User
passwords are visible to administrators with JMX access and/or
administrators with read access to the tomcat-users.xml file. Users that
do not have these permissions but are able to read log files may be able
to discover a user's password.

This was fixed in [revision 1140071](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1140071).

This was identified by Polina Genova on 14 June 2011 and
made public on 27 June 2011.

**Low: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2526)

Tomcat provides support for sendfile with the HTTP NIO and HTTP APR
connectors. sendfile is used automatically for content served via the
DefaultServlet and deployed web applications may use it directly via
setting request attributes. These request attributes were not validated.
When running under a security manager, this lack of validation allowed a
malicious web application to do one or more of the following that would
normally be prevented by a security manager:

* return files to users that the security manager should make
  inaccessible
* terminate (via a crash) the JVM

Additionally, these vulnerabilities only occur when all of the following
are true:

* untrusted web applications are being used
* the SecurityManager is used to limit the untrusted web applications
* the HTTP NIO or HTTP APR connector is used
* sendfile is enabled for the connector (this is the default)

This was fixed in [revision 1146703](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1146703).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 7 July 2011 and
made public on 13 July 2011.

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2011-2729](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2729)

Due to a bug in the capabilities code, jsvc (the service wrapper for
Linux that is part of the Commons Daemon project) does not drop
capabilities allowing the application to access files and directories
owned by superuser. This vulnerability only occurs when all of the
following are true:

* Tomcat is running on a Linux operating system
* jsvc was compiled with libcap
* -user parameter is used

Affected Tomcat versions shipped with source files for jsvc that included
this vulnerability.

This was fixed in [revision 1153824](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1153824).

This was identified by Wilfried Weissmann on 20 July 2011 and made public
on 12 August 2011.

Affects: 6.0.30-6.0.32

### released 03 Feb 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.32

**Note:** *The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.31 but the
release vote for the 6.0.31 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.32 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 6.0.31 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2011-0534](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0534)

The NIO connector expands its buffer endlessly during request line
processing. That behaviour can be used for a denial of service attack
using a carefully crafted request.

This was fixed in [revision 1066313](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1066313).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 27 Jan 2011 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.30

### released 13 Jan 2011 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.30

**Low: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2011-0013](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0013)

The HTML Manager interface displayed web application provided data, such
as display names, without filtering. A malicious web application could
trigger script execution by an administrative user when viewing the
manager pages.

This was fixed in [revision 1057270](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1057270).

This was identified by the Tomcat security team on 12 Nov 2010 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

**Moderate: Cross-site scripting**
[CVE-2010-4172](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4172)

The Manager application used the user provided parameters sort and
orderBy directly without filtering thereby permitting cross-site
scripting.

This was fixed in [revision 1037779](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1037779).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 15 Nov 2010 and
made public on 22 Nov 2010.

Affects: 6.0.12-6.0.29

**Low: SecurityManager file permission bypass**
[CVE-2010-3718](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3718)

When running under a SecurityManager, access to the file system is
limited but web applications are granted read/write permissions to the
work directory. This directory is used for a variety of temporary files
such as the intermediate files generated when compiling JSPs to Servlets.
The location of the work directory is specified by a ServletContect
attribute that is meant to be read-only to web applications. However,
due to a coding error, the read-only setting was not applied. Therefore,
a malicious web application may modify the attribute before Tomcat
applies the file permissions. This can be used to grant read/write
permissions to any area on the file system which a malicious web
application may then take advantage of. This vulnerability is only
applicable when hosting web applications from untrusted sources such as
shared hosting environments.

This was fixed in [revision 1022560](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1022560).

This was discovered by the Tomcat security team on 12 Oct 2010 and
made public on 5 Feb 2011.

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service and Information Disclosure
Vulnerability**
[CVE-2010-2227](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2227)

Several flaws in the handling of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header were
found that prevented the recycling of a buffer. A remote attacker could
trigger this flaw which would cause subsequent requests to fail and/or
information to leak between requests. This flaw is mitigated if Tomcat is
behind a reverse proxy (such as Apache httpd 2.2) as the proxy should
reject the invalid transfer encoding header.

This was fixed in [revision 958977](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=958977).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 14 Jun 2010 and
made public on 9 Jul 2010.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.27

**Note:** *The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.27 but the
release vote for the 6.0.27 release candidate did not pass. Therefore,
although users must download 6.0.28 to obtain a version that includes a
fix for this issue, version 6.0.27 is not included in the list of
affected versions.*

**Low: Information disclosure in authentication headers**
[CVE-2010-1157](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1157)

The `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP header for BASIC and DIGEST
authentication includes a realm name. If a
`<realm-name>` element is specified for the application
in web.xml it will be used. However, a `<realm-name>`
is not specified then Tomcat will generate realm name using the code
snippet `request.getServerName() + ":" +
request.getServerPort()`. In some circumstances this can expose
the local host name or IP address of the machine running Tomcat.

This was fixed in [revision 936540](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=936540).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 31 Dec 2009 and
made public on 21 Apr 2010.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.26

### released 21 Jan 2010 Fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.24

**Note:** *These issues were fixed in Apache Tomcat 6.0.21 but the
release votes for the 6.0.21, 6.0.22 and 6.0.23 release candidates did
not pass. Therefore, although users must download 6.0.24 to obtain a
version that includes fixes for these issues, versions 6.0.21 onwards
are not included in the list of affected versions.*

**Low: Arbitrary file deletion and/or alteration on deploy**
[CVE-2009-2693](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2693)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR files were not checked for directory
traversal attempts. This allows an attacker to create arbitrary content
outside of the web root by including entries such as
`../../bin/catalina.sh` in the WAR.

This was fixed in [revision 892815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=892815).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and
made public on 1 Mar 2010.

**Low: Insecure partial deploy after failed undeploy**
[CVE-2009-2901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2901)

By default, Tomcat automatically deploys any directories placed in a
host's appBase. This behaviour is controlled by the autoDeploy attribute
of a host which defaults to true. After a failed undeploy, the remaining
files will be deployed as a result of the autodeployment process.
Depending on circumstances, files normally protected by one or more
security constraints may be deployed without those security constraints,
making them accessible without authentication. This issue only affects
Windows platforms.

This was fixed in [revision 892815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=892815).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and
made public on 1 Mar 2010.

**Low: Unexpected file deletion in work directory**
[CVE-2009-2902](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2902)

When deploying WAR files, the WAR file names were not checked for
directory traversal attempts. For example, deploying and undeploying
`...war` allows an attacker to cause the deletion of the
current contents of the host's work directory which may cause problems
for currently running applications.

This was fixed in [revision 892815](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=892815).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 30 Jul 2009 and

**Low: Insecure default password**
[CVE-2009-3548](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3548)

The Windows installer defaults to a blank password for the administrative
user. If this is not changed during the install process, then by default
a user is created with the name admin, roles admin and manager and a
blank password.

This was fixed in [revision 881771](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=881771).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 26 Oct 2009 and

[CVE-2008-5515](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5515)

When using a RequestDispatcher obtained from the Request, the target path
was normalised before the query string was removed. A request that
included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to access
content that would otherwise be protected by a security constraint or by
locating it in under the WEB-INF directory.

This was fixed in [revision 734734](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=734734).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 11 Dec 2008 and

**Important: Denial of Service**
[CVE-2009-0033](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0033)

If Tomcat receives a request with invalid headers via the Java AJP
connector, it does not return an error and instead closes the AJP
connection. In case this connector is member of a mod\_jk load balancing
worker, this member will be put into an error state and will be blocked
from use for approximately one minute. Thus the behaviour can be used for
a denial of service attack using a carefully crafted request.

This was fixed in [revision 742915](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=742915).

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 26 Jan 2009 and

[CVE-2008-1232](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1232)

The message argument of HttpServletResponse.sendError() call is not only
displayed on the error page, but is also used for the reason-phrase of
HTTP response. This may include characters that are illegal in HTTP
headers. It is possible for a specially crafted message to result in
arbitrary content being injected into the HTTP response. For a successful
XSS attack, unfiltered user supplied data must be included in the message
argument.

This was fixed in [revision 673834](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=673834).

[CVE-2005-2090](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2090)

Requests with multiple content-length headers should be rejected as
invalid. When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat)
process a sequence of requests where one or more requests contain
multiple content-length headers and several components do not
reject the request and make different decisions as to which
content-length header to use an attacker can poison a web-cache, perform
an XSS attack and obtain sensitive information from requests other then
their own. Tomcat now returns 400 for requests with multiple
content-length headers.

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450)

Tomcat permits '\', '%2F' and '%5C' as path delimiters. When Tomcat is used
behind a proxy (including, but not limited to, Apache HTTP server with
mod\_proxy and mod\_jk) configured to only proxy some contexts, a HTTP request
containing strings like "/\../" may allow attackers to work around the context
restriction of the proxy, and access the non-proxied contexts.

The following Java system properties have been added to Tomcat to provide
additional control of the handling of path delimiters in URLs (both options
default to false):

* `org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH`: `true|false`
* `org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.ALLOW_BACKSLASH`: `true|false`

Due to the impossibility to guarantee that all URLs are handled by Tomcat as
they are in proxy servers, Tomcat should always be secured as if no proxy
restricting context access was used.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.9

[CVE-2007-1358](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1358)

Web pages that display the Accept-Language header value sent by the
client are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack if they assume
the Accept-Language header value conforms to RFC 2616. Under normal
circumstances this would not be possible to exploit, however older
versions of Flash player were known to allow carefully crafted malicious
Flash files to make requests with such custom headers. When generating
the response for `getLocale()` and `getLocales()`,
Tomcat now ignores values for Accept-Language headers that do not conform
to RFC 2616. Applications that use the raw header values directly should
not assume that the headers conform to RFC 2616 and should filter the
values appropriately.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.5

### Not a vulnerability in Tomcat

**Low: Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2012-5568](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5568)

Sending an HTTP request 1 byte at a time will consume a thread from the
connection pool until the request has been fully processed if using the
BIO or APR/native HTTP connectors. Multiple requests may be used to
consume all threads in the connection pool thereby creating a denial of
service.

Since the relationship between the client side resources and server side
resources is a linear one, this issue is not something that the Tomcat
Security Team views as a vulnerability. This is a generic DoS problem and
there is no magic solution. This issue has been discussed several times
on the Tomcat mailing lists. The best place to start to review these
discussions is the report for
[bug
54236](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54263).

This was first discussed on the public Tomcat users mailing list on 19
June 2009.

**Important: Remote Denial Of Service**
[CVE-2010-4476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4476)

A JVM bug could cause Double conversion to hang JVM when accessing to a
form based security constrained page or any page that calls
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocale() or
javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getLocales(). A specially crafted request
can be used to trigger a denial of service.

A work-around for this JVM bug was provided in
[revision 1066315](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1066315).
This work-around is included in Tomcat 6.0.32 onwards.

This was first reported to the Tomcat security team on 01 Feb 2011 and
made public on 31 Jan 2011.

Affects: 6.0.0-6.0.31

**Moderate: TLS SSL Man In The Middle**
[CVE-2009-3555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555)

A vulnerability exists in the TLS protocol that allows an attacker to
inject arbitrary requests into an TLS stream during renegotiation.

The TLS implementation used by Tomcat varies with connector. The blocking
IO (BIO) and non-blocking (NIO) connectors use the JSSE implementation
provided by the JVM. The APR/native connector uses OpenSSL.

The BIO connector is vulnerable if the JSSE version used is vulnerable.
To workaround this until a fix is available in JSSE, a new connector
attribute `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation` has been added to
the BIO connector. It should be set to `false` (the default)
to protect against this vulnerability.

The NIO connector is not vulnerable as it does not support
renegotiation.

The APR/native workarounds are detailed on the
[APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

Users should be aware that the impact of disabling renegotiation will
vary with both application and client. In some circumstances disabling
renegotiation may result in some clients being unable to access the
application.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 881774](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=881774) and
[revision 891292](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=891292)
that provided the new `allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation`
attribute. This work around is included in Tomcat 6.0.21 onwards.

Support for the new TLS renegotiation protocol (RFC 5746) that does not
have this security issue:

* For connectors using JSSE implementation provided by JVM:
  Added in Tomcat 6.0.32.

  Requires JRE that supports RFC 5746. For Oracle JRE that is
  [known](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/tlsreadme2-176330.html)
  to be 6u22 or later.
* For connectors using APR and OpenSSL:

  TBD. See
  [APR/native connector security page](security-native.html).

**Important: Directory traversal**
[CVE-2008-2938](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2938)

Originally reported as a Tomcat vulnerability the root cause of this
issue is that the JVM does not correctly decode UTF-8 encoded URLs to
UTF-8. This exposes a directory traversal vulnerability when the
connector uses `URIEncoding="UTF-8"`. This directory traversal
is limited to the docBase of the web application.

If a context is configured with `allowLinking="true"` then the
directory traversal vulnerability is extended to the entire file system
of the host server.

It should also be noted that setting
`useBodyEncodingForURI="true"` has the same effect as setting
`URIEncoding="UTF-8"` when processing requests with bodies
encoded with UTF-8.

Although the root cause was quickly identified as a JVM issue and that it
affected multiple JVMs from multiple vendors, it was decided to report
this as a Tomcat vulnerability until such time as the JVM vendors
provided updates to resolve this issue. For further information on the
status of this issue for your JVM, contact your JVM vendor.

A workaround was implemented in
[revision 678137](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=678137)
that protects against this and any similar character
encoding issues that may still exist in the JVM. This work around is
included in Tomcat 6.0.18 onwards.

**Important: Remote Memory Read**
[CVE-2014-0160](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) (a.k.a. "Heartbleed")

A bug in certain versions of [OpenSSL](www.openssl.org)
can allow an unauthenticated remote user to read certain contents of
the server's memory. Binary versions of tcnative 1.1.24 - 1.1.29
include this vulnerable version of OpenSSL. tcnative 1.1.30 and later
ship with patched versions of OpenSSL.

This issue was first announced on 7 April 2014.

Affects: OpenSSL 1.0.1-1.0.1f, tcnative 1.1.24-1.1.29

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
