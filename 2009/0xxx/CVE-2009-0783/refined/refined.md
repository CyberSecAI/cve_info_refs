Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0783:

**CVE-2009-0783**

**Summary:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that a web application could replace the XML parser used by Tomcat to process web.xml, context.xml, and tld files.

**Root Cause:**
The `ContextConfig` class in Tomcat uses the web application's classloader to create the XML parser for processing `web.xml`, `context.xml`, and TLD files. If the web application provides its own XML parser in `WEB-INF/lib`, this parser is used instead of the container's parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Parser Hijacking:** A malicious web application can include its own XML parser, which will then be used by Tomcat for processing configuration files of other applications.
- **Classloader Issue:** The root cause is the `ContextConfig` class creating the parser for web.xml using the webapp's classloader.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A rogue web application could use its own XML parser to access the contents of `web.xml`, `context.xml`, and `.tld` files of other deployed web applications. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Unauthorized Modification:** It was also possible for a rogue web application to alter the contents of configuration files of other web applications. This could lead to arbitrary behavior within those applications.
- **AccessControlException:** A web app using a custom XML parser could trigger access control exceptions if it tries to parse configurations that are protected by the app server's security policy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to deploy a malicious web application to a vulnerable Tomcat instance. This application needs to contain a custom XML parser in its WEB-INF/lib directory and must include tag library definitions to trigger the vulnerability related to .tld files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to deploy a web application on the target Tomcat server.
- The attacker has to be a user with the rights to deploy a web application.
- There is a reference to requiring that "all stock webapps" and "configurations in conf/Catalina" to be removed in order to reproduce, which might mean the app server is misconfigured.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing `web.xml`, `context.xml` and TLD files.
- The issue is similar to a class loading problem where the web application's parser is used instead of the container's parser.
- Tomcat uses the service provider mechanism to load the XML parser.
- The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that the XML parser was initialized before the classloader is set to that of the web application.

**Affected Versions:**

- Apache Tomcat 4.1.0-4.1.39
- Apache Tomcat 5.5.0-5.5.27
- Apache Tomcat 6.0.0-6.0.18

**Fix:**
- The fix was applied in Tomcat 5 by making sure the container parser is used for configuration files and TLD parsing. In Tomcat 6 the fix creates digesters and parsers earlier in the boot process to avoid using the web application’s classloader.
- Patches for this vulnerability were applied to Tomcat versions 4.1.40, 5.5.28 and 6.0.20.
