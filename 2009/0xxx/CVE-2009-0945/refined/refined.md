Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2009-0945 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A memory corruption issue exists in WebKit's handling of SVGList objects, specifically within the `insertItemBefore` method. This is due to an array index error when a negative index is used in the SVGPathList data structure, causing a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** A memory corruption vulnerability due to incorrect bounds checking when parsing malformed SVGList data structures.
*   **Input validation issues:** WebKit's lack of proper input sanitization/validation, especially when handling SVGPathList data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running the affected program or browser. In the case of Google Chrome, the code execution would be limited by the browser's sandbox.
*   **Unexpected application termination:** Visiting a malicious website may lead to the program crashing.
*   **Denial of service:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to a denial of service due to memory corruption and application crash.
*   **Privilege Escalation**:  In certain scenarios such as local Java applet loading, it can lead to privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious website hosting a crafted SVG file containing the malformed SVGList objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, User-Assisted:** The attacker needs to lure a user to visit the malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

*   **WebKit Component:**  The vulnerability resides within the WebKit rendering engine, which is used by multiple browsers.
*  **Affected data structures:** `SVGTransformList`, `SVGStringList`, `SVGNumberList`, `SVGPathSegList`, `SVGPointList`, or `SVGLengthList` objects are also vulnerable.
*   **Software Affected:**  Safari, Google Chrome, Ubuntu (various packages using webkit), KDE-Libs, iOS, and other applications leveraging the vulnerable WebKit component were affected
* **Mitigation:** Applying the security updates or patches provided by vendors such as Apple, Google, Ubuntu, and Debian addresses the vulnerability. Improvements to bounds checking, input validation, and memory handling are implemented as part of the fix.
* **Credit:**  The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Nils, working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.

**Summary of Affected Products:**

*   **Browsers:** Apple Safari, Google Chrome
*   **Operating Systems:** Apple Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server, iOS, Ubuntu, Debian
*   **Other Software:** KDE-Libs, QtWebKit, and applications using webkit components.
