        "content": "This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in the Windows remote procedure call (RPC) facility where the RPC Marshalling Engine does not update its internal state appropriately. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. Supported editions of Microsoft Windows are not delivered with any RPC servers or clients that are subject to exploitation of this vulnerability. In a default configuration, users could not be attacked by exploitation of this vulnerability. However, the vulnerability is present in the Microsoft Windows RPC runtime and could affect third-party RPC applications.\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the RPC Marshalling Engine updates its internal state.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Marshalling Engine does not update its internal state in an appropriate manner. This failure to update could lead to a pointer being read from an incorrect location. Only interfaces using the Interface Definition Language (IDL) that contain a non-conformant varying array can be affected by this issue.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "RPC Marshalling Engine does not update its internal state appropriately.",
          "Failure to update internal state could lead to a pointer being read from an incorrect location."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted RPC message and sending the message to an affected system over an affected TCP or UDP port. The message could then allow the client to write arbitrary data to memory in the RPC server address space. Only IDL interfaces containing a non-conformant varying array are affected by this issue.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to send a specially crafted RPC message to an affected system over an affected TCP or UDP port."

      {
        "content": "Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product.",
        "note": "This provides more detail than the CVE description, indicating the difficulty in creating an exploit for this vulnerability."
