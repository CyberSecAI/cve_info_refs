Some of these vulnerabilities occur when Adobe Reader and Acrobat handle files with specially crafted JBIG2 streams.\n\nAn attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to load a specially crafted Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Acrobat integrates with popular web browsers, and visiting a website is usually sufficient to cause Acrobat to load PDF content.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.",
