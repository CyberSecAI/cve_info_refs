How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

If the administrator of example.com publishes the example.com DNS data
through tinydns and axfrdns, and includes data for sub.example.com
transferred from an untrusted third party, then that third party can
control cache entries for example.com, not just sub.example.com. This is
the result of a bug in djbdns pointed out by Matthew Dempsky. (In short,
axfrdns compresses some outgoing DNS packets incorrectly.)

Even though this bug affects very few users, it is a violation of the
expected security policy in a reasonable situation, so it is a security
hole in djbdns. Third-party DNS service is discouraged in the djbdns
documentation but is nevertheless supported. Dempsky is hereby awarded
$1000.

The next release of djbdns will be backed by a new security guarantee.
In the meantime, if any users are in the situation described above,
those users are advised to apply Dempsky's patch and requested to accept
my apologies. The patch is also recommended for other users; it corrects
the bug without any side effects. A copy of the patch appears below.

The DNS protocol restricts name compression to point into the first
16384 bytes of a packet.  Line 18 of response.c from djbdns 1.05
directly references this, but response_addname() in the same file does
not enforce this at all.  The consequence of this is that names in
very large DNS packets may be mangled, and clients may misparse the
packet.

Because this email is somewhat long, I'll state up front you can find
a patch for this issue at the bottom of this email or at:
    <http://shinobi.dempsky.org/~matthew/djbdns-bug/patch>

To help demonstrate this bug, I've constructed an example attack.  In
this scenario, there's a .foo TLD operated using tinydns and axfrdns
(to support DNS queries over TCP; AXFR support is not required).  The
attacker has registered x.foo and is allowed to upload NS records for
x.foo and A records for names within the x.foo domain.  However,
because of the aforementioned bug, this attacker can construct a
record set that causes the .foo servers to respond to queries asking
about names within the x.foo domain with poisonous records for names
outside of x.foo.

Using tinydns-data and tinydns-get from stock djbdns 1.05, you can
reproduce this as follows:

    $ curl -O <http://shinobi.dempsky.org/~matthew/djbdns-bug/data>
    $ grep -c -v -e '&x\.foo::' -e '^+[^:]*\.x\.foo:' data
    0
    $ tinydns-data
    $ tinydns-get a [www.x.foo](http://www.x.foo) | grep ': foo '
    additional: foo 8388608 NS a.ns.bar
    additional: foo 8388608 NS b.ns.bar

(With the patch I linked above, no records outside of x.foo will be
served.  It's also worth noting the printpacket_cat() routine
tinydns-get uses for pretty printing the response packet is much
stricter about parsing than dnscache's parser is; e.g., it rejects
packets with extra trailing bytes and records with bad rdlength fields
on known record types.)

If a victim using dnscache now makes an A query for [www.x.foo](http://www.x.foo),
dnscache will save the poisoned records, and begin contacting the
attacker's nameservers for all .foo requests.  (The response will be
over 512 bytes long, so dnscache will have to retry the query over
TCP, which is why axfrdns is necessary too.)

Now, admittedly if you peek at data, you'll see the supplied records
exceed what most TLDs probably allow: there are redundant NS records,
there are very long names (but still within the allowed limits of the
DNS protocol), names use non-printable characters, there are over 100
records totalling about 24K of storage.  However, neither the djbdns
documentation nor standard practice warn potential .foo administrators
that their domain will be at risk for poisoning if they were to add
support for glue record sets.  (Standard practice only warns that such
absurd records can negatively impact x.foo, not .foo as well.)

A perhaps more reasonable scenario is that the .foo servers fetch the
contents of the x.foo domain over AXFR (removing any records from
outside of x.foo) and then serve the records themselves.  axfr-get,
the AXFR client from djbdns, would handle the above data set fine.

In looking for a real life example of this latter scenario, I found
freedns.afraid.org.  They allowed me to register burlap.afraid.org and
set it up as an AXFR slave to my personal server.  I have not explored
what limits they place on imported records, and their website states
they're using BIND, but assuming they're not too limiting and were to
instead use tinydns/axfrdns/axfr-get, it would be possible for me to
trick any dnscache that queries for [www.burlap.afraid.org](http://www.burlap.afraid.org) into
contacting another set of nameservers for all of afraid.org's DNS
traffic.

There's a similar service everydns.net.  They do claim to use tinydns
(and so I assume axfrdns and axfr-get) and also provide AXFR slave
support, but they did not allow me to register burlap.everydns.net.
If they did, it would probably be possible to similarly poison
everydns.net.

I've tried to search for previous reports of this issue more
thoroughly than the last bug I mentioned to the list, and I haven't
found any mention of it yet.  I emailed Dan earlier today when I first
began to suspect this bug was 'exploitable' to clarify his definition
of a 'security hole' in djbdns.  I think the afraid.org example is a
reasonable use case where this bug would violate afraid.org's security
constraints if they were to instead use djbdns.

Any thoughts from the list on this bug?  (Except from Dean Anderson;
I'm sure he'll spend the next 3 weeks now arguing I'm a blackhat
hacker while refusing to look at the patch or sample data file because
my web server might hack his computer.)

[secmartin](http://securityandthe.net/) writes *"Dan Bernstein has just admitted that a [security issue has been found in the djbdns software](http://securityandthe.net/2009/03/05/security-issue-in-djbdns-confirmed/), one of most popular alternatives for the BIND nameserver. As part of the djbdns security guarantee, $1000 will be paid to Matthew Dempsky, the researcher that found the bug. The bug allows a nameserver running djbdns to be [poisoned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_cache_poisoning) using just a single packet. Other researchers [have found a separate issue](http://www.your.org/dnscache/djbdns.pdf) that allows dnscache, the DNS cache that is also part of the djbdns package, to be poisoned within just 18 minutes when using the default configuration. Anyone using djbdns is strongly encouraged to patch their servers immediately."*
Reader emad contributes a link to the djbdns mailing list post containing both [a patch and a sample exploit](http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=123554945710038), and adds: *"In the [words of Dan Kaminsky](http://twitter.com/dakami/status/1260880457) (of recent DNS security fame): 'However, Dempsky's bug in djb's tinydns is way more surprising, if only because ... holy crap, he pulled an exploitable scenario out of THAT?!'"*

  Why would anyone trust critical internet infrastructure to a piece of software that averages a security flaw every decade?

  Real admins stick to a proven solution such as Bind.

  I run qmail by the way. DJB writes good stable software but I get the impression he is not a good listener.

    Agreed. I have issues with his 'fuck what the rest of the community does, it's my way or the high way' mentality. One of the reasons I opted for MaraDNS instead of djbdns at one of our smaller sites.

  Finding a security flaw in anything Dan Bernstein writes is definitely worthy of being on the front page, even if almost everybody uses Bind instead.

  Since I'm one of the admins who's enjoyed having an vulnerability-free djbdns installation for years, I thought I'd look more into the vuln.

  Say what you will about DJB, other than being seemingly ornery he appears to be forthright and focused on correctness. In under a week he confirms the vuln and posts a patch and awards the security guarantee money. This is the kind of behavior I want from the people who build my software. [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.djbdns/13864](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.network.djbdns/13864 "gmane.org") [gmane.org]

  Here's the bug:

  If the administrator of example.com publishes the example.com DNS data
  through tinydns and axfrdns, and includes data for sub.example.com
  transferred from an untrusted third party, then that third party can
  control cache entries for example.com, not just sub.example.com.

  How many of you are running domains like this? It's not something I need to bother patching for. Ah, I guess that's another great thing about the relative rarity of bugs. If one is found it's less likely to be relevant for your particular situation.

  The article submitter says:

  "Anyone using djbdns is strongly encouraged to patch their servers immediately."

  I think "anyone" is a bit strong here.

    I just realized this:

    The next release of djbdns will be backed by a new security guarantee.
    In the meantime, if any users are in the situation described above,
    those users are advised to apply Dempsky's patch and requested to accept
    my apologies.

    He's *apologizing*. How's that for forthright behavior? He's not being evasive. He's not pointing fingers. He's owning up to personal error, and expressing what appears to be compunction. For one bug in a decade.

    Yeah, tell me how you don't like his attitude. I think it's fine.

    Mr. Bernstein, good work I say. Thank you very much for your efforts and skill and honesty.

Package        : djbdns
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-0858
Debian Bug     : 518169

Matthew Dempsky discovered that Daniel J. Bernstein's djbdns, a Domain
Name System server, does not constrain offsets in the required manner,
which allows remote attackers with control over a third-party subdomain
served by tinydns and axfrdns, to trigger DNS responses containing
arbitrary records via crafted zone data for this subdomain.

The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain djbdns.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.05-4+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.05-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your djbdns package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
