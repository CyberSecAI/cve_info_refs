# Yaws < 1.80 - Multiple Headers Remote Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

#### EDB-ID:

###### 8148

#### CVE:

###### [2009-0751](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-0751)
...
#   Yaws before 1.80 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
#   consumption and crash) via a request with a large number of headers.
#   Refer:

```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by Yaws not properly handling requests with a large number of HTTP headers, leading to excessive memory consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of a large number of HTTP headers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted request with many headers, leading to memory exhaustion and a server crash.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an HTTP request to the Yaws server with a large number of headers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Yaws server.
