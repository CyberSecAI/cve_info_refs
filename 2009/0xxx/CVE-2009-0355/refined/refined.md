Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles the restoration of closed tabs, specifically concerning form input controls. The browser fails to properly restrict the modification of input types during the restore process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion:** The core issue is a type confusion vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the 'type' attribute of an input field during a tab restore. Specifically, an attacker can change the type attribute to `file` after the tab has been restored.
- **SessionStore Manipulation:** The `SessionStore` mechanism, responsible for storing and restoring browser sessions, is exploited to facilitate this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Theft:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to steal local files from a user's system. By changing the input type to file, an attacker can access the file system and submit the form which will leak the contents of a local file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** The attack begins with a user visiting a malicious website. The website contains specially crafted form input controls (that the attacker has prepared). The malicious website does not directly exploit the vulnerability, it only prepares the user's browser to become vulnerable.
- **Tricked Tab Restoration:** The attacker relies on the user being tricked into closing then restoring a tab which contains malicious prepared input controls. The user would need to be tricked into restoring a tab after it was closed. This action will trigger the exploit.
- **Form Submission:** After the tab is restored, malicious Javascript on the webpage then triggers the form to submit, exfiltrating the contents of the selected file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to host a website or inject malicious code into a site that a user might visit.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick the user into both visiting a malicious webpage and restoring a previously closed tab, without suspicion. This requires social engineering techniques to persuade the user to perform specific actions.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability exists because Firefox doesn't properly restrict modifications to input types during the tab restoration process.
- The exploit involves several steps from initial infection (visiting a malicious site), preparing the environment (user closes the tab), and then exploitation (user restores the tab).
- The vulnerability is specific to browsers using the `SessionStore` mechanism, such as Firefox and other Mozilla-based products.
- The attack requires some planning from the attacker, as the targeted file path should be known.
