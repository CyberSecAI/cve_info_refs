Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0250 (though the exploit also mentions CVE-2009-0275 and CVE-2009-0251)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
1.  **Insecure Password Storage:** The application stores the administrator password as a SHA1 hash in a configuration file (`/config/password`). This allows an attacker to easily retrieve the password hash.
2.  **Lack of Proper Input Sanitization:**  The application doesn't properly sanitize user inputs when editing templates. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to command injection through template editing.
3. **Insufficient Authentication:** The application does not properly authenticate users when accessing administration panel. By using the retrieved password hash, an attacker can login as admin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The most critical vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Insecure Password Handling:** Storing password hashes in a publicly accessible location exposes the administrator's password.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The retrieved password allows an attacker to login to the admin panel without proper authentication.
*  **Template Injection:** The application is vulnerable to template injection when editing templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** By exploiting the RCE vulnerability, an attacker can gain complete control of the server.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete any data stored on the server.
*   **Malware Installation:** An attacker can install malware or other malicious software.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can disrupt the server by crashing it.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit uses HTTP requests to interact with the web application.
*   **POST Requests:** POST requests are used to login as admin and then modify the template.
*   **URL Manipulation:**  The attacker manipulates the URL to execute arbitrary commands via the `cmd` parameter in `index.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable application and the specific parameters to exploit.

**More details than the CVE description**
The exploit code provides more details than the CVE description. Specifically, it details the exact steps to exploit the vulnerability:
1. Retrieve password hash from the config file
2. Login as admin using the password hash
3. Edit the template with malicious PHP code to allow for command execution
4. Execute arbitrary commands by using `cmd` parameter.
