Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0256:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The TYPO3 authentication library does not invalidate a supplied session identifier upon user authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The vulnerability allows for session fixation attacks. This occurs because after a user authenticates, the existing session ID is not invalidated, allowing an attacker to potentially hijack an existing session by forcing a user to use a session ID known to the attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can take over a victim's session. This means the attacker can impersonate the legitimate user, potentially gaining access to the user's account and its associated data/privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can supply a user with a specific session identifier.
*   When the user authenticates (via the frontend or backend), TYPO3 does not generate a new session, but the supplied one stays valid.
*   The attacker can then use this supplied session identifier to impersonate the user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply the victim with a session identifier. This might be achieved via crafted links, scripts, or other forms of user interaction.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the TYPO3 system; they can perform the attack remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix requires an update to TYPO3 versions 4.0.10, 4.1.8, or 4.2.4
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by a member of the TYPO3 Security Team, Marcus Krause.
