{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Transparent proxy servers make connection decisions based on HTTP header values instead of source and destination IP addresses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper reliance on HTTP headers for connection decisions in transparent proxy servers.",
      "Lack of validation of HTTP Host header."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can relay connections to any website or resource that the proxy can connect to, including internal resources not normally exposed to the Internet.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Forging HTTP host-header (or other HTTP headers) via active content (e.g., Flash, Java).",
        "Convincing a user to visit a malicious page with active content."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute active content within a user's browser or convince a user to visit a malicious web page. This content would forge the HTTP headers sent to the vulnerable proxy.",
      "additional_information": "This vulnerability only affects proxy servers that run in transparent mode. Browser same-origin policies prevent attackers from reusing authentication credentials (cookies, etc) to gain further access."
