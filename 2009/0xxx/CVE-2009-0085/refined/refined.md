        "root_cause": "The SChannel authentication component does not sufficiently validate Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake messages, specifically, it does not verify the client's access to the private key associated with the presented certificate.",

          "Insufficient validation of TLS handshake messages",
          "Lack of proper private key verification during certificate-based authentication"

The update modifies the way the server parses key exchange data during the TLS handshake to address the vulnerability."
