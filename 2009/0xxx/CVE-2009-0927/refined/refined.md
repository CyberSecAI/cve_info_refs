It is triggered when a crafted argument is passed to the getIcon() method of a Collab object, due to insufficient bounds checking in the JavaScript engine. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file/visit a malicious web site containing the exploit."
