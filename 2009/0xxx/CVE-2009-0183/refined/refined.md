Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0183

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Remote Control Server component of Free Download Manager (FDM). This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the `Authorization` header within an HTTP request.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. Alternatively, the exploit can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the FDM Remote Control Server.
   - The attacker must include an excessively long string in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs network access to the system running the vulnerable FDM Remote Control Server.
   - The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
   - The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable service.

**Versions Affected:**
- Free Download Manager (FDM) 2.5 Build 758
- Free Download Manager (FDM) 3.0 Build 844

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit provided is a proof-of-concept (PoC) written in Perl demonstrating the vulnerability.
- This exploit uses a long string of "D" characters for the `Authorization` header in order to cause the buffer overflow.
