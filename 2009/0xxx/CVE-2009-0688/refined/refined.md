{
  "CVE-2009-0688": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Cyrus SASL library, specifically in the `sasl_encode64()` function, due to improper string termination during Base64 encoding.",
    "Root cause": "The `sasl_encode64()` function in Cyrus SASL does not properly null-terminate strings in certain situations, leading to buffer overflows when applications that use the library and rely on null-termination use the output.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper String Termination"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could send specially crafted packets to a daemon using Cyrus-SASL, potentially causing arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the daemon or triggering a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker needs to send specially crafted packets to a service using Cyrus SASL."
  }
