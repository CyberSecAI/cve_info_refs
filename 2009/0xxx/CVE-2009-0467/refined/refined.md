{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Profense Web Application Firewall 2.6.2 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change the firewall's configuration (DNS, SMTP, NTP servers), set a malicious remote FTP or SCP server for configuration theft, configure a remote syslog server to steal logs, enable SSH or SNMP, add a proxy, shutdown the firewall, or force it to ping an arbitrary IP. Furthermore, by using XSS, the attacker can steal cookies and possibly gain access to the firewall. ",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "CSRF: By crafting malicious URLs or HTML forms, an attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions on the firewall's interface.",
    "XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `proxy.html` page through the `show` parameter, an attacker can execute code in the context of a user's browser."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious link (CSRF), or by injecting a malicious script via a vulnerable parameter on the page. The attacker needs network access to the firewall."
