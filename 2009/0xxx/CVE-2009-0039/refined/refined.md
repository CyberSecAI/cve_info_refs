Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-0039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) protection in the Apache Geronimo web administration console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF/XSRF Vulnerability:** The web administration console is susceptible to CSRF attacks due to the absence of proper protection mechanisms. This allows an attacker to potentially forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack can allow a remote attacker to perform administrative actions on the server without the administrator's direct knowledge or consent.
- The attacker can leverage predictable URLs to execute administrative actions once the user is authenticated and has an active session.
- Examples of actions an attacker could perform include:
  - Changing the web administration password.
  - Uploading malicious applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker is external to the application and can be located anywhere on the internet or local network.
- **Malicious Website/Link:** The attacker typically tricks a user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a specially crafted link while the user is logged into the vulnerable application.
- **Predictable URL Requests:** The attacker crafts a URL that performs a specific administrative action, relying on the victim's active authenticated session with the web administration console.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into executing a malicious request (e.g. through a malicious web page or a crafted link).
- The attacker doesn't require direct access to the application server but must be able to get the user to initiate the malicious request.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the application's URL structure to construct forged requests that perform the desired malicious actions.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- The vulnerability affects all full JavaEE Geronimo assemblies or other distributions that include the administration web console, up to and including Apache Geronimo 2.1.3.
- A fix was implemented in Apache Geronimo 2.1.4, 2.1.5 and 2.2.
- A workaround is to stop or undeploy the administration web console application.
- The Apache Geronimo project credits Digital Security Research Group (dsecrg.com) for reporting and assisting in validating the fix for this issue.
- The fix included adding a servlet filter to check for XSS and XSRF vulnerabilities and directory checks.
