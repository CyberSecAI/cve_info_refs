  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-0465",
      "description": "The Synactis All_IN_THE_BOX ActiveX control (ALL_IN_THE_BOX.OCX) version 3 is vulnerable to a null byte file overwrite. The SaveDoc() method, when saving a file, appends the .box extension to the filename. However, by inserting a null byte (%00) into the filename, an attacker can overwrite any file on the target system.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the filename in the SaveDoc() method, allowing an attacker to use a null byte to truncate the filename and overwrite any arbitrary file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Null byte injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can overwrite any file on the target system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a critical system file is targeted. This can also lead to denial of service or complete system compromise depending on the overwritten file.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote, through a web page that embeds the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that exploits the vulnerable ActiveX control using a specially crafted filename with an embedded null byte. No other special capabilities are required and a user visiting a malicious webpage is vulnerable."
