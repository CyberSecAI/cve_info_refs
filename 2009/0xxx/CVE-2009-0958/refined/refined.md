Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how iOS handles untrusted Exchange server certificates. When a user accepts an untrusted certificate, the system stores an exception on a per-hostname basis.
*   Subsequently, when visiting an Exchange server listed in the exception list, the stored certificate is accepted without prompting the user or performing validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Certificate Handling:** The core issue is the lack of proper re-validation of certificates after an initial exception is made, leading to a bypass of certificate verification.
*   **Lack of User Notification:**  The user is not prompted or notified about the acceptance of a previously untrusted certificate for subsequent connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** This vulnerability could allow a malicious Exchange server to intercept communication, potentially leading to the disclosure of user credentials or application data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker could set up a malicious Exchange server with a self-signed or otherwise invalid certificate.
*   **Initial Connection:** The user must initially connect to the attacker's malicious server and accept the untrusted certificate exception.
*   **Subsequent Connection:** After the initial exception is stored, the user's device will automatically trust the malicious server on future connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or redirect the user's connection to their malicious Exchange server.
*   **Malicious Server Setup:** The attacker needs to host a malicious Exchange server with a certificate that will initially be considered untrusted.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must initially accept the untrusted certificate.
