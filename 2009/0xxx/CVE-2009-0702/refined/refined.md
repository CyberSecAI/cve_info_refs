Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0702

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `com_phocadocumentation` component for Joomla! is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter in the URL. The component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
- Improper input sanitization/validation.
- Direct use of user-provided data in SQL queries without proper escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially allowing them to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, other user data).
    - Modify or delete database records.
    - Potentially gain complete control over the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable through an HTTP GET request with a crafted `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! site.
- No authentication is required in the provided exploit to access the vulnerable parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Perl exploit demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability using a crafted URL:
```
/index.php?option=com_phocadocumentation&view=section&id=1+AND+1=2+UNION+SELECT+concat(username,0x3a,password),1,2+from/**/jos_users--
```
- This URL injects a SQL UNION statement to extract the `username` and `password` fields from the `jos_users` table.
- The provided exploit uses `concat(username,0x3a,password)` to combine username and password. `0x3a` is the colon (:) character, acting as separator.

**More Details than CVE:**
- The exploit provides a specific SQL injection payload for extracting user credentials, as well as the vulnerable URL structure. This level of detail is not typically present in basic CVE descriptions, which often broadly describe the vulnerability type and affected component.
