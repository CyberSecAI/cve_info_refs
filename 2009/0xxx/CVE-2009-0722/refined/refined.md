```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application includes a file based on a user-controlled cookie value without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `admin.php` file uses the `user` cookie to construct a file path for inclusion: `include ("data/users/$id.php");`
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application is vulnerable to LFI due to the lack of sanitization of the cookie value, which allows an attacker to control the path of the included file.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read local files from the server's filesystem by manipulating the `user` cookie value. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including source code, configuration files, and system files, such as `/etc/passwd`.
- Attack vectors: The attacker manipulates the `user` cookie with a crafted payload, such as `"user=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00; path=/"`. The `%00` is a null byte injection intended to terminate the string and bypass additional checks on the path.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to set a cookie value for the target application, which is typically done through a web browser. No special network position is needed; a standard client-server connection is sufficient.
