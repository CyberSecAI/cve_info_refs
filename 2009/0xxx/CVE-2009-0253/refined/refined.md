Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0253:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a status bar obfuscation/clickjacking issue in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5. This occurs because an attacker can overlay a small, transparent div element over a legitimate link. When the user moves their mouse over the legitimate link, JavaScript dynamically moves the div to track the mouse cursor, and its `onmouseover` event redirects the user to a malicious URL (milw0rm.com in the provided example) instead of the intended URL (google.com). This technique misleads the user as the browser's status bar shows the legitimate URL while the actual redirection goes to the attacker's site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Status Bar Obfuscation:** The attacker manipulates the displayed URL in the status bar, leading the user to believe they are going to a legitimate website.
*   **Clickjacking:** The attacker makes the user believe they are clicking on a legitimate link while they are interacting with a hidden malicious element.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites to steal credentials or install malware.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting to websites hosting malicious software, potentially infecting the user's system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposing users to compromised or fake websites, leading to the theft of sensitive information.
*   **Social Engineering:** Gaining user trust to trick them into performing actions that benefit the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is primarily client-side and involves:

*   **Web Page/HTML Injection:** An attacker injects malicious HTML and JavaScript into a web page.
*   **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the page and moves their mouse over the deceptive link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into a website**. This could be through:
    *   Compromising a legitimate website
    *   Hosting their own malicious site
    *   Through other vulnerabilities

*   **No special position on the network is required**, only the ability to host or inject the attack into a webpage the user will interact with.
