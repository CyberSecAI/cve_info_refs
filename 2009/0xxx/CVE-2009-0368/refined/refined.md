Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- OpenSC, a set of smart card utilities, stores private data on a smart card without proper access restrictions. Specifically, while the PKCS#11 implementation requires PIN verification, low-level APDU commands or debugging tools can access the private data without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** Private data objects on smart cards initialized with OpenSC are not adequately protected. Low-level access methods bypass the intended PIN-based access controls.
- **Programming Error:** The vulnerability is described as a "programming error" in the Debian Security Advisory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read private data stored on a smart card.
- **Bypass of PIN Protection:** The intended security mechanism (PIN verification) can be bypassed by directly accessing the smart card's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** Attackers need physical access to the smart card.
- **Low-Level Access Tools:** Attackers can use tools like `opensc-explorer` or `opensc-tool` to access the data without proper authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Proximity:** The attacker needs physical access to the smart card.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs some technical knowledge to use low-level smart card tools.
- **Local Access to System:** The attacker also requires a system with OpenSC installed in order to interface with the smart card.

**Additional Details:**
- Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected. Cards initialized with other software or national eID cards are not vulnerable.
- The fix in OpenSC 0.11.7 and later addresses how *new* private data objects are created. Cards initialized with vulnerable versions need to be manually fixed.
- The vulnerability affects all drivers (although only a few cards were tested during the fix).
- The recommended fix includes downloading private data objects, deleting them, and then re-storing them with the fixed OpenSC version, or erasing the card and re-initializing, at the cost of losing all card data, including RSA private keys.
