**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTML document viewed by the user. This could be a malicious web page or an HTML email/attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML document and entice a user with the vulnerable software installed to view it. No special position is required beyond this.
