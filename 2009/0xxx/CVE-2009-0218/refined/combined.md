## Particle Software IntraLaunch Application Launcher ActiveX control fails to restrict access to dangerous methods

#### Vulnerability Note VU#908801

Original Release Date: 2009-04-06 | Last Revised: 2016-08-12

---

### Overview

The Particle Software IntraLaunch Application Launcher ActiveX control allows arbitrary code execution.

### Description

| Particle Software [IntraLaunch](http://www.particlesoftware.com/en/index.html) is an ActiveX control that "*... allows web page links to execute anything from applications to associations such as Word or Acrobat PDF documents both locally and across a network without prompts or security warnings.*" The IntraLaunch ActiveX control, which is provided by IntraLaunch.ocx, is marked Safe for Scripting and by default is not restricted to any specific domain or Internet Explorer zone. This means that any web site has the ability to run arbitrary code on a system that has the control.  Note that a vendor may purchase a [site-locked version](http://www.particlesoftware.com/en/security.html) of the IntraLaunch control, but by default the control is not restricted. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable the IntraLaunch ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:{0AE533FE-B805-4FD6-8AE1-A619FBEE7A23}{58FEBB79-70F5-48A6-9697-E91591DA3F8E}{858B4F85-E945-4F0C-AF65-059E0AD9EEC0}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0AE533FE-B805-4FD6-8AE1-A619FBEE7A23}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{58FEBB79-70F5-48A6-9697-E91591DA3F8E}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{858B4F85-E945-4F0C-AF65-059E0AD9EEC0}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |

### [LDRA Software Technology](#MAPG-7PYRP4) Affected

Notified:  March 09, 2009  Updated: August 12, 2016

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The LDRA TBbrowse component uses the Microsoft Internet Explorer HTML framework to implement an HTML report viewer. The IntraLaunch.ocx control allows these reports to include active links to other reports.

The use of IntraLaunch is optional, and the user is asked to confirm their wish to include it as part of the installation.

As of LDRA 9.45 the ActiveX control can be disabled without loss of report functionality. As of LDRA 9.57, the IntraLaunch ActiveX control is no longer provided.

### Vendor Information

Disabling IntraLaunch via the “kill-bit” is not a viable option if a user wishes to make use of the intra-report links displayed within TBbrowse.
However, given the vulnerability noted in VU#908801 it is still advisable to take appropriate security measures:

1. Disable the use of ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone or ensure that any affected machine does not have access to the internet (e.g. via firewall settings).
2. Ensure that any affected machine does not have access to any other untrusted network that may be used as an attack vector.
   ### Vendor References

   None

   ### Addendum

### [Particle Software](#WDON-7Q4RZN) Affected

Notified:  February 13, 2009  Updated: August 12, 2016

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

There is no real security problem here at all. Its the nature of the program, everyone is aware of it and its all public. If they don't want it they just uninstall (<http://www.particlesoftware.com/en/uninstall.html>) it.
