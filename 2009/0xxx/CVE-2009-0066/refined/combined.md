### Attacking Intel® Trusted Execution Technology

Press people: please read [our press release](http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-01.pdf) first and also refer to the disclaimer at the end of this blog post. Thank you!

Update: 1/5/2009 19:21 CEST: minor typos/spelling corrections. Thanks to Jarred for point out some of the typos.

A word about Trusted Computing
The term Trusted Computing and related technologies, like Palladium, Trusted Platform Module, LaGrande, have always caused lots of controversy in the IT world. Most of the fear, however, has been a result of the lack of understanding of how a particular technology really works.

Nevertheless, Trusted Computing is becoming part of our lives, whether we want it or not. These days almost every new laptop comes with an on-board Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Microsoft's Palladium initiative have been renamed so many times in the recent years, that probably even people working at Microsoft are confused now. Nevertheless, some of the Palladium technologies made their way into Vista, and Microsoft BitLocker is, without doubt, the most successful, widely deployed product that is based on the idea of Trusted Computing. (In fact the Bitlocker is the only one thing that I really have been missing since I switched from Vista to Mac some time ago).

On the hardware side, besides the famed TPM, we also have had the LaGrande technology, that is often connected with things such as Remote Attestation, Protected Execution and other scary terms…

A word about Trusted Execution Technology
LaGrande, recently renamed [Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)](http://www.intel.com/technology/security/), is Intel's response to the Trusted Computing trend. TXT is currently part of the [vPro™ brand](http://www.intel.com/products/vpro/index.htm), and for about a year now users can buy a vPro/TXT compatible hardware in regular computer stores (the first one was the [DQ35J desktop board](http://www.intel.com/products/desktop/motherboards/dq35jo/dq35jo-overview.htm) with certain Core 2 Duo processors, which I was able to buy at the end of 2007 — remember that TXT requires support from both the CPU and the chipset).

TXT is not an alternative to TPM, in fact TXT heavily relies on the TPM to provide basic services like e.g. secure storage of measurements done by the TXT. Also, Palladium, or whatever it is called these days, is not a competition to TXT. Intel TXT can provide building blocks to e.g. Vista Bitlocker, arguably making it more secure then it is now (Current Bitlocker implementation, AFAIK, relies on a so called Static Root of Trust for Measurement, which requires TPM, but not TXT).

What kind of measurement would TXT like to store in our TPM? Well, the whole TXT is, in fact, all about making and storing software measurements, or, using a more familiar language, secure hashes of certain software components.

The sole purpose of Intel TXT technology is to provide a trusted way for loading and executing system software, e.g. Operating System kernel or Virtualization Machine Monitor. What is extraordinary here is that TXT doesn't make any assumptions about the state of the system before loading the software, thus making it possible for a user to ensure secure load of an OS or VMM, even in a potentially compromised machine.

In other words, our system can be all full of boot sector viruses and BIOS rootkits, and god-knows-what-else, and still TXT should allow to load a clean VMM (or OS kernel) in a secure way, immune to all those rootkits present in the system in a moment just before the load process. This TXT-supported load process is called Late Launch, and is implemented via a special new CPU instruction called SENTER.

It's a good place to mention that AMD has its own version of the late launch implemented via SKINIT instruction. We haven't looked at the AMD technology thoroughly yet, so I will refrain from commenting on this.

The late launch is a pretty amazing thing, when we think about. It promises to effectively provide all the benefits of a computer restart without actually restarting it.

It is hard to overemphasize the potential impact that a technology such as TXT could have on computer security. One can immediately see that it could eliminate all the system-level persistent malware — in other words we can easily build systems (VMMs or even standard OSes) that would be immune to attacks that try to compromise system binaries on disk, or attack the system right from the bootloader or BIOS. Combining this with VT-x and VT-d technologies, system developers (for the first time, at least as far as the "PC" platform is considered) have gotten extremely strong tools into their hands that should allow them to create really secure VMMs and OSes…

Hopefully by now, my Dear Reader, you should have the feeling what kind of an animal Intel TXT is and how desperately the world needs it...

And now, we are going to move on and show practical attacks on current TXT implementations... :)

Attacking Intel TXT!
Ok, not in this post today, but rather at the [upcoming Black Hat conference](http://blackhat.com/html/bh-dc-09/bh-dc-09-speakers.html#Wojtczuk) in Washington, DC in February. Over the recent months, Rafal and I have been looking at the Intel TXT technology as part of a work done for a customer, to see if this could be used to improve security of a product, from a typical user's perspective. We figured out that it definitely could, but that there are also some issues…

And those "issues" gave us a starting point in developing a proof-of-concept (albeit very reliable) exploit that shows how we can bypass trusted boot process implemented by Intel's tboot.

Tboot, which is also [part of](http://lxr.xensource.com/lxr/source) (scroll down to the end of the page) the Xen hypervisor, can be though of as a reference implementation of TXT-based system loader, that could be used to securely load either the Xen hypervisor or the Linux kernel, when run on a vPro/TXT compatible hardware.

[copy-and-paste from [the press release](http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-01.pdf) follows]

Our attack comprises two stages. The first stage requires an implementation flaw in a specific system software. The second stage of the attack is possible thanks to a certain design decision made in the current TXT release.

While evaluating the effectiveness of the Intel® TXT technology, as part of a work done for a customer, we have identified several implementation flaws in the Intel's system software, which allowed to conduct the above mentioned stage-one attack. We have provided Intel with extensive description of the flaws in December 2008, and Intel is currently working on fixing those vulnerabilities.

We have also been in touch with Intel about the possibility of conducting the second-stage attack since November 2008. In December, after providing Intel with the details about the first-stage attack, Intel promised to release, in the coming weeks, an updated TXT specification for developers that would explain how to design their TXT-based loaders in such a way that they are immune to our attack. Intel claims the current Intel® TXT release does contain the basic building blocks that could be used to prevent our second-stage attack and the release of the additional specification would make it feasible in practice.

More details in February in DC :)

TXT useless?
Some people are skeptical about the TXT technology, and not only because of the Irrational Fear of the Trusted Computing (IFTC), but rather because they point out to the complexity of the whole technology. The complexity is bad, because 1) it leaves more space for potential attacks, and 2) it discourages developers (ISVs) from using the technology in their products (e.g. neither Microsoft, nor VMWare make use of TXT in any of their bare-metal hypervisors, even though TXT is very well suited for this kind of software).

It is true that TXT is a very complex technology (the SENTER instruction is probably the masterpiece of the CISC architecture!), but I personally like it. In my opinion this is the first technology available for the PC platform that has the potential to really change something, much more then the NX-feature did a few years ago. Before people will run to the comment box — if you would like to argue about the usefulness/uselessness of Trusted Computing/TXT, please base your opinions on technical facts (read the spec!) and not on your feelings!

Disclaimer (for press)

Starting January 2009, we (at Invisible Things Lab), decided to issue [press releases](http://invisiblethingslab.com/itl/News.html) in addition to this blog. The general rule is: press releases are written for journalists, while the blog is mainly written for other researchers, security enthusiast, etc.

The wording of our press releases is carefully chosen to minimize the potential of a possible misinterpretation. The press releases carry less information, but, we think, are better suited for a more general public, that doesn't have background in computer science, programming and security.

The blog is written in a much more casual way, without thinking for half an hour on every sentence. The articles on this blog might present some facts as extremely exciting, because e.g. for me, a person deeply involved in a system-level security research, they indeed might be very exciting, which might not be the case for a general audience. I sometimes might also use shortcuts, metaphors, or irony, and other figures of speech, that might not necessarily be obvious for a more general public.

If you are a journalist and you think you just found something very sensational on my blog, I would suggest that you double-check with me, before writing about it.

Thank you for your cooperation.

I'm glad somebody in the non-corporate security community is willing to stand up for TC. I've been interested in this technology for a long time, and have recently given a tech talk on it here at Google, but a lot of people hear the words "trusted computing" and switch off.

BTW I think the reason Microsoft and VMware don't use TXT is that it's really not ready yet. The tboot reference implementation still requires quite obscure hardware and BIOS reflashing to work properly, and TXT doesn't yet provide any trusted I/O, making it useless for a large/interesting set of applications.

@Mike: The tboot versions we played with (recent ones) do not require any BIOS reflashing, at least on Q35 Intel boards. I would expect any fairly recent BIOS to support TXT as well.

Trusted I/O -- I assume you mean Protected Input/Output as it is called in The Grawrock's Book -- this is sort of an additional mechanism and I'm not even sure if it will make it to the TXT anytime soon. Protected In/Out, as I understand it, is more a DRM-like thing, rather then something for building secure VMMs/OSes.

I think that current TXT + VT-x + VT-d has already excellent potential, even without this Protected Input/Ouput feature.

Hey Joanna,
Really interesting stuff, but I think the attack is based on the OS loader and how the tboot is actually launched during the boot process... still lots more to read I guess lol..

@anonymous: nice to see people start speculating about our attack, although you're totally wrong in your guess :P As I wrote, the attack is fairly generic and doesn't depend on the particular implementation of the loader, e.g. tboot. In other words, tboot will not have to be patched to prevent the attack.

### WAF Virtual Patching Challenge: Securing WebGoat with ModSecurity

Identification of web application vulnerabilities is only half the battle with remediation efforts as the other. Let's face the facts, there are many real world business scenarios
where it is not possible to update web application code in either a timely manner or at all. This is where the tactical use-case of implementing a web application firewall to address identified issues proves its worth.

This talk will provide an overview of the recommended practices for utilizing a web application firewall for virtual patching. After discussing the framework to use, we will then
present a very interesting OWASP Summer of Code Project where the challenge was to attempt to mitigate as many of the OWASP WebGoat vulnerabilities as possible using the open source
[ModSecurity web application firewall](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Securing_WebGoat_using_ModSecurity_Project). During the talk, we will discuss both WebGoat and ModSecurity
and provide in-depth walk-throughs of some of the complex fixes. Examples will include addressing not only attacks but the underlying vulnerabilities, using data persistence for
multiple-step processes, content injection and even examples of the new LUA programming language API. The goal of this talk is to both highlight cutting edge mitigation options
using a web application firewall and to show how it can effectively be used by security consultants who traditionally could only offer source code fixes.

Ryan C. Barnett is the Director of Application Security Research at Breach Security. He is also a Faculty Member for the SANS Institute, Team
Lead for the Center for Internet Security Apache Benchmark Project and a Member of the Web Application Security Consortium where he leads the Distributed Open
Proxy Honeypot Project. Mr. Barnett has also authored a web security book for Addison/Wesley Publishing entitled "Preventing Web Attacks with Apache."

## Cesar Cerrudo

### SQL Server Anti-Forensics

This presentation is about how SQL Server can be attacked leaving as few evidence as possible, so in case someone suspects of a possible incident then the
techniques used in the attack will make forensics investigation harder because lack of tracks or confusing tracks. While this presentation is focused on
Anti-Forensics, forensics techniques for SQL Server will be learned from the Anti-Forensics ones and from the concepts and theory explained. At the end
it will be discussed of how to protect your servers against these attacks.

Cesar Cerrudo
is the lead researcher for Application Security Incâs Team SHATTER and is the founder and CEO of Argeniss (www.argeniss.com), a security consultancy firm based in Argentina. He is a security researcher and consultant specializing in application security. Regarded as a leading application security researcher, Cesar is credited with discovering and helping to eliminate dozens of vulnerabilities in leading applications including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle database server, IBM DB2, Microsoft BizTalk Server,

application security, attacks and exploitation techniques and he has been invited to present at a variety of companies and conferences including Microsoft, Black Hat, Bellua, CanSecWest,
EuSecWest, WebSec. HITB, Microsoft BlueHat, etc. Cesar collaborates with and is regulary quoted in print and online publications including eWeek, ComputerWorld, and other leading journals.

## Matthew Flick

### XSS Anonymous Browser

Current anonymous Internet browsing applications build dynamic routes using a
network of willing hosts and layers of encryption along the route. The cross
site scripting anonymous browser ("XAB") exploits vulnerable web
sites/applications and victim browsers to build a network of drones. The intent
of XAB is not to replace the current applications, such as Tor, but rather to
provide an alternative that does not require willing participants and further
stretches the functionality and intent of JavaScript and other browser
technology.

Matt Flick has, for more than 8 years, developed his career in the information security industry, with expertise in application security and other areas within information security management, services, and auditing. Matt has worked with both commercial and federal government clients to help plan, develop, and assess their information security programs. Matt is currently a Principal with FYRM Associates Inc., an information security professional services organization, and a member of OWASP DC, ISACA and ISSA.

## Trey Ford

### **Alternate** Get Rich or Die Trying - "Making Money on The Web, The Black Hat Way"

Forget Cross-Site Scripting. Forget SQL Injection. If you want to make some serious cash on the Web silently and surreptitiously,
you donât need them. You also donât need noisy scanners, sophisticated proxies, 0-days, or ninja level reverse engineering skillsâall
you need is a Web browser, a clue on what to look for, and a few black hat tricks. Generating affiliate advertising revenue from the
Website traffic of others, trade stock using corporation information passively gleaned, inhibit the online purchase of sought after
items creating artificial scarcity, and so much more. Activities not technically illegal, only violating terms of service. You may
have heard these referred to as business logic flaws, but the name really doesnât do them justice. It sounds so academic and benign
in that context when the truth is anything but. These are not the same olâ Web hacker attack techniques everyone is familiar with,
but the one staring you in the face and missed because gaming a system and making money this way couldnât be that simple. Complicate
this furtherâIDS cannot detect them and Web application firewalls canât block them. If fact, these types of attacks are so hard to
detect (if anyone is actually trying) we arenât even sure how widespread their use actually is. Time to pull back the cover and expose
whatâs possible.

lead at FishNet Security.

## Xinwen Fu

### One Cell is Enough to Break Tor's Anonymity

Tor is a real-world, circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication
network, supporting TCP applications over the Internet. In this talk, we will
present a new class of attacks, protocol-level attacks, against Tor. Different
from existing attacks, these attacks can confirm anonymous communication
relationships quickly and accurately by manipulating one single cell and pose a
serious threat against Tor. In protocol-level attacks, a malicious entry onion
router may duplicate, modify, insert, or delete cells of a TCP stream from a
sender. The manipulated cells traverse middle onion routers and arrive at an
exit onion router along a circuit. Because Tor uses the counter mode AES
(AES-CTR) for encrypting cells, the manipulated cells disrupt the normal counter
at exit onion routers and decryption at the exit onion router incurs cell
recognition errors, which are unique to the investigated protocol-level attacks.
If an accomplice of the attacker at the entry onion router also controls the
exit onion router and recognizes such cell recognition errors, the communication
relationship between the sender and receiver will be confirmed. Protocol-level
attacks can also be used for launching the denial-of-service (DoS) attack to
disrupt the operation of Tor. We systematically analyze the impact of these
attacks. We have implemented these attacks on Tor and our experiments validate
their effectiveness and efficiency. We also present guidelines for defending
against such attacks.

Xinwen Fu is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science,
University of Massachusetts Lowell. He has been teaching classes on software security, intrusion
detection, digital forensics and basic computer security stuff. The presentations from Black Hat
Briefings are his favorite class materials. He tried his best to demonstrate those tricks to
students. "Hack Proofing Your Network" was the textbook for his classes, software security and
intrusion detection. Dr. Fu's current research interests are in network security and privacy. He has
been building systems, and hacking kernels and systems through his research. He believes that hacking
plays a key role in making systems secure.

## Travis Goodspeed

### Reversing and Exploiting Wireless Sensors

Wireless sensors will soon be part of many industrial, military, and home networks. Of the various networking protocols—Zigbee,
ISA100, Wireless HART, 6LowPAN, and others--none has yet become a definitive standard. Neither have vendors standardized upon a given
operating system, compiler, or microcontroller. Users of these sensor networks are often given no command-line, no internal documentation,
and no access to the internals of each device.

This lecture provides a thorough introduction to reverse engineering such devices, both in hardware and in software. Along the way,
plenty of methods of exploiting and patching them will be covered.

Travis Goodspeed is a neighborly fellow from Knoxville in Southern Appalachia. He has spoken at ToorCon 9 and the Texas Instruments Developer's
Conference regarding stack overflow exploits of the MSP430-based wireless sensor networks. At Black Hat 2008, he demonstrated a timing attack
which allows confidential code to be extracted from recent revisions of the chip. Having demonstrated that such attacks are possible, his present
research is aimed at porting defense techniques to low-power embedded systems.

## Vincenzo Iozzo

### Let Your Mach-O Fly

Mac OS X is starting to spread among users, as such new exploitation
techniques have to be discovered. Even if a lot of interesting ways of exploitation on OSX were presented in
the past, the lack of anti-forensics techniques is clear.
The talk is focused on an in memory injection technique. Specifically how
it is possible to inject into a victim's machine any kind of binaries ranging from your own piece of
code to real applications like Safari.
This is accomplished without leaving traces on the hard disk and without creating a new process, since the whole
exploitation is performed in memory.
If an attacker is able to execute code in the target machine, it is possible to run this attack instead of a classic shellcode and to use it
as a trampoline for higher-lever payloads.
Other similar payloads like meterpreter or meterpretux exist but none of them is able to run on Mac OS X. Besides many of those techniques require to run
specific crafted binaries, that way precompiled applications are left out from the possible range of payloads.

Vincenzo Iozzo is a student at the Politecnico di Milano where he does some research regarding malware and IDS. He is involved
in a number of open source projects, including FreeBSD due to Google Summer of Code. He also works as a security consultant for Secure Network,
an Italian company, and as a reverse engineer for Zynamics.

## Prajakta Jagdale

### Blinded by Flash: Widespread Security Risks Flash Developers Don't See

In this presentation I will examine the Flash framework and then delve into
the Flash security model and the transitions it has undergone over the years. To
explore the avenues of compromise in the security model, I will use a test Flash
application and demonstrate various attack vectors including Cross-Site Request
Forgery, data injection and script injection. During this demonstration, I will
explain the associated threats in detail and discuss means to mitigate these
threats. Even though the test application validates the attack surface, the
question remains: how many applications actually deployed are vulnerable to
these threats? I will answer this question by providing astonishing statistics
about vulnerable, real world applications I was able to find using simple
Google queries.

Prajakta Jagdale is a Research Engineer with the HP Web Security Research Group. Prajakta focuses on
automated discovery of Web application vulnerabilities and crawling technologies. Her current research efforts are concentrated towards
identifying security risks associated with RIA technologies. This research involves developing innovative techniques to enable automated
web assessment tools to crawl and analyze RIA applications through the use of both static source code analysis and dynamic runtime analysis.

## William Kimball

### Emulation-based Software Protection Providing Encrypted Code Execution and Page Granularity Code Signing

We present an original emulation-based software protection scheme providing
protection from reverse code engineering (RCE) and software exploitation using
encrypted code execution and page-granularity code signing, respectively.
Protection mechanisms execute in trusted emulators while remaining out-of-band
of untrusted systems being emulated. This protection scheme is called SecureQEMU
and is based on a modified version of Quick Emulator. RCE uncovers the internal
workings of a program. It is used during vulnerability and intellectual property
(IP) discovery. To protect from RCE program code may have anti-disassembly,
anti-debugging, and obfuscation techniques incorporated. These techniques slow
the process of RCE, however, once defeated protected code is still
comprehensible. Encryption provides static code protection, but encrypted code
must be decrypted before execution. SecureQEMUs' scheme overcomes this
limitation by keeping code encrypted during execution. Software exploitation
leverages design and implementation errors to cause unintended behavior which
may result in security policy violations. Traditional exploitation protection
mechanisms provide a blacklist approach to software protection. Specially
crafted exploit payloads bypass these protection mechanisms. SecureQEMU
provides a whitelist approach to software protection by executing signed code
exclusively. Unsigned malicious code (exploits, backdoors, rootkits, etc.)
remain unexecuted, therefore, protecting the system.

William Kimball has a M.S. in Cyber Operations from the Air Force Institute of Technology,
a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Dayton, and is currently a research assistant for the Center for Cyberspace
Research. Kimball is the developer of Fylasso Antivulnerability, ShellDeny, L.E.V.I. (released BlackHat U.S. 06), the
Vulnerability Discovery Framework and SecureQEMU. Kimball has spoken at BlackHat, ISSA, Ohio Information Security Group,

## Brian Krumheuer

### QuietRIATT: Rebuilding the Import Address Table Using Hooked DLL Calls

For a Reverse Engineer, rebuilding a large Import Address Table (IAT) can
be a very time-consuming and tedious process. When the IAT has been
sufficiently hashed and current IAT rebuilders fail to resolve any of the calls,
there is little other choice than to rebuild it by hand. Depending on the size,
it can take days or even weeks. Also, doing anything by hand is prone to
mistakes.

QuietRIATT is an IDA Pro plug-in which automates the process of rebuilding
the IAT when it canât be done by current IAT tools. Not only can it greatly
reduce the amount of time spent rebuilding by hand, it also removes the element
of human error.

Brian Krumheuer is a Reverse Engineer for the Software Security Team at Riverside Research Institute. He worked for over eight years in IT and Software Development before entering the field of Reverse Engineering. Currently, he plays a vital role on the team by developing many ring-3 and ring-0 reverse engineering tools for both Windows and Linux. He has also helped create an instructional course on Reverse Engineering.

Jason Raber serves as the technical lead for the Riverside Research Institute Red Team which provides government and commercial entities with specialized software security support. Focus areas include:Reverse Engineering:Specializes in extracting intellectual property from a broad spectrum of software. This includes user applications, DLLs, drivers, OS kernels, and firmware. The software can be based on a variety of platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac/Embedded etc). Malware/Virus/RootKit Analysis:Identifies and analyzes intrusion software to characterize and/or neutralize the threat. Jason has spent 8 years in the world of reverse engineering, preceded by 5 years working at Texas Instruments developing Compiler tools for DSPs (code generators, assemblers, linkers, disassemblers, etc). Developing C compilers for 5 years prior to reverse engineering has provided a good foundation for understanding machine language and hardware to be utilized in reverse engineering tasks.

## Adam Laurie

### Satellite Hacking for Fun and Profit

Ever wondered just how much data and how many services are being beamed down at you from space right now? We all know there are thousands
of channels out there, but how can we make sense of them all? How can we find the stuff "they" don't want us to know about? Is there any
such stuff? What can we do with it once we've found it? Will we go blind, like mother told us?

Adam Laurie Adam Laurie is a freelance security consultant working the in the field of electronic communications. He started in the computer industry in the late Seventies, working as a computer programmer on PDP-8 and other mini computers, and then on various Unix, Dos and CP/M based micro computers as they emerged in the Eighties. He quickly became interested in the underlying network and data protocols, and moved his attention to those areas and away from programming, starting a data conversion company which rapidly grew to become Europe's largest specialist in that field (A.L. downloading Services). During this period, he successfully disproved the industry lie that music CDs could not be read by computers, and, with help from his brother Ben, wrote the world's first CD ripper, 'CDGRAB'. At this point, he and Ben became interested in the newly emerging concept of 'The Internet', and were involved in various early open source projects, the most well known of which is probably their ownâ'Apache-SSL'âwhich went on to become the de-facto standard secure web server. Since the late Nineties they have focused their attention on security, and have been the authors of various papers exposing flaws in Internet services and/or software, as well as pioneering the concept of re-using military data centres (housed in underground nuclear bunkers) as secure hosting facilities. Adam has been a senior member of staff at DEFCON since 1997, and also acted as a member of staff during the early years of the Black Hat Briefings, and is a member of the Bluetooth SIG Security Experts Group and speaks regularly on the international conference circuit on matters concerning Bluetooth security. He has also given presentations on forensics, magnetic stripe technology, InfraRed and RFID. He is the author and maintainer of the open source python RFID exploration library 'RFIDIOt', which can be found at [http://rfidiot.org.](http://rfidiot.org)

### Making Privacy-Preserving Data Mining Practical with Smartcards

Data mining provides large benefits to the commercial, government and homeland security sectors, but the aggregation and storage of huge amounts of data about
citizens inevitably leads to erosion of privacy. To achieve the benefits that data mining has to offer, while at the same time enhancing privacy, we need
technological solutions that simultaneously enable data mining while preserving privacy. This need has been recognized by the US government, as can be seen
in the February 2008 [report](http://www.dni.gov/reports/data_mining_report_feb08.pdf) on data mining by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (see pages 9-12).
In this presentation, we demonstrate surprisingly simple and extraordinarily efficient protocols for a number of non-trivial tasks related to privacy-preserving data mining.
Our protocols use standard smartcards and standard smartcard infrastructure, and are the first truly practical solutions for these problems that provide strong security guarantees.

Andrew Lindell is the Chief Cryptographer at Aladdin Knowledge Systems and an Assistant Professor at Bar-Ilan University in Israel.
Andrew attained a Ph.D. at the Weizmann Institute of Science in 2002 and spent two years at the IBM T.J.Watson research lab as a Postdoctoral fellow in the
cryptography research group. Andrew has carried out extensive research in cryptography, and has published more than 50 conference and journal publications,
as well as an undergraduate textbook on cryptography and a book detailing secure protocols. Andrew has presented at numerous international conferences, workshops
and university seminars, and has served on program committees for top international conferences in cryptography. In addition to Andrew's notable academic experience,
he joined Aladdin Knowledge Systems in 2004. In his position as Chief Cryptographer, he has worked on the cryptographic and security issues that arise in the design
and construction of authentication schemes, smartcard applications, software protection schemes and more. Offering a unique combination of academic and industry experience,
Andrew brings a fresh and insightful perspective on many of the crucial security issues that arise today.

## David Litchfield

### The Forensic Investigation of a Compromised Oracle Database Server

Database Forensics expert David Litchfield will discuss his new tool and paper. The tool, orablock, allows a forensic investigator to dump data from a "cold" Oracle data file - i.e. there's no need
to load up the data file in the database which would cause the data file to be modified, so using orablock preserves the evidence. Orablock can
also be used to locate "stale" data - i.e. data that has been deleted or updated. It can also be used to dump SCNs for data blocks which can be
useful during the examination of a compromised Oracle box.

David Litchfield specializes in searching for new threats to database systems and web applications. He has lectured to both
British and U.S. government security agencies on database security and is a regular speaker at the Blackhat Security Briefings. He is a co-author of "The
Database Hacker's Handbook", "The Shellcoder's Handbook", "SQL Server Security", and "Special Ops". In his spare time he is the Chief Scientist of Next
Generation Security Software Ltd.

## Moxie Marlinspike

### New Techniques for Defeating SSL/TLS

This presentation will demonstrate some new tools and techniques that
allow attackers to silently alter, inject, and log traffic intended for
secure transmission by SSL/TLS in common web applications such as online
banking or secure webmail logins. It builds off of the SSL exploit
tools and research on the failure of browsers to validate
BasicConstraints that I published in 2002, and will include
demonstrations of a new tool for exploiting current use patterns as well
as some data gathered from field testing in the real world.

Moxie Marlinspike has shied away
from the professional security
community since its emergence, and tends to hang out with the wrong
crowd instead. He's a fellow at the Hack The Planet Institute of
Pittsburgh, and in his spare time he rides freight trains across the

### Windows Vista Security Internals

This presentation will describe in detail some of the specific changes in
Windows Vista's security internals. Focus is on actual security modules and
functions relevant to authentication, passwords, network communications and
IPSec enhancements. The primary purpose of this presentation is to provide the
audience with an overview of what these changes entail, the knowledge necessary
to modify existing or craft new tools, and to explore and understand the risks
present within the new security architecture. Potential areas of vulnerability
will be presented and discussed in detail. These changes were primarily
discovered through a lot of research, security testing and reverse engineering
tasks and will be presented in this context. This talk is NOT about DEP, ASLR
and other enhancements in Vista that have already been adequately covered
elsewhere. The main benefits of application of this knowledge will fall into the
post-exploitation arena.

Michael Muckin is the Team Lead for the Lockheed Martin Security Engineering Test Team where he regularly performs
penetration tests, vuln research, reverse engineering, product assessments and other various security tasks. Prior to LM, Michael worked at Foundstone
as a Managing Principal Consultant and at Microsoft as a Security Services Specialist for the Enterprise Services group.

### Your Face Is NOT Your Password

Biometrics has nowadays been of universal interest and has been developed and
used for many purposes such as for the detection of criminals and undesirables,
identification and access control. Within this paper, we would like to concern
about Facial Cognitive Biometric Systems and their application in User
Authentication Based on Face Recognition.

Lenovo, Asus, and Toshiba are known as the first three big computer
manufacturers to put that technology into practical use and to bring about
greater convenience for their customers. The one question to ask is whether such
technology is really safe and secure for its users to enjoy.

My research, which is concluded in this paper, will prove that the mechanisms
used by those three vendors havenât met the security requirements needed by an
authentication system and that they cannot wholly protected their users from
being tampered.

Mr. Duc Nguyen is senior researcher of Bkis. He is the manager of the Application Security Department. He also takes part in developing
Bkav Anti-Virus and Bkav Firewall, the most well-known security software in Vietnam. His responsibilities cover both technical and management aspects of
studies on network security and security vulnerability research. He is also an instructor of Bkis Security Training Course for Banks, ISPs... in Vietnam./p>

### **Alternate:** Transparent Emergency Data Destruction

Transparent Emergency Data Destruction allows a user to destroy information quickly and discreetely when facing an adversary.
When the computer is booted, the user will be prompted for a password. In the event of an emergency, the user can enter a duress password,
which will render their data inaccessible before booting to a discreet desktop environment.

The proof of concept is done in Ubuntu Linux. It uses a standard full disk encryption utility, a read-only installation of the basic
operating system, and modified boot scripts. The time spent destroying data is negligible compared to the time it takes to boot the operating
system, and the performance penalties during operation are minor.

Warren Roberts is a research scientist with the Institute for Information Security (ISEC) at the University of Tulsa. He started out with ISEC's research into Risk-Adaptive Access Control, but has moved on to spear-head the research into Transparent Emergency Data Destruction.

### Snort My Memory

For almost a decade Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been a
critical technology used by network security professionals to identify attacks
against their infrastructure. There are numerous sources producing signatures
for the latest malware outbreak or âPatch Tuesdayâ exploit. In many
circumstances, these network-based indicators exist in host memory and can be
detected using the same signatures that are used in NIDS products. This
presentation introduces a method for using these network-based signatures to
identify hosts with malware or shellcode present using memory forensic analysis
techniques. The benefits of using snort signatures in memory are: malware may
not have sent the strings over the network yet; and malware that encrypts
strings over the network may have decrypted strings in memory prior to calling
into some encryption library. The talk concludes with the introduction of
MindSniffer, a new tool that converts a Snort IDS signature to a Memoryzeâ¢
filter. The demo uses existing signatures, converts them to filters and shows
how these filters can identify malware or potential shellcode in live system
memory or acquired memory images.

Peter Silberman works at MANDIANT on the product development team. For a number of years, Peter has specialized
in offensive and defensive kernel technologies, reverse engineering, and vulnerability discovery. He enjoys automating solutions to problems both

### Dissecting Web Attacks

Attackers have been increasingly using the web and client side attacks in order to steal information from targets. Some of the more interesting
and wide spread attacks seem to be originating from countries like China and Russia. This talk will describe some of these attacks in detail including
how they are achieving large numbers of penetrations, their web infrastructures and some of the mistakes they have made which have allowed us to track
them back further. This information will provide some evidence as to where these attacks are truly originating from and what their purposes are.

Val Smith has been involved in the computer security community and industry for over ten years. He currently
works as a professional security researcher on a variety of problems in the security community. He specializes in penetration testing (over 40,000 machines assessed),
reverse engineering and malware research. He works on the Metasploit Project development team as well as other vulnerability development efforts. Most recently
Valsmith founded Attack Research which is devoted to deep understanding of the mechanics of computer attack. Previously Valsmith founded Offensive Computing,
a public, open source malware research project.

Colin Ames is a security researcher with Attack Research LLC where he consults for both the private and public
sectors. He's currently focused on Pen testing, Exploit Development, Reverse Engineering, and Malware Analysis.

### A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: The Dangers of Persistent Web Browser Storage

As the line between desktop and web applications becomes increasingly blurry
in a web 2.0 world, browser functionality is being pushed well beyond what it
was originally intended for. Persistent client side storage has become a
requirement for web applications if they are to be available both online and
off. This need is being filled by a variety of technologies such as persistent
cookies, Flash storage and Google Gears. While all such technologies offer great
promise, it is clear that the vast majority of developers simply do not
understand their security implications.

Researching a variety of currently deployed implementations of these
technologies has revealed a broad scope of vulnerabilities with frightening
implications. Now attackers can target victims not just once, but every time
they visit a site as the victim now carries and stores the attack with them.
Imagine a scenario whereby updated confidential information is forwarded to an
attacker every time a victim interacts with a given we application. The attacker
no longer needs to worry about timing their attacks to ensure that the victim is
authenticated as the victim attacks himself! Limited storage? Cookies that
expire? Not a problem when entire databases are accessible with virtually
unlimited storage and an infinite lifespan. Think these attacks are theoretical?
Think again. In this talk we dive into these technologies and break down the
risk posed by them when not properly understood. We will then detail a variety
of real-world vulnerabilities that have been uncovered, including a new class of
cross-site scripting.

### Defending Your DNS in a Post-Kaminsky World

The Kaminsky bug sent everyone scrambling to fix their DNS. Or did it? While
nearly all of the big DNS providers have taken measures, most of the smaller
players are still vulnerable. People are afraid to make changes to their DNS
infrastructure, and although the world is moving towards DNSSEC, that will not
be reality for at least another two years.

Contrary to popular belief, the IETF is not leaving people in the dark
until they adopt DNSSEC. It has come up with some viable workarounds that can be
deployed. This presentation will teach the counter measures that can be taken
with minimal changes to currently deployed DNS infrastructure. And heck, we'll
even explain Bernstein's dnscurve.

Paul Wouters is often involved with cryptography, digital rights and cypherpunk projects. He co-founded "Xtended Internet", one
of the first the Dutch ISP's back in 1996. In 2003 he co-founded Xelerance, a company specialised in VPN technology that develops and maintains "Openswan", the Linux IPsec software.
He has been involved with the deployment of DNSSEC worldwide, and is an active IETF and RIPE contributor. In 2006 he published "Building and integrating Virtual Private Networks with
Openswan". He currently maintains various cryptographic software and DNS related packages for Red Hat's Fedora and RHEL Linux, including the popular Instant Messenger encryption
software "Off the Record". If not travelling, he can regularly be found at Toronto's HackLab collective.

### **Alternate**: Masibty: A Web Application Firewall Based on Anomaly Detection

During this talk we will focus on why current web application firewalls and IPSs are basically useless, since they are misuse based (e.g. rely on rules). Since misuse
detectors are unable to keep up with evolving attack schemes, evasion techniques, and custom applications, better anomaly detectors are badly needed. Masibty is an anomaly
detection reverse proxy, aimed at detecting web application attacks. It is able to detect zero-day attacks (the real thing, not a marketing-tainted redefinition) after an
initial live training which does not require attack-free data. Modularized for easy extension, in its current implementation it is able to detect and block anomalies in the
DOM tree - therefore blocking XSS attacks - and in application parameters. It is resilient to URL rewriting, and it was tested against in-the-wild exploits collected from
the usual sources over a number of months, with the use of various forms of evasion.

 Stefano Zanero received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from the Politecnico of Milano technical university, where he
is an Assistant Professor. His current research interests include the development of Intrusion Detection Systems based on unsupervised learning algorithms, security of web
applications and computer virology. He has been a speaker at international scientific and technical conferences, and he is the author and co-author of books and articles
published in international, peer reviewed journals and conferences. He is a member of the board of the "Journal in Computer Virology", and acts as a reviewer for the "ACM
Computing Reviews" and "IEEE Security&Privacy", as well as various primary international conferences. He is a member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers), the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), and a founding member of the Italian Chapter of ISSA (Information Systems Security Association), for which he
sits in the International Board of Directors. He has also been a columnist for Computer World Italy, and has been awarded a journalism award in 2003. Since 2004 he is a
partner and CTO of Secure Network, a firm specializing in information security training and consulting, based in Milan.

### Defending Against BGP Man-In-The-Middle Attacks

At DEFCON 16, Alex Pilosov and Tony Kapela presented a new BGP attack in
which traffic to a victim is hijacked, but then transparently routed to the
intended recipient. This allows for wholesale eavesdropping, including
alteration, of all incoming traffic to the victim. In this talk, we review
enough BGP routing background to understand the threat and how it breaks the
trust model inherent in Internet routing. Then we review possible detection
mechanisms via data aggregation from global route collection. The tip-off to
such attacks includes prefix de-aggregation, invalid originations, invalid AS
adjacencies, and even improbable AS paths. Detection techniques depend whether
or not you know ground truth, i.e., if you are looking to defend your own
network or simply observe such hijacks in the wild. We conclude with case
studies of applying these techniques to global routing data.

Earl Zmijewski is responsible for all of Renesys's Internet Data
software, services and operations. He has over 20 years of experience
encompassing scientific computing and most areas of IT, with particular
emphasis on networking and security. Before Renesys, Earl spent over 12
