Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to Intel's Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), although the specific CVE is not mentioned explicitly:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of:
1.  **Implementation Flaws:**  The researchers found several implementation flaws in Intel's system software related to TXT, which allowed for a "stage-one attack."
2.  **Design Decision:**  A design decision in the current TXT release enabled a "stage-two attack." This suggests a weakness in the design or assumptions made in the current TXT specification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Implementation Flaws:** These are coding errors or oversights in the system software that handles TXT.
*   **Design Flaw:** A vulnerability stemming from a design choice in the TXT architecture. This is not a coding error, but a problem in how the system is designed to work.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Bypass Trusted Boot Process:** The primary impact is the ability to bypass the trusted boot process implemented by Intel's tboot, which is a reference implementation of a TXT-based system loader. By bypassing this process, the attacker can load a malicious OS kernel or VMM instead of the intended secure one.
*   **Compromise Integrity:** The ability to bypass the trusted boot process would allow an attacker to introduce persistent system-level malware, such as OS kernel modifications and potentially bypass any security mechanisms provided by the TXT.
*   **Undermine Trust:** The core goal of TXT is to establish trust in the system software being loaded, and these attacks directly undermine this.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack is described as a two-stage process:
1.  **Stage One:** Exploiting implementation flaws in Intel's TXT system software.
2.  **Stage Two:** Exploiting a design decision in the current TXT release, indicating a weakness that can be leveraged after a first stage compromise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Initial Access:** The attacker needs some initial access to the system to exploit the implementation flaw (Stage One). The blog post suggests that the attacker could have some prior rootkit installed in the system, since TXT was designed to mitigate such threats.
*   **Technical Expertise:**  The attack requires a deep understanding of TXT architecture, its implementation in tboot, and system-level software exploitation techniques.
*   **Knowledge of the Flaw:**  The attacker needs to be aware of the specific implementation flaws and design weakness in the Intel TXT implementation.

**Additional Details:**
*   **tboot:** The exploit targets tboot, Intel's implementation of a TXT-based system loader, used in conjunction with Xen hypervisor.
*   **Late Launch:** TXT provides a "late launch" capability using the SENTER CPU instruction to load the OS kernel or VMM in a secure way, after a system might have been compromised (boot sector viruses or BIOS rootkits). This attack undermines that capability.
*   **Intel's Response:** Intel was informed of the flaws and design weakness and is working on fixes. They also intend to provide developers with an updated TXT specification that addresses the vulnerability to stage-two attacks.

**CVE Relevance:**
While the specific CVE is not referenced in the text, the information provided directly addresses known vulnerabilities in Intel's TXT which are of the same nature as CVE-2009-0066.

**Conclusion**
The content provides significant details about vulnerabilities in Intel TXT, specifically implementation flaws and a design decision weakness that allow bypassing the secure boot process and compromising the integrity of the system. It describes a practical exploit against tboot that is relevant to CVE-2009-0066.
