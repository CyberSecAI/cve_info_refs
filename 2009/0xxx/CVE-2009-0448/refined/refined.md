```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include local files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution if sensitive files or scripts are included.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the 'synTarget' GET parameter in the 'preview.php' script.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable script.
