This document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting various Oracle products, which are addressed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2009. While the document does not provide specific details about each vulnerability, it does describe the general nature of the vulnerabilities and their potential impact.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document does not specify root causes for individual vulnerabilities. It generally refers to multiple vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist across a range of Oracle products, including Oracle Database, Application Server, Outside In SDK, XML Publisher, BI Publisher, E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, WebLogic Server, Data Service Integrator, and JRockit. These vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
   - Remote execution of arbitrary code or commands.
   - Information disclosure (access to sensitive information).
   - Denial of service (making the system unavailable).
   - An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** Vulnerable components may be accessible to unauthenticated, remote attackers. This indicates a network-based attack vector, where an attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities remotely, without needing prior authentication to the vulnerable components. The document suggests that network access to the vulnerable Oracle services is sufficient for an attack.

The document provides more detail than the official CVE description by listing specific vulnerable products and versions.
