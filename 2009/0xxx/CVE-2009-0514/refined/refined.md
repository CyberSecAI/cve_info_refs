{
  "Root cause": "The webframe 0.76 application has multiple file inclusion vulnerabilities due to insecure handling of include statements.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) via the 'currentmod' and 'LANG' parameters in /mod/index.php",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) via the 'classFiles' parameter in /mod/admin/doc/index.php, /mod/index.php, and /mod/base/menu.php"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the local file system (LFI) or from a remote server (RFI), potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests with crafted 'classFiles', 'currentmod' or 'LANG' parameters."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No authentication required."
