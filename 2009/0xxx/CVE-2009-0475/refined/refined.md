- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer underflow during Huffman decoding leads to improper bounds checking when writing to a heap-allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer underflow, improper bounds checking, heap corruption
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unexpected process termination or, potentially, arbitrary code execution due to heap corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Decoding a specially crafted MP3 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to provide the crafted MP3 file to be decoded by a vulnerable OpenCORE implementation.
