[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0377)

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix several security issues are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
contains the software and tools that users need to run applications written
using the Java programming language.

A flaw was found in the way that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handled
temporary font files. A malicious applet could use this flaw to use large
amounts of disk space, causing a denial of service. (CVE-2006-2426)

A memory leak flaw was found in LittleCMS (embedded in OpenJDK). An
application using color profiles could use excessive amounts of memory, and
possibly crash after using all available memory, if used to open
specially-crafted images. (CVE-2009-0581)

Multiple integer overflow flaws which could lead to heap-based buffer
overflows, as well as multiple insufficient input validation flaws, were
found in the way LittleCMS handled color profiles. An attacker could use
these flaws to create a specially-crafted image file which could cause a
Java application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when opened.
(CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733)

A null pointer dereference flaw was found in LittleCMS. An application
using color profiles could crash while converting a specially-crafted image
file. (CVE-2009-0793)

A flaw in the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) service endpoint
handling could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service on the
server application hosting the JAX-WS service endpoint. (CVE-2009-1101)

A flaw in the way the Java Runtime Environment initialized LDAP connections
could allow a remote, authenticated user to cause a denial of service on
the LDAP service. (CVE-2009-1093)

A flaw in the Java Runtime Environment LDAP client could allow malicious
data from an LDAP server to cause arbitrary code to be loaded and then run
on an LDAP client. (CVE-2009-1094)

Several buffer overflow flaws were found in the Java Runtime Environment
unpack200 functionality. An untrusted applet could extend its privileges,
allowing it to read and write local files, as well as to execute local
applications with the privileges of the user running the applet.
(CVE-2009-1095, CVE-2009-1096)

A flaw in the Java Runtime Environment Virtual Machine code generation
functionality could allow untrusted applets to extend their privileges. An
untrusted applet could extend its privileges, allowing it to read and write
local files, as well as execute local applications with the privileges
of the user running the applet. (CVE-2009-1102)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the splash screen processing. A remote
attacker could extend privileges to read and write local files, as well as
to execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the
java process. (CVE-2009-1097)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in how GIF images were processed. A remote
attacker could extend privileges to read and write local files, as well as
execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the
java process. (CVE-2009-1098)

Note: The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-1095,
CVE-2009-1096, and CVE-2009-1102, can only be triggered in
java-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the "appletviewer" application.

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use

Package        : openjdk-6
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2006-2426 CVE-2009-0581 CVE-2009-0723 CVE-2009-0733 CVE-2009-0793 CVE-2009-1093 CVE-2009-1094 CVE-2009-1095 CVE-2009-1096 CVE-2009-1097 CVE-2009-1098 CVE-2009-1101

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java SE platform.

Creation of large, temporary fonts could use up available disk space,
leading to a denial of service condition (CVE-2006-2426).

Several vulnerabilities existed in the embedded LittleCMS library,
exploitable through crafted images: a memory leak, resulting in a
denial of service condition (CVE-2009-0581), heap-based buffer
overflows, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution
(CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0733), and a null-pointer dereference,
leading to denial of service (CVE-2009-0793).

The LDAP server implementation (in com.sun.jdni.ldap) did not properly
close sockets if an error was encountered, leading to a
denial-of-service condition (CVE-2009-1093).

The LDAP client implementation (in com.sun.jdni.ldap) allowed
malicious LDAP servers to execute arbitrary code on the client
(CVE-2009-1094).

The HTTP server implementation (sun.net.httpserver) contained an
unspecified denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2009-1101).

Several issues in Java Web Start have been addressed (CVE-2009-1095,
CVE-2009-1096, CVE-2009-1097, CVE-2009-1098).  The Debian packages
currently do not support Java Web Start, so these issues are not
directly exploitable, but the relevant code has been updated
nevertheless.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1+lenny2.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## Details

Chris Evans discovered that LittleCMS did not properly handle certain error

conditions, resulting in a large memory leak. If a user or automated system

were tricked into processing an image with malicious ICC tags, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-0581](/security/CVE-2009-0581))

Chris Evans discovered that LittleCMS contained multiple integer overflows.

If a user or automated system were tricked into processing an image with

malicious ICC tags, a remote attacker could crash applications linked

against liblcms1, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-0723](/security/CVE-2009-0723))

Chris Evans discovered that LittleCMS did not properly perform bounds

checking, leading to a buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were

tricked into processing an image with malicious ICC tags, a remote attacker

could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-0733](/security/CVE-2009-0733))

### LittleCMS vulnerabilities

Today, vendor updates should be flowing for vulnerabilities in LittleCMS, sometimes known just as "lcms" or "liblcms". LittleCMS is a very useful open-source colour profile parsing and conversion tool. Some technical details of the various vulnerabilities (stack-based buffer overflows, integer overflows, etc). are given here:

<http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2009-003.html>

The most interesting thing about LittleCMS is how quickly it has become a very critical building block for UNIX desktops. Let's enumerate some of the pieces of software impacted by any lcms vulnerabilities:

* **OpenJDK**. OpenJDK uses lcms to parse colour profiles embedded in JPEG or BMP files. OpenJDK is on the default browser attack surface of a lot of Linux installations, e.g. Fedora 10.

* **Firefox**. Firefox 3.1beta uses lcms to parse colour profiles embedded in JPEG files -- by default. (Firefox 3.0 has this ability but not by default, so thankfully this can be addressed before 3.1 goes production).

* **GIMP**. GIMP uses the system liblcms library to parse colour profiles embedded in at least JPEG files.

I don't usually do this, but I took the trouble to write an exploit for one of the bugs, because it was fun and had some quirks. It's probably not a great idea to release it just yet -- look for a separate blog post soon.

Finally, some notes on the various Linux system protections that do or don't help defend against the exploit for this stack-based buffer overflow:

* My exploit targets, *but is not limited to*, systems with executable heaps. Interestingly 32-bit Ubuntu 8.10 on my laptop shows the heap as non-executable in `/proc/<pid>/maps`, but it lies because the installed kernel is non-PAE.

* For systems with non-executable heaps, such as 64-bit Ubuntu 8.10 on my desktop, an exploit is still possible because you can point registers other than `rip` into the heap (e.g. `rbp`). I've not written this exploit.

* Systems with stack smashing detection, such as Fedora 10, do make the exploit hard or impossible. However, the somewhat risky OpenJDK package on such a system is *not* compiled with stack smashing detection, leaving the default browsing experience vulnerable.

* I noticed that the Fedora 10 stack smashing detection does not exit cleanly, but gives a SIGSEGV. On 32-bit, the faulting instruction is `cmpw $0xb858,(%eax)` where `%eax == 0x1`. Stack frames is `__stack_chk_fail __fortify_fail __libc_message backtrace _Unwind_Backtrace ??`. Leave a comment if you know what's going on. Sounds dangerous to me.

Aside from stack smashing, I'd be interested in seeing the exploit run on Fedora 10 with and without SELinux in enforcing. More traditional stack smashing relies on an executable stack, which SELinux plays a direct role in mitigating (orthognal to ASLR/PIE/et al).

However, you could still leverage the ret2{libc,etc} vectors....

Sounds like Fedora also messes with glibc's handling of stack-smashes.
Or maybe it is Ubuntu (since it seems those are the systems you diff between).
I know the hardened gentoo project wrote their own code [1] for those terminations becouse they thought the original one in glibc did not do a good enought.

You may want to look into that in this case.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### LCMS (Little CMS / LittleCMS) memory corruptions

---

Programs affected: lcms, Firefox, OpenJDK, lcms consumers (GIMP, etc).

Fixed: lcms-1.18beta2

Severity: Arbitrarty code execution from remote.

CVE-2009-0723: integer overflows leading to buffer overflows.

CVE-2009-0581: large memory leak.

CVE-2009-0733: stack-based buffer overflow due to missing bounds check.LittleCMS is used for colour correction and management in several critical
pieces of software. It is typical for this software to look inside JPEG files
for ICC profiles, and feed them through LittleCMS if found. Therefore,
opening or viewing a malicious JPEG can compromise your machine via
affected software.The OpenJDK case is arguably the most critical because it can be abused directly
on the server side to take over servers. All it needs is an application that
parses untrusted JPEG files (e.g. to thumbnail them).It is against this same threat that the memory leak is significant: taking down
server JVMs.In addition, OpenJDK of course backs the Java appletviewer on modern Linux
desktops, so this could be abused to take over web client machines.Furthermore, it's interesting to note that the OpenJDK package is often built
without many of the system defenses that would mitigate this bug - e.g. the
stack is often forced executable, and stack canaries / protection are disabled
for whatever reason.The Firefox case is fortunately not as severe as it could be. Firefox 3.0 does
not parse embedded ICC profiles in the default configuration. Firefox 3.1 has
changed to parse them by default, so it's nice to get these bugs fixed before
3.1 goes production and gets widely deployed.The code responsible for the most severe bug, CVE-2009-0733, looks like this:
```

static
LCMSBOOL ReadSetOfCurves(LPLCMSICCPROFILE Icc, size_t Offset, LPLUT NewLUT, int nLocation)
{
    LPGAMMATABLE Curves[MAXCHANNELS];
    unsigned int i, nCurves;

    if (Icc -> Seek(Icc, Offset)) return FALSE;

    if (nLocation == 1 ||  nLocation == 3)

        nCurves = NewLUT ->InputChan;
    else
        nCurves = NewLUT ->OutputChan;

    for (i=0; i < nCurves; i++) {

        Curves[i] = ReadCurve(Icc);
...

```
Where `MAXCHANNELS` is `16`. However, the overflow is not
as obvious / clear cut as the above code might suggest. Some common code paths
place an upper bound on `InputChan` and `OutputChan`.
However, `ReadLUT_A2B` and `ReadLUT_B2A` do not, e.g.:
```

static
LCMSBOOL ReadLUT_A2B(LPLCMSICCPROFILE Icc, LPLUT NewLUT, size_t BaseOffset, icTagSignature sig)
{
    icLutAtoB LUT16;

       if (Icc ->Read(&LUT16, sizeof(icLutAtoB), 1, Icc) != 1) return FALSE;

       NewLUT -> InputChan     = LUT16.inputChan;
       NewLUT -> OutputChan    = LUT16.outputChan;
...
       if (LUT16.offsetB != 0)
                ReadSetOfCurves(Icc, BaseOffset + LUT16.offsetB, NewLUT, 2);
...

```
### Exploitation

I don't usually exploit bugs, but there are nice subtleties here to exploit
this, so I'll post a demo exploit to my blog, with explanation, over the next
few days.
### Credits

* Google - found on Google's paid time.
* oCERT (and particularly Andrea Barisani) for co-ordinating a tricky issue.
* Tomas Hoger (RedHat) for fixing up serious issues with the integer overflow detection.
* Josh Bressers (RedHat) for preventing div-by-zero errors making it into the final patch.
* Marti Maria (lcms maintainer) for being patient with multiple incremental patches.
* Jan Lieskovsky (RedHat) for help co-ordinating and expanding investigation to other open-source packages.
* Julien Tinnes for interesting discussions regarding executability of
  heaps.

Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2009-0581 CVE-2009-0723 CVE-2009-0733

Several security issues have been discovered in lcms, a color management
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-0581

Chris Evans discovered that lcms is affected by a memory leak, which
could result in a denial of service via specially crafted image files.

CVE-2009-0723

Chris Evans discovered that lcms is prone to several integer overflows
via specially crafted image files, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-0733

Chris Evans discovered the lack of upper-gounds check on sizes leading
to a buffer overflow, which could be used to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.dfsg-1+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.15-1.1+etch2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# LittleCMS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200904-19**

Multiple errors in LittleCMS allow for attacks including the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/lcms** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.18-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.18-r1** |

### Background

LittleCMS, or short lcms, is a color management system for working with
ICC profiles. It is used by many applications including GIMP and
Firefox.

### Description

RedHat reported a null-pointer dereference flaw while processing
monochrome ICC profiles (CVE-2009-0793).

Chris Evans of Google discovered the following vulnerabilities:

* LittleCMS contains severe memory leaks (CVE-2009-0581).
* LittleCMS is prone to multiple integer overflows, leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-0723).
* The
  ReadSetOfCurves() function is vulnerable to stack-based buffer
  overflows when called from code paths without a bounds check on channel
  counts (CVE-2009-0733).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted file containing a malicious ICC profile, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application or memory exhaustion, leading to a Denial
of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LittleCMS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/lcms-1.18-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- vim, gvim
The VI Improved editor (vim) was prone to several security problems:
CVE-2008-4677: The netrw plugin sent credentials to all servers.
CVE-2008-2712: Arbitrary code execution in vim helper plugins
filetype, zip, xpm, gzip and netrw.
CVE-2008-3074: tarplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3075: zipplugin code injection
CVE-2008-3076: several netrw bugs, code injection
CVE-2008-6235: code injection in the netrw plugin
CVE-2008-4677: credential disclosure by netrw plugin
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
On openSUSE vim was upgraded to version 7.2.108 to fix those issues.
SLES9 and 10 were only affected by a subset, patches were backported
to fix the problems.
- apache2
A DoS condition in apache2's mod\_proxy has been fixed
(CVE-2008-2364).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3
- opera
Opera 9.64 is a recommended security and stability upgrade,
incorporating the Opera Presto 2.1.1 user agent engine. Opera highly
recommends all users to upgrade to Opera 9.64 to take advantage of
these improvements (CVE-2009-0914, CVE-2009-0915, CVE-2009-0916).
A detailed changelog can be found at
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/964/>
- multipath tools
/var/run/multipathd.sock was world-writable allowing local users to
issue commands to the multipath daemon (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES10
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in the
lcms library contained in openjdk. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to crash applications using lcms or even execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723, CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Previous update packages contained broken dependencies and couldn't
be installed. Therefore the update had to be re-released.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- imp
Version update to IMP 4.1.6 fixes a problem with validating HTTP requests that
allowed attackers to delete emails (CVE-2007-6018) and some
cross-site-scripting issues (CVE-2009-0930).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- horde
Version update to horde 3.1.9 fixes a cross-site-scripting (XSS) issue
(CVE-2008-5917) and an include file problem (CVE-2009-0932).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- lcms
Specially crafted image files could cause an integer overflow in
lcms. Attackers could potentially exploit that to crash applications
using lcms or even execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0723,
CVE-2009-0581, CVE-2009-0733).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLES10
- moodle
moodle was prone to several cross-site-scripting (XSS) and
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) problems (CVE-2009-0499, CVE-2009-0500,
CVE-2009-0501, CVE-2009-0502).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ghostscript
Integer overflows and missing upper bounds checks in Ghostscript's
ICC library potentially allowed attackers to crash Ghostscript or
even cause execution of arbitrary code via specially crafted PS or
PDF files (CVE-2009-0583, CVE-2009-0584).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLES9, SLES10
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- NetworkManager
The NetworkManager update caused WLAN to stop working on some
systems. Those systems most likely have a stale directory
/var/run/dbus/at\_console/root. It's most likely a leftover from a
root session. Removing the directory and restarting networking
should fix the problems. Please avoid logging in as root in the future.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
