  "cveId": "CVE-2009-0547",
  "description": "Evolution 2.22.3.1 checks S/MIME signatures against a copy of the e-mail text within a signed-data blob, not the copy of the e-mail text displayed to the user, which allows remote attackers to spoof a signature by modifying the latter copy, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5077.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Evolution checks S/MIME signatures against a copy of the email within a signed data blob, instead of the copy displayed to the user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of cryptographic signature",
      "Mishandling of S/MIME signatures"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can modify email content while preserving what appears to be a valid signature, leading to potential spoofing attacks and a loss of data integrity.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack"
     ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs to intercept or otherwise alter an S/MIME signed email message. The attacker needs to be able to modify the displayed copy of the email. The attacker doesn't need knowledge of private keys as this is a logic error."
  },
  "relatedCves": [
    "CVE-2008-5077"
  ],
  "additionalNotes": "This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2008-5077 but has a different root cause and attack vector. Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability lies in the S/MIME signature verification process in Evolution. Several sources note this bug has a CVSS v2 score of 5.0, except one that noted 7.5 for a buffer overflow in an adjacent vulnerability"
