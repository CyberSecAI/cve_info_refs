Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0550:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is in the way Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) and Windows Internet (WinINet) APIs handle NTLM credentials. Specifically, WinHTTP and WinINet do not properly opt into NTLM credential-reflection protections. This improper handling allows an attacker to potentially replay a user's credentials to a service on the user's client that accepts NTLM authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Credential Reflection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to capture and reuse a user's NTLM credentials. This is because of the improper implementation of NTLM credential-reflection protections.
*   **Lack of Proper NTLM Protection:** The vulnerability stems from the failure of the WinHTTP/WinINet APIs to ensure proper NTLM credential protection mechanisms are used, thus making them vulnerable to credential replay attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit can lead to remote code execution on an affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights. This allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **User Privilege Gain:** An attacker can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web-based attacks:** An attacker can host a malicious website that captures the user's NTLM credentials and replays them to the client.
*   **Compromised websites:** An attacker can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that host user-generated content, which would exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture NTLM credentials from an HTTP request.
*  **SMB Traffic:** An attacker can replay captured credentials to a service on the user's client that accepts NTLM authentication. The most common attack vector would be through SMB.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
*   **Web server hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious Web site or compromise an existing site to deliver the malicious content.
*   **NTLM Authentication:** The target client must have a service running that accepts NTLM authentication
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious Web site or interact with malicious content (e.g., clicking a link).
*   **Capture User Credentials:** An attacker must be able to capture the user's NTLM login credentials

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability affects both WinINet (used by Internet Explorer) and Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) and was addressed by patches in MS09-013 and MS09-014.
*   Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 have the firewall set to "public" by default, which reduces the exposure, as the firewall blocks SMB traffic, but the vulnerability still exists when not on a public profile.
*   This vulnerability was publicly disclosed before the release of the patch.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability when the bulletin was first published.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2009-0050
