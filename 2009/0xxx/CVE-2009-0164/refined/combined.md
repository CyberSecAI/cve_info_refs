How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CUPS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200904-20**

Multiple errors in CUPS might allow for the remote execution of arbitrary
code or DNS rebinding attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/cups** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.10** |

### Background

CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, is a full-featured print server.

### Description

The following issues were reported in CUPS:

* iDefense
  reported an integer overflow in the \_cupsImageReadTIFF() function in
  the "imagetops" filter, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2009-0163).
* Aaron Siegel of Apple Product Security
  reported that the CUPS web interface does not verify the content of the
  "Host" HTTP header properly (CVE-2009-0164).
* Braden Thomas and
  Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported that CUPS is vulnerable to
  CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147 and CVE-2009-0166, found earlier in xpdf
  and poppler.

### Impact

A remote attacker might send or entice a user to send a specially
crafted print job to CUPS, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the configured CUPS user -- by
default this is "lp", or a Denial of Service. Furthermore, the web
interface could be used to conduct DNS rebinding attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.3.10"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-03-17 08:15:09 UTC  ``` Aaron Sigel of Apple Product Security reported that CUPS did not check Host: HTTP header in the connections to the daemon.  This insufficient checking may be of an advantage as part of some other attack, e.g. DNS rebinding attack (however, for such attack, user's web browser or browser plugin must be prone to the DNS rebinding attack).  Upstream patch adds check for the Host: header used in clients' requests.  It also introduced ServerAlias configuration directive, that must be used to allow clients to use additional valid host names besides those set has hostname or hostname's aliases.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-03-17 08:20:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 335489](attachment.cgi?id=335489&action=diff "Upstream Host: header checking patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=335489&action=edit "Upstream Host: header checking patch") Upstream Host: header checking patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-04-01 09:58:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 337477](attachment.cgi?id=337477&action=diff "Upstream documentation patch describing adding of new ServerAlias configuration directive") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=337477&action=edit "Upstream documentation patch describing adding of new ServerAlias configuration directive") Upstream documentation patch describing adding of new ServerAlias configuration directive   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-04-01 10:01:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 337478](attachment.cgi?id=337478&action=diff "The ServerAlias docs patch ported to RHEL-3 (1.1.17) cups -- similar change will be needed yet for doc/sam.shtml file yet") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=337478&action=edit "The ServerAlias docs patch ported to RHEL-3 (1.1.17) cups -- similar change will be needed yet for doc/sam.shtml file yet") The ServerAlias docs patch ported to RHEL-3 (1.1.17) cups -- similar change will be needed yet for doc/sam.shtml file yet   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-01 15:34:05 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.  The check introduced by this patch may break existing installations, where CUPS printing server is accessed by clients using DNS CNAME, that is not configured as a hostname or hostname alias on the server.  After applying this patch, CUPS server would refuse any connection attempts from such clients.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-02 07:54:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 337735](attachment.cgi?id=337735&action=diff "Updated upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=337735&action=edit "Updated upstream patch") Updated upstream patch  This patch adds support for localhost.localdomain as alternate localhost name.  It also adds support for '*' wildcard for use with ServerAlias directive.  This can be used to allow any name to be used in Host: header for non-localhost connections (localhost connections are treated separately, not influenced by ServerAlias settings) to emulate the behavior of older CUPS versions.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-17 10:01:58 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in 1.3.10, lifting embargo:   <http://www.cups.org/articles.php?L582>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c14)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-21 15:16:51 UTC  ``` cups-1.3.10-1.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.3.10-1.fc9>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c15)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-21 15:19:43 UTC  ``` cups-1.3.10-1.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/cups-1.3.10-1.fc10>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c16)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 00:47:06 UTC  ``` cups-1.3.10-1.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

This fix is required otherwise connections made using the ServerName hostname will be denied unless there is also a ServerAlias for that name.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c25)  Tim Waugh    2009-05-01 15:56:10 UTC  ``` I have seen some odd behaviour on Fedora 10 but have not been able to reproduce it, and it may be related to this change which is included in 1.3.10.  The problem seemed to be that cupsd was taking a very long time to look up the hostname associated with each network interface (some of which have no associated hostname), and doing this each time it sent browse information.  While it was doing this it could not process any IPP requests.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c26)  Josh Bressers    2011-07-26 18:06:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact. The risks associated with fixing this bug are greater than the security risk. We therefore have no plans to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=490597#c27)  Tim Waugh    2011-11-08 18:04:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 532352](attachment.cgi?id=532352&action=diff "cups-CVE-2009-0164.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=532352&action=edit "cups-CVE-2009-0164.patch") cups-CVE-2009-0164.patch  Here's a patch that bundles all the fixes together.  The two extra spec file changes required are:  %install ... # Disable Host: checking by default for compatibility.  The # ServerAlias directive was added in 1.3.10. for suffix in conf conf.default; do   cat <<"EOF" >> $RPM_BUILD_ROOT%{_sysconfdir}/cups/cupsd."$suffix"  # You should list each hostname alias used for this server so that it # can verify the correct name is used for it.

The fix is already available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 since the initial release.   ``` |  |
