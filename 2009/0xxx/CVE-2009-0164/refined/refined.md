{
  "cveId": "CVE-2009-0164",
  "description": "The web interface for CUPS before 1.3.10 does not validate the HTTP Host header in a client request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "Insufficient validation of the HTTP Host header.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The CUPS web interface does not properly verify the content of the HTTP Host header."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can potentially conduct DNS rebinding attacks.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Malicious web sites can leverage DNS rebinding techniques to access the CUPS web interface due to the lack of Host header validation."
        ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would need to craft a malicious website and exploit a DNS rebinding vulnerability.",
        "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass access restrictions by manipulating the Host header in requests to the CUPS web interface, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as starting and stopping printers or accessing printer information."
