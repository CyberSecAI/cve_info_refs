Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how the firewall engine in Microsoft ISA Server and Forefront Threat Management Gateway (TMG) handles TCP state for web proxy or web publishing listeners. Specifically, it's related to improper session state management within the firewall engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a denial of service condition. The flawed TCP state handling can lead to orphaned open sessions, eventually causing a web listener to become unresponsive to new requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit results in the affected web listener becoming non-responsive to new connection requests. This disrupts the service provided by the server, rendering it unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Packets:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted network packets to the affected system. The specific nature of these crafted packets is not detailed but it triggers the flawed session state management leading to the DoS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote and Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require prior authentication or any specific network position. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely, meaning they do not need access to the internal network or the server itself.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Microsoft documentation states that the vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin release.
- No mitigating factors or workarounds were identified, emphasizing the need for patching.
- The vulnerability affects:
    - Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway, Medium Business Edition.
    - Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2004 (all editions).
    - Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2006 (including Supportability Update and SP1).
