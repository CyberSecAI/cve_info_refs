Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-0841:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Missing input validation when constructing file paths for saving map query files. The `mapserv` CGI application uses the `IMAGEPATH`, `NAME` attributes from the map file and the `id` parameter from user input to construct a filename. It does not sanitize the `id` parameter, allowing directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Directory Traversal:**  The application does not validate or sanitize the user-provided `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `id` parameter, leading to arbitrary file creation outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Creation:** An attacker can create or overwrite files in arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially leading to:
    - Denial of service by overwriting critical system files
    - Modification or replacement of application files, leading to arbitrary code execution in some cases

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `mapserv` CGI application. The request includes:
    - A valid `map` parameter (pointing to an existing map file on the server)
    - A `mode=query` parameter
    - A `queryfile` parameter (possibly arbitrary)
    - A `savequery=1` parameter
    - A crafted `id` parameter containing directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `mapserv` application
- **Knowledge of MapServer:**  The attacker must know the location of a valid map file on the server, typically determined through legitimate server requests
- **(Optional) Access to write in the `imagepath`:** On Linux systems, the attack relies on the existence of a readable subdirectory inside the configured `IMAGEPATH` directory, otherwise the attack would fail.  On Windows systems this does not seem to be a requirement.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

- The vulnerability exists in MapServer versions 5.2.1 and 4.10.3.
- The vulnerability was fixed in MapServer versions 5.2.2 and 4.10.4.
- The vulnerability is triggered in mapserv.c (line 1783) and mapquery.c (line 89).
- The Debian security advisory (DSA-1914-1) also mentions that unless the attacker is able to create directories in the image path or there is already a readable directory this doesn't affect installations on Linux as the fopen() syscall will fail in case a sub path is not readable.
