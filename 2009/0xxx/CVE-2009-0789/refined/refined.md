This may\nallow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit\nany security vulnerabilities existing in the services it\nhas connected to.\nCVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may\nallow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded\nfrom a website to create arbitrary files with the\npermissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web\nStart application.\nCVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may\nallow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded\nfrom a website to create or delete arbitrary files with\nthe permissions of the user running the untrusted Java\nWeb Start application.\nCVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may\nallow an untrusted Java Web Start application to\ndetermine the location of the Java Web Start cache.\nCVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or\napplication to list the contents of the home directory of\nthe user running the applet or application.\nCVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an\nuntrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory\nlocations in the process that the applet or application is\nrunning in.\nCVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java\nPlug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network\nconnections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using\ncookies stored in the browser.\nCVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an\nuntrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that\nthe applet runs on and make network connections to hosts\nother than the host it was loaded from.\nCVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java\nRuntime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow\nan untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.\nFor example, an untrusted applet may grant itself\npermissions to read and write local files or execute local\napplications that are accessible to the user running the\nuntrusted applet.\nCVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start\napplication to make network connections to hosts other than\nthe host that the application is downloaded from.\nCVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment with launching Java Web Start applications may\nallow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate\nprivileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant\nitself permissions to read and write local files or execute\nlocal applications that are accessible to the user running\nthe untrusted application.\nCVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) with authenticating users through\nKerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the\nsystem as a whole, due to excessive consumption of\noperating system resources.\nCVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow\ncertain trusted operations to be performed, such as\nmodifying system properties.\nCVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows\ncode loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.\nThis may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local\nfilesystem and then subsequently run, to have network\naccess to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if\nthe code were loaded from a remote host. This may be\nleveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains\nthat map a name to the localhost).\nCVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)\ndecoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts\nencodings that are longer than the \"shortest\" form. This\nbehavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may\nbe leveraged to exploit systems running software that\nrelies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form\nsequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be\ndecoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that\nare not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are\nnot checked following UTF-8 decoding.\nCVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates\ntemporary files with insufficiently random names. This may\nbe leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as\nuntrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access\nand provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.\nCVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects\nmay allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate\nprivileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant\nitself permissions to read and write local files or execute\nlocal applications that are accessible to the user running\nthe untrusted applet.\nCVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an\nuntrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate\nprivileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant\nitself permissions to read and write local files or execute\nlocal applications that are accessible to the user running\nthe untrusted applet.\nCVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java\nRuntime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java\napplication that is launched through the command line to\nescalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java\napplication may grant itself permissions to read and write\nlocal files or execute local applications that are\naccessible to the user running the untrusted Java\napplication.\nThis vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or\nJava Web Start application.\nCVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime\nEnvironment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an\nuntrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate\nprivileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant\nitself permissions to read and write local files or execute\nlocal applications that are accessible to the user running\nthe untrusted applet.\nCVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web\nStart BasicService allows untrusted applications that are\ndownloaded from another system to request local files to be\ndisplayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted\napplication.\nAffected products: SUSE CORE 9, SLE 10\n- kdegraphics3\nThis update fixes security problems while decoding JBIG2.\n(CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-0165, CVE-2009-0166,\nCVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-0800, CVE-2009-1179, CVE-2009-1180,\nCVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1182, CVE-2009-1183)\nAffected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1\n- libopenssl-devel/openssl/compat-openssl097g\nThis update of openssl fixes the following problems:\n- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1_STRING_print_ex() function allows remote denial\nof service\n- CVE-2009-0591: CMS_verify() function allows signatures to look valid\n- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures\nAffected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1\n- libsoup\nLarge strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and\ndecoding functions.

The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is\nguaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE\nsecurity announcements are published with a valid signature.\nTo verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file\nand run the command\ngpg --verify <file>\nreplacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.\nThe output for a valid signature looks like:\ngpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9\ngpg: Good signature from \"SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>\"\nwhere <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.\nIf the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can\nimport it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the\ncommand\ngpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc\n- Package authenticity verification:\nSUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the\nworld. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free\nand open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a\npackage needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.\nThe internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the\nauthenticity of an RPM package. Use the command\nrpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>\nto verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the\nfilename of the RPM package downloaded.
