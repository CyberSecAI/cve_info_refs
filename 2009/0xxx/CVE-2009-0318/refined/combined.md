| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c0)  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat Security Response)    2009-01-29 11:05:43 UTC  ``` Please describe the problem: Untrusted search path vulnerability in the GObject wrapper around Python interpreter allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to an erroneous setting of sys.path by the PySys_SetArgv function.  References (more details, test case): <http://www.nabble.com/Bug-484305%3A-bicyclerepair%3A-bike.vim-imports-untrusted-python-files-from-cwd-td18848099.html>  Relevant part of the code in gnumeric-N.V.R/plugins/python-loader/gnm-py-interpreter.c:      103         PySys_SetArgv (G_N_ELEMENTS (plugin_argv) - 1, plugin_argv);     104         py_initgnumeric (interpreter);  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier CVE-2009-0318 to this vulnerability:  Untrusted search path vulnerability in the GObject Python interpreter wrapper in Gnumeric allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to a vulnerability in the PySys_SetArgv function (CVE-2008-5983).

Other information: ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c1)  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala (Red Hat Security Response)    2009-01-29 11:16:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 127446](attachment.cgi?id=127446 "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=127446&action=edit "patch") [[review]](review?bug=569648&attachment=127446) patch ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c2)  Jon KÃ¥re Hellan    2009-01-29 11:55:01 UTC  ``` Here's what sys.path looks like on my development system immediately after PyInitialize has been called: ['/usr/lib/python25.zip', '/usr/lib/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Numeric', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/PIL', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gst-0.10', '/var/lib/python-support/python2.5', '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/gtk-2.0', '/var/lib/python-support/python2.5/gtk-2.0']  This is gnumeric built against python 2.5.2-2ubuntu4.1. Looks safe to me. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c3)  Jon KÃ¥re Hellan    2009-01-29 12:13:42 UTC  ``` Sorry, I was too fast. We do have the unsafe path in gnm_py_interpreter - after PySys_SetArgv at l. 104 in gnm-py-interpreter.c. The reason we are changing the argv there is r5632 by Zbigniew Chyla:  * py-gnumeric.c (create_python_interpreter): Call PySys_SetArgv after creating new interpreter (some modules assume that sys.argv is always set). ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c4)  Jon KÃ¥re Hellan    2009-01-29 13:08:47 UTC  ``` Huzaifa's patch is OK for Linux, so go ahead and use it. According to <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504251#26>, it won't work on BSD, though. That's why vim gives a garbage path to PySys_SetArgv and explicitly filters that out of sys.path.  vim code: static char *(argv[2]) = {"/must>not&exist/foo", NULL}; .. PyRun_SimpleString("import sys; sys.path =   filter(lambda x: x != '/must>not&exist', sys.path)"  Patch coming up soon. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c5)  Jon KÃ¥re Hellan    2009-01-29 13:35:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 127457](attachment.cgi?id=127457 "Fix vulnerability") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=127457&action=edit "Fix vulnerability") [[review]](review?bug=569648&attachment=127457) Fix vulnerability ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c6)  Morten Welinder    2009-01-29 13:47:58 UTC  ``` Why not just use "/dev/null/python/is/buggy/gnumeric" and not filter anything?  ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c7)  Jon KÃ¥re Hellan    2009-01-29 14:07:26 UTC  ``` This problem has been fixed in the development version. The fix will be available in the next major software release. Thank you for your bug report.  ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c8)  J.H.M. Dassen (Ray)    2009-01-29 18:17:28 UTC  ``` I've also applied the patch on the gnumeric-1-8 branch: 	<http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnumeric?view=revision&revision=17111>  ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c9)  J.H.M. Dassen (Ray)    2009-01-29 18:42:37 UTC  ``` And to 1-6 as well (sorry, we're stuck with that in Debian stable...).  ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c10)  Morten Welinder    2009-01-30 15:21:05 UTC  ``` Just for the record:  The bug is in Python.  There was no problem with the Gnumeric code. All we are doing here is to work around that bug until the Python people can be bothered to fix their problem.  It would have been nice if Redhat didn't feel the need to blame us for Python's problem.  ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c11)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-01-31 16:27:59 UTC  ``` FWIW, [comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c10) seems right to me, see  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814>  for the downstream "fix it in python not every app" bug.  I talked to our python maintainer (James Antill) about this a few days ago and he's looking into a fix in python. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=569648#c12)  Morten Welinder    2009-02-07 19:18:53 UTC  ``` Changing to the proper status of NOTGNOME.  ``` |  |

Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany,
	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Hello Steve,

  initially CVE-2008-4863 has been assigned for the Blender's
untrusted search path issue.

Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the
beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python
maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need
of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading
Python modules.

Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in
the following packages:

# Gnumeric: Untrusted search path — GLSA **200904-03**

An untrusted search path vulnerability in Gnumeric might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/gnumeric** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.4-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.4-r1** |

### Background

The Gnumeric spreadsheet is a versatile application developed as part
of the GNOME Office project.

### Description

James Vega reported an untrusted search path vulnerability in the
GObject Python interpreter wrapper in Gnumeric.

### Impact

A local attacker could entice a user to run Gnumeric from a directory
containing a specially crafted python module, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Gnumeric.

### Workaround

Do not run "gnumeric" from untrusted working directories.

### Resolution

All Gnumeric users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/gnumeric-1.8.4-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 14:18:04 UTC  ``` Untrusted search path vulnerability in the GObject wrapper around Python interpreter allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to an erroneous setting of sys.path by the PySys_SetArgv function.  References (more details, test case): <http://www.nabble.com/Bug-484305%3A-bicyclerepair%3A-bike.vim-imports-untrusted-python-files-from-cwd-td18848099.html>  Relevant part of the code in gnumeric-N.V.R/plugins/python-loader/gnm-py-interpreter.c:      103         PySys_SetArgv (G_N_ELEMENTS (plugin_argv) - 1, plugin_argv);     104         py_initgnumeric (interpreter);  Proposed patch: The Debian patch for similar dia's Python related issue, available at:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?msg=5;filename=pythonpath.diff;att=1;bug=504251>  should be sufficient to resolve this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-26 14:19:52 UTC  ``` This issue affects all versions of the Gnumeric package, as shipped with Fedora release of 9, 10 and devel.  Please fix.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-28 11:06:09 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-0318](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0318) to this vulnerability:  Untrusted search path vulnerability in the GObject Python interpreter wrapper in Gnumeric allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to a vulnerability in the PySys_SetArgv function ([CVE-2008-5983](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-5983)).  References: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0318> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/01/26/2>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c3)  M Welinder    2009-01-29 00:30:10 UTC  ``` Would it be too much to ask for this to be fixed in Python instead of going through every single python user and try to fix it there?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2009-01-29 10:48:16 UTC  ``` The following patch should resolve the issue:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=513418>  However as per this page   "Going by <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504251#26> this patch may not be sufficient."  So i am not sure if this patch will resolve the issue   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2009-01-29 11:08:33 UTC  ``` Opened an upstream bug at: <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=569648>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-29 11:21:08 UTC  ``` More explanation why this issue wasn't fixed in Python yet, can be found here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c1 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5983 python: untrusted python modules search path")  here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5983 python: untrusted python modules search path")  and here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=482814#c5 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-5983 python: untrusted python modules search path")  Looks like the Python fix won't come anytime soon, so please fix the issue in the package, till we find the proper Python solution.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-29 11:27:23 UTC  ``` Ray Strode's test case to check the work of the fix can be found here:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8](show_bug.cgi?id=481556#c8 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2009-0314 gedit: untrusted python modules search path")   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c8)  M Welinder    2009-01-29 14:09:03 UTC  ``` So it basically boils down to...      We know it's python's fault, but they don't want to (or cannot figure     out how to) fix it.  Therefore, let's put a black mark on all these     applications and work around it there.  How do you know you got them all?  -- including all future users of python.  Upstream fixed: <http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnumeric?view=revision&revision=17109>  static char *plugin_argv[] = {(char *) "/dev/null/python/is/buggy/gnumeric", NULL};  (without any filtering)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c9)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2009-01-30 09:43:39 UTC  ``` I am going ahead with my patch, As per upstream bugzilla reply.  "Huzaifa's patch is OK for Linux, so go ahead and use it."  The upstream has patched it for devel version afaik, which i dont want to package for fedora yet until it stablizes.  F-10 is already build, now for others.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c10)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-30 10:00:14 UTC  ``` Re comment c#8:  Re: How do you know you got them all?  -- including all future users of python.  1, Searching for the occurrence of 'magic Python string PySys_SetArgv(1, argv)'    in the code of all the srpms, as shipped within Fedora 10 Everything repo  2, Hoping the people from other distros will do the same with the pkgs,    they ship.  3, Hoping, the search for complete Python patch won't be neverending    story and once this fix will get escalated into the Python upstream    code also.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c11)  Nikolaus Filus    2009-02-03 19:08:44 UTC  ``` I seem to be a recent victim of this bug as I wondered for several weeks now, why my totem and my rhythmbox players crashed at startup. I even filed bugs for both projects and tried to get help from the developers. After some debuggin it was sure, that python plugins were the culprit as both apps crashed while initializing the embedded interpreter. The reason was actually found now:  I'm a hobby python programmer and downloaded some recipes from ASPN and saved them in my $HOME - one of them was a custom optparse.py! Now most python libs will ask for optparse sooner or later and as $HOME seems to be the CWD for the whole Xorg session all my GUI apps crashed with a SIGSEV when opened from nautilus.  Please try to find a fix ASAP....   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-02-05 02:15:08 UTC  ``` gnumeric-1.8.2-6.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=481572#c13)  Fedora Update System    2009-02-05 02:15:43 UTC  ``` gnumeric-1.8.2-4.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
