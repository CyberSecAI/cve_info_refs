{
  "CVE-2009-0318": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an untrusted search path issue in the GObject wrapper around the Python interpreter. Specifically, the `PySys_SetArgv` function erroneously sets `sys.path`, adding the current working directory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if a malicious Python file is present.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Untrusted search path vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application (Gnumeric in this case) by placing a specially crafted Python module in the current working directory.",
       "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation, where the attacker places a malicious Python module in the directory from which the user runs the vulnerable application.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access and must be able to create a malicious python file in a directory the user is likely to run the affected application from."
    },
    {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the way Python's `PySys_SetArgv` function handles the module search path. When called, it inserts the current working directory (CWD) at the beginning of the Python module search path. This behavior, while intended, can be exploited if a user runs a Python application from an untrusted directory containing malicious Python scripts.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The core vulnerability is in the Python interpreter, where the addition of the current working directory to `sys.path` is considered unsafe. Specific applications using `PySys_SetArgv`, such as Gnumeric (via its GObject wrapper), are vulnerable.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application by creating a malicious Python module with the same name as an expected module in the current working directory.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local. An attacker places a malicious Python file in a directory and tricks the user into launching a vulnerable application (like Gnumeric) from that directory.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to create a malicious Python file in a directory where a user is likely to execute a vulnerable application and have that user execute the application."
    },
   {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the GObject Python interpreter wrapper in Gnumeric which incorrectly sets the python module search path by using the function `PySys_SetArgv`. This results in the current working directory being added to the search path, thus allowing the execution of arbitrary code if a malicious python script is present in the current working directory.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is in the improper use of `PySys_SetArgv` resulting in an untrusted search path vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Gnumeric by placing a malicious python script in the current working directory.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation where an attacker can plant a malicious python file in a directory and entice a user to run gnumeric from that directory.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to create a malicious python file in a directory a user is likely to execute gnumeric from."
