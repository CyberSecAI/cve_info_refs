{
  "CVE-2009-0676": {
    "description": "The sock_getsockopt function in net/core/sock.c, optval v.val is not correctly initialized and directly returned in userland in case we have SO_BSDCOMPAT option set.",
    "root_cause": "The `optval` variable within the `sock_getsockopt` function was not properly initialized before being returned to user space when the `SO_BSDCOMPAT` option was set.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
	  "Uninitialized Variable"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially read sensitive kernel memory by calling `getsockopt` with the `SO_BSDCOMPAT` option.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered locally via a specially crafted `getsockopt` system call.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to execute code locally to call getsockopt with the SO_BSDCOMPAT option."
