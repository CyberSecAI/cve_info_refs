Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0834:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Linux kernel's system call auditing implementation on x86_64 architectures. Specifically, the `audit_syscall_entry()` function does not properly differentiate between 32-bit and 64-bit system calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect Syscall Table Lookup:** When a 32-bit process executes a 64-bit syscall or a 64-bit process executes a 32-bit syscall, the `audit_syscall_entry()` function uses the incorrect system call table.
*   **Incorrect Argument Registers:** The function also uses the wrong system call argument registers in these cases.
*   **Bypass of Syscall Filtering:** This improper handling allows local users to bypass syscall auditing configurations which filter based on syscall numbers or argument details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Circumvention of Auditing:** Local users can bypass intended system call restrictions set up by audit configurations.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Bypassing restrictions might allow an attacker to perform actions otherwise blocked by security policies potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** A local attacker with access to the system can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Crafted Syscalls:** The attacker crafts specific 32-bit or 64-bit syscalls, depending on the context, designed to exploit the incorrect handling in the `audit_syscall_entry()` function.
*   **Switching Modes:**  Attackers might switch between 32-bit and 64-bit modes using instructions like `ljmp` and then use `syscall` or `int $0x80` instructions respectively to execute their crafted syscalls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** They must be able to execute code on the system to initiate the crafted syscalls.
*   **Understanding of Syscall Mechanism:** The attacker needs a good understanding of how system calls work on x86-64 systems, particularly the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit syscall mechanisms.

**Additional Details from Content**

*   The vulnerability affects amd64 kernels, specifically those where a 32-bit process makes a 64-bit syscall, or a 64-bit process makes a 32-bit syscall.
*   The vulnerability exists within the `audit_syscall_entry()` function.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by local users.
*   The vulnerability is related to syscall filtering mechanisms, and how they may be bypassed.
*   Red Hat assigned a CVSS score of 3.6 (Low)
*   The issue is fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, as well as MRG for RHEL-5 and the patch is also included in various other distributions (SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu)
