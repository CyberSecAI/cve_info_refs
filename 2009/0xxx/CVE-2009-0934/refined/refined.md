Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient input sanitization in ejabberd's handling of MUC (Multi-User Chat) logs. Specifically, the server was not properly sanitizing user-provided input before including it in the logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper sanitization allowed malicious users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into MUC logs. When other users viewed these logs, the malicious script would be executed within their browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The primary impact is cross-site scripting (XSS), which can lead to a range of attacks, including:
    *   Session hijacking: An attacker could steal a user's session cookie, allowing them to impersonate that user.
    *   Data theft: Sensitive information displayed within the user's browser could be accessed by the attacker.
    *   Malware distribution: The attacker could redirect the user to a site hosting malware.
    *   Defacement: The attacker could modify the content of the page viewed by the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the MUC functionality. A malicious user would inject XSS payloads by sending specially crafted messages to a chat room that are then logged.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a participant in a chat room whose logs are recorded by the vulnerable ejabberd server. They need to be able to send messages that include malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involved linkifying only a few known protocols in MUC logs, likely preventing the execution of injected JavaScript
*   The vulnerability was present in ejabberd versions prior to 2.0.1-6+lenny1 (Debian stable), and 2.0.5-1 (Debian unstable).
*   The issue was resolved in the mentioned versions for Debian and by the 2.0.4 release from the ejabberd project.
