```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's `export.php` script includes a file specified by the `export_to` parameter without proper sanitization, leading to local file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application does not validate or sanitize the 'export_to' parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`, potentially leading to information disclosure and further compromise of the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `export.php` script with the `export_to` parameter set to a path of a file they want to read from the server. URL encoding and null byte injection are used to bypass any potential filtering.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is necessary."
