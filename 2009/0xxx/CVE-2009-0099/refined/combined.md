# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Could Allow Remote Code Execution (959239)

Published: February 10, 2009 | Updated: May 26, 2009

**Version:** 3.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. The first vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a specially crafted TNEF message is sent to a Microsoft Exchange Server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system with Exchange Server service account privileges. The second vulnerability could allow denial of service if a specially crafted MAPI command is sent to a Microsoft Exchange Server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service and other services that use the EMSMDB32 provider to stop responding.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server, Microsoft Exchange Server 2003, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, and Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way Microsoft Exchange Server interprets TNEF messages and MAPI commands. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin re-released on May 26, 2009?**

Microsoft revised this security bulletin to announce a detection change for this security update. As a result of the correction, the detection now offers the Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2 (KB959897) update to systems running the Exchange System Management Tools for Exchange Server 2003 on which no active instance of the Exchange service is running. Previously, this configuration was not offered the security update. Customers who have already installed the KB959897 update successfully on these systems do not need to reinstall the update.

**Why was this bulletin re-released on February 16, 2009?**

Microsoft re-released this bulletin to add the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client as affected software. No other update packages are affected by this re-release. Customers running all other supported and affected versions of Microsoft Exchange Server who have already successfully applied the original security update packages do not need to take any further action with those original update packages.

Microsoft also revised this bulletin to add several entries to the section, **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update**, relating to updating the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client and the Exchange System Management tools.

**I am using an older version of the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client, how do I update to version 6.5.8069?**

Microsoft has provided a free update for Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client users to version 6.5.8069 available on the [Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e17e7f31-079a-43a9-bff2-0a110307611e). As a result, all customers using an older version of the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client and Collaboration Data Objects 1.2.1 package should update to version 6.5.8069 to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

**The update package for the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client also includes CDO 1.2.1. Is CDO 1.2.1 affected by the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin?**

The download for the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client also includes the package for Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) 1.2.1. The CDO 1.2.1 package is not affected by the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin. The package is included in the download for your convenience.

**How do I know if I have Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client and Collaboration Data Objects 1.2.1 installed on my system?**

In Control Panel, check the **Add or Remove Programs** tool (Windows Server 2003 and earlier) or **Programs and Features** (Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008) for the entry, "Messaging API and Collaboration Data Objects 1.2.1."

The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959239](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/959239).

**What is the difference between the servicing models for Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2003, and how does the difference impact the updates in this security bulletin?**

With the release of Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, Microsoft Exchange has moved to a new servicing model based on customer feedback and consistency with other Microsoft product servicing models. Exchange Server 2007 updates are cumulative at both the offered update level and at the individual file level, while Exchange Server 2003 updates are cumulative at the file level only.

For a more detailed explanation of the Microsoft Exchange servicing model, please see the [Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 product documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89577). For questions regarding the new Exchange servicing model, please contact [Microsoft Product Support Services](https://support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx).

**Do I need to install the update rollup package for** **Exchange Server 2007-based servers in a particular sequence?**

Our test infrastructure helps guarantee that our updates work among multiple server roles. Therefore, you do not have to apply an update rollup package in a required order to the Exchange servers that are running different roles. However, you should apply an update rollup package to each Exchange Server 2007-based server in your environment. This is true because the update rollups are not divided for use with different Exchange roles or for use with particular file configurations.

If you are a customer of CAS Proxy Deployment Guidance, and if you have deployed CAS-CAS proxying, apply the update rollup to the Internet-facing Client Access servers before you apply the update rollup to the non-Internet-facing Client Access servers. For other Exchange Server 2007 configurations, the order in which you apply the update rollup to the servers is not important.

For more information about CAS-CAS proxying, see [Understanding Proxying and Redirection](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb310763.aspx).

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

## Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0098

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Exchange Server decodes the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) data for a message.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0098](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0098).

#### Mitigating Factors for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0098

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0098

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block MS-TNEF on Microsoft Exchange Server to help protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability through SMTP e-mail**

  Blocking the application/ms-tnef MIME content type, could help protect Exchange servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers cannot install the available security update.

  Systems can be configured to block certain types of files from being received as e-mail attachments. Microsoft TNEF-encoded e-mail messages, commonly known as rich text format (RTF) e-mail messages, can contain malicious OLE objects. These e-mail messages contain a file attachment that stores the TNEF information. This file attachment is usually named Winmail.dat. Blocking this file, and blocking the ms-tnef MIME type, could help protect Exchange servers and other affected programs from attempts to exploit this vulnerability if customers cannot install the available security update. To help protect an Exchange Server computer from attacks through SMTP, block the Winmail.dat file and all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it reaches the Exchange Server computer.

  **Note** You cannot mitigate this vulnerability by setting **the Exchange rich-text format** option in Exchange Server to **Never used** or by disabling TNEF processing by editing the registry.

  **Note** Exchange supports other messaging protocols, such as X.400, that these workarounds do not protect. We recommend that administrators require authentication on all other client and message transport protocols to help prevent attacks using these protocols.

  **Note** Filtering only for attachments that have the file name Winmail.dat may not be sufficient to help protect your system. A malicious file attachment could be given another file name that could then be processed by the Exchange Server computer. To help protect against malicious e-mail messageâs, block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content.

  There are many ways to block the Winmail.dat file and other TNEF content. Here are some suggestions:

  + You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Message Screener to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 315132](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=315132).
  + You can use ISA Server 2000 SMTP Filter to block all file attachments or to block only the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2000 because ISA Server 2000 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320703](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=320703).
  + You can use ISA Server 2004 SMTP Filter and Message Screener block all file attachments or just the Winmail.dat file. Blocking all file attachments provides the most protection for this issue if you use ISA Server 2004 because ISA Server 2004 does not support blocking content based on MIME content types. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 888709](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=888709).
  + You can use attachment filtering in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to apply filters at the server level to control the attachments that users receive. See [Attachment Filtering](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb124399.aspx) for more information.
  + You can use third-party e-mail filters to block all application/ms-tnef MIME type content before it is sent to the Exchange Server computer or to a vulnerable application.

  **Impact of workaround:** If TNEF attachments are blocked, e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF will not be received correctly. In some cases, users could receive blank e-mail messages instead of the original RTF-formatted e-mail message. In other cases, users may not receive e-mail messages that are formatted as RTF at all. Blocking the TNEF attachments will not affect e-mail messages that are formatted as HTML or that are formatted as plain text.

#### FAQ for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0098

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system with Exchange Server service account privileges when a user opens or previews a specially crafted e-mail message sent in TNEF format or when the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store processes the specially crafted message. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Exchange server does not properly decode a message received in TNEF format.

**What is TNEF?**

Transport Neutral Encapsulation (TNEF) is a format used by the Microsoft Exchange Server when sending messages formatted as Rich Text Format (RTF). When Microsoft Exchange is sending a message to another Microsoft e-mail client, it extracts all the formatting information and encodes it in a special TNEF block. It then sends the message in two parts: the text message with the formatting removed, and the formatting instructions in the TNEF block. On the receiving side, a Microsoft e-mail client processes the TNEF block and re-formats the message.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system with Exchange Server service account privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted TNEF message to a Microsoft Exchange Server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Exchange Servers are at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update corrects the way that Microsoft Exchange Server interprets specific TNEF properties.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Literal Processing Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0099

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the EMSMDB2 (Electronic Messaging System Microsoft Data Base, 32 bit build) provider because of the way it handles invalid MAPI commands. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted MAPI command to the application using the EMSMDB32 provider. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the application to stop responding.

The denial of service vulnerability also affects the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant since it uses the EMSMDB32 provider. The Microsoft Exchange System Attendant is one of the core services in Microsoft Exchange and performs a variety of functions related to the on-going maintenance of the Exchange system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0099](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0099).

#### FAQ for Literal Processing Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0099

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service and other services that use the EMSMDB32 provider to stop responding.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Exchange Server incorrectly handling a command in the EMSMDB32 provider.

**What is MAPI?**

MAPI is a set of functions that mail-enabled and mail-aware applications use to create, manipulate, transfer, and store mail messages. It gives application developers the tools to define the purpose and content of mail messages and gives them flexibility in their management of stored mail messages. MAPI also provides a common interface that application developers can use to create mail-enabled and mail-aware applications independent of the underlying messaging system. See the [MFC Library Reference for MAPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/245421h5%28vs.80%29.aspx) for more information.

**What is EMSMDB32?**

Electronic Messaging System Microsoft Data Base, 32 bit build (EMSMDB32) provider refers to the Exchange Transport provider which implements both a transport and a message store provider for MAPI. It provides the ability to submit messages to Exchange Server and to read (and possible write) messages to an Exchange store. See [How Outlook, CDO, MAPI, and Providers Work Together](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa996249.aspx) for more information on how MAPI and providers work together.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the application or service using the EMSMDB32 provider to stop responding. One of the services that could stop responding is the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service, since it uses the EMSMDB32 provider. The Microsoft Exchange System Attendant performs a variety of functions related to the on-going maintenance and processing of the Exchange system such as the generation of address lists, offline address books and directory lookup facilities. These tasks will be affected if the Exchange System Attendant service stops working.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted MAPI command to a Microsoft Exchange Server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the mail service to stop responding.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Exchange server systems utilizing the EMSMDB provider are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Exchange Server handles malformed MAPI commands.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Exchange, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft Exchange hotfix.

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

A brief look at the history of malware shows us that this harmful threat has followed us since the beginning of the computer itself. According to Scientific American, the idea of a computer virus dates back to 1949, when early computer scientist John von Neumann wrote “The Theory and Organization of Complex Automata,” an article that assumes how a computer program could reproduce. In the 1950s, Bell Labs employees revived von Neumann’s idea when they created a game called “Core Wars.” In the game, programmers released software “organisms” that competed to control the computer.

The earliest documented viruses began to appear in the early 1970s. Historians are often the first to use “Creeper Worm,” an experimental self-replication program written by Bob Thomas of BBN Technologies. Creeper had access to ARPANEST and copied himself to external systems, where it showed the message: “I’m an indexer, take me if you can!”

But the term “virus” wasn’t introduced until the mid-1980s. Fred Cohen, often considered a computer virus, made the term in a doctoral thesis in 1986. In one sentence, he defined “virus” as follows: “A program that can infect other programs by modifying them to include a potentially advanced version of itself.”

From this simple and benevolent platform came a massive and diabolical industry. Today, according to the Anti-Phishing Task Force, malware has infected a third of the world’s computers. The consequences are astonishing. Cybersecurity Ventures reports that losses from cybercrime, including malware, are expected to reach $6 trillion a year by 2021.

In this post, we will briefly review the history of malware and how it evolved and affected the world. For a closer look at different types of malware, see the Lastlines Malware Types and Ratings blog.

## History of malware – First years

Early malware was primitive and often spread completely offline on floppy disks carried by human-handers from computer to computer. As networks and the Internet mature, malware makers quickly adapt malware and take advantage of new communications media.

## History of malware – Toolkits and amazing infection prices

Between 2000 and 2010, malware increased significantly in both the number and number of bouncy infections. At the turn of the millennium, internet and email esmads made headlines around the world. Later, we saw a dramatic increase in malware toolkits, including the now infamous Sony rootkit, which was essential for malware makers, including rootkits in most modern malware. Crimeware packages specifically aimed at websites also grew in popularity, and the number of compromised websites increased accordingly. SQL injection attacks became a leading threat and require popular victims such as IKEA. See [jammin jars by casumo](https://www.casumo.com/en-gb/play/jammin-jars/) to get to learn more.

## [Turn off remote access](https://www.voipshield.com/turn-off-remote-access/)

[11th March 2021](https://www.voipshield.com/turn-off-remote-access/ "5:19 pm")

[![kk1 - Turn off remote access](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kk1.jpg "Turn off remote access")](https://www.voipshield.com/turn-off-remote-access/ "Turn off remote access")

Windows 10 has a Windows Remote Desktop feature that allows you (or others!) Connect remotely to your computer through a network connection. Remote access allows anyone to control everything on your computer as if they were directly connected to it.

Unfortunately, hackers can take advantage of Windows Remote Desktop. In more than one cyberattack, criminals have gained access to manage external systems, installed malware, or stolen databases that are full of personal information.

This feature is disabled by default. Once activated, it will be easy for you to turn it off again. You want to keep the remote access feature disabled unless you are actively using it.

## Enable or install antivirus tools.

You can block viruses and malware with the built-in tools in Windows 10. You can also install multiple antivirus programs if you need to (we have some of our favorites on securicy’s Marketplace).

Enterprise versions of Windows 10 include Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, a security platform that monitors endpoints, such as Microsoft’s SmartScreen technology, another built-in feature that controls downloads and prevents malicious people from running.

Enable automatic updates for the operating system.

Install critical security updates immediately. Some security updates are important updates that protect you from new types of malware or cyberattacks.

Your organization may also have a security policy for updating the operating system. You can see if you’re installing updates directly or if your IT team tells you when updates are installed. Depending on your business, your IT team may be responsible for updating your operating system.

Ultimately, it does not skip operating system updates for critical security updates. (Even if you’ve heard of a design change, you don’t like it.) Microsoft keeps it relatively easy by configuring two types of updates: quality updates, feature updates. They also long kept a schedule of updates known in the IT world as Patch on Tuesday.

If your business is running on an older version of Windows? Be sure to upgrade your operating system before they become a security workshop. Support for Windows 7 expires in January 2020, meaning anyone still using it (or an older operating system!) New malware or virus scenes are at risk.

## Enable encryption.

BitLocker is Microsoft’s own disk encryption program that is included with Windows 10. Encryption is a security technology that can sound daunting, but in this case it is as simple as clicking “Enable Bitlocker”. Bitlocker has set a password, gives you a recovery key, and shows you the “Encrypt entire device” option.

Bitlocker data encryption is free and you don’t need to install anything. Encryption encrypts your data so that only authorized users with your password can view, copy, or make changes. If your encrypted data were stolen, it would be useless. Encryption of the entire device also protects against unauthorized changes to the system, such as firmware-level malware.

Encryption is a method often included in the company’s security principles, including Securicy’s enterprise infosec program.

[![pexels andrea piacquadio 3760778 - Tips for security methods](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3760778.jpg "Tips for security methods")](https://www.voipshield.com/tips-for-security-methods/ "Tips for security methods")
## How can you harden your computer?

If you are improving your Windows 10 PC, configure security settings. This reduces the chances of viruses, hackers, ransomware, or other types of cyber attacks. You can use the wizard to use antivirus tools, turn off automatic logon, turn off remote access, set up encryption, and more.

You can think about the security of your computer (with all your personal, financial, or business information) just as you would think about the security of your house. Hardening your computer is like closing the doors and checking the locks. It’s harder for hackers to break in.

## Safety Method Tip Guide

## Disable automatic login in Windows 10.

This is one of the first settings that you need to change or check on your computer.

The first time you set up a new Windows 10-based computer, you create a user account. By default, your new account is set up to sign in automatically at startup. If you are at home all the time or do not have access to sensitive data, this may not be a problem. However, it can pose a serious security risk if someone can open your computer and then immediately access your data and business systems. This is especially important if you travel with a laptop and take it with you to places like a café, airport or open cooperation areas. Depending on your company’s safety policy, this can also be required by your employer. It is easy to disable, so in a few steps you can turn off automatic login. Get the steps here: How to disable auto-login in Windows 10

**Bonus tip**: If you’re traveling with a laptop or working in public places, you might want to get some privacy. They can make the screen look dark to prevent a criminal from “surfing on your shoulder” and looking at your private information. Privacy screens can also reduce glare and ease screen eyes, another reason to get one.

## Use the screen saver to enter a password.

No one in your office, home or destination needs access to your system if you walk away for a few minutes. It is a good idea to make sure that your computer locks automatically after a certain period of inactivity.

Although it is actually a security setting, you can find it in the Appearance and Customization section of Control Panel. To enable this, adjust the screen saver settings. It’s easy to choose when to show the screen saver, set the screen saver, and turn on the setting that takes you back to the sign-in screen when you return. Security begins by following basic protocols. So, be sure to protect your computer with a password.

## Turn on firewall.

In the latest versions of Windows operating systems, including Windows 10, the firewall is turned on by default. Simple enough! You must be ready here. However, checking the settings does not prevent the firewall from shutting down. Windows Firewall is a built-in network security system. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a private network or from a private network. Network firewalls are often used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks that are connected to the Internet, especially intranets. All messages that go inside or outside the intranet go through a firewall that scans each message and blocks anyone who does not meet the specified security conditions.

[11th March 2021](https://www.voipshield.com/tips-for-being-a-victim-of-computer-viruses/ "5:09 pm")

[![voipshield](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jc-gellidon-tfiW6Ko3R5M-unsplash.jpg "jc-gellidon-tfiW6Ko3R5M-unsplash")](https://www.voipshield.com/tips-for-being-a-victim-of-computer-viruses/ "Tips for being a victim of computer viruses")

The internet is a great place with endless banking entertaining and informative websites. However, falling victim to so-called “computer viruses” – malware, ransomware, and cryoviruses – can be surprisingly easy.

Viruses and hackers are constantly evolving their methods to get your data, but the good news is that there is much you can do to keep your system safe. Here are the 5 top tips to prevent you from falling victim to computer viruses.

## Install antivirus/malware.

It speaks for itself. The use of antivirus software is an obstacle to the system. There are many antivirus options that are very cheap, if not free; However, it may be a good idea to invest in something a little heavier if you receive a lot of email or spend most of your time on the Internet. Keep in mind that the cost of installing antivirus software is less than the cost of removing the virus and the working hours needed to recover lost data.

## Make sure the connection is secure.

Use a browser with the latest security protocols, such as <a0>Windows</a0> Or <a1>Windows</a1> Or <a2>Windows</a2> Chrome or Safari, to browse the web and make sure that all the websites you visit are safe. Most browsers warn you if you go to a website that is not secure and allows you to continue. If you are suspicious at all, the best option is to press the back button.

Another good way to check for a secure connection is to find the lock-shaped icon just before the BROWSER WINDOW URL. Secure websites also always start with “https://.” S is critical. Sites that start only with “http://” are not protected.

## Think before clicking

We have all been exposed to phishing emails. Thank God when that happens, we have antivirus software that grabs something harmful. If you receive an email that seems suspicious, the safest option is simply to delete it without opening it. However, if you notice that something isn’t turned off until you open the email, don’t click any of the links included in the message. Hopefully, spam filters intercept all phishing emails before you see them, but always be sure to check the sender’s address, especially in emails asking for personal information or passwords. These messages are almost always phishing emails.

## Keep the system up to date

When your operating system or computer programs tell you it’s time to perform an update, do so. Systems in the latest software are less susceptible to malware, ransomware and cryptoviruses.

Often backups. If all else fails, you can save data by backing up your system regularly (at least once a week) if you happen to fall victim to a computer virus. Be sure to save the backups to an external hard drive or cloud service. If you’re using an external hard drive or flash drive, keep multiple copies of your backups in different locations (such as in the office, one at home, and one in the lock box) so they don’t affect them and are easily accessible if you ever need them. If you want to use the cloud service, you can use one that allows version data (you can use multiple versions of your data from specific dates and times) instead of replacing existing backups with the latest version.

Cyberattacks don’t just happen to big companies. Small businesses, groups and charities must also protect their information systems. Here are some practical steps you can take today to tighten security.

## Backing up data

Back up your data and do it regularly. If possible, keep it away from your primary job. So if there are burglaries, fires or floods, you will not lose everything.

## Use strong passwords

Make sure you, your employees, volunteers, and everyone else in your business use strong passwords — including smartphones, laptops, tablets, email accounts, and computers.

Teach yourself and those who work for you how to detect suspicious emails. If you’re looking for clear signs like bad grammar, quick action, and payment requests, you can avoid getting caught. If it looks suspicious, don’t trust it either and alert your employees.

## Do not leave papers or laptops unattended

Data breaches can occur when employees and volunteers leave paperwork or laptops unattended. It could be in the trunk of a car, on a train or at home. Be sure to protect your privacy by being vigilant and keeping it safe when not in use. Using public Wi-Fi or a dangerous connection can compromise your personal data, so you should always use a secure connection to connect to the Internet.

## Lock the screen while away from your desktop

And make sure your employees do the same. It’s easy to lock the screen when you leave the desktop, but prevents other users from accessing the computer. You need to restrict who has access to your IT systems and buildings – you can’t let anyone in on your own because it makes your systems vulnerable. The fewer people you get, the better. Visitors must be clearly identifiable. Be sure to limit your IT usage to you wherever possible. If someone leaves your business, or if they are away for a long time, consider shutting down the use of the systems. Tracking personal information saves time and resources. It also helps you with your privacy obligations. Keep what you need for as long as you need it.

[![pexels canva studio 3153198 - Types of computer viruses](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-canva-studio-3153198.jpg "Types of computer viruses")](https://www.voipshield.com/types-of-computer-viruses/ "Types of computer viruses")
## Start sector virus

Viruses in the boot sector became popular because computer startup floppy disks are used. The widespread use of the Internet and the death of the flop have intensified other methods of spreading the virus.

## Browser Scanner

This type of virus, which can spread in many ways, including voluntary downloading, effectively hijacks certain browser features, usually in the form of automatic redirection of the user to certain websites. It is generally assumed that the purpose of this tactic is to increase revenue from online advertising.

## Direct action virus

Unlike most, this type of virus only takes effect when the file that contains the virus runs. The payload is delivered and then the virus is basically dormant – it does not take any other action unless the infected file is re-run.

Most viruses do not use a direct method of reproduction just because they are not productive, but these types of viruses have done damage in the past.

## File infection virus

Perhaps the most common type of virus, file infection takes root in the host file, and then starts working while the file is running. The virus can overwrite the infected file or only part of the file, or replace the file again so that the virus works instead of the program that the user intends. Macro viruses are viruses that use the macro programming language of an application to self-implement. Typical macro virus infected people are MS Word and MS Excel documents that spread to other similar documents.

## Multi-part virus

Although some viruses prefer to spread by one method or deliver one payload, the viruses in several batches have it all. This type of virus can spread in several ways, and it can perform various actions on an infected computer, depending on variables such as the installed operating system or specific files.

## Polymorphic virus

The polymorphic virus not only replicates by creating multiple files itself, but it also changes its digital signature every time it is replicated. Make it harder to detect less advanced antivirus software.

The aim of this trick is avoidance. Antivirus software uses the code you use frequently to detect viruses. If you hide or change the virus code, you can avoid detection. This extensive virus definition applies to all viruses that enter system memory. It can then do any number of actions and perform regardless of the file that was originally infected.

The ground virus is directly comparable to a payload virus that cannot access the system’s memory, so it only intervenes when the infected file is run. Many websites use complex code to provide interesting content. For example, to watch an online video in a browser, you need to run a specific encoding language that provides both the video itself and the player interface.

Of course, this code can sometimes be exploited, allowing the virus to infect your computer or take action on a computer through a website. Although malicious websites are sometimes created with deliberately infected code, there are many such cases of virus caused by the addition of code to the website without the knowledge of the web manager.

## Trojan Horse Virus

The Trojan virus is one of the most common and destructive computer viruses that appear to have a useful feature. It’s different from a common computer virus because Trojan horse viruses don’t replicate themselves. One of the most insidious trojan horse types is a program that claims to free your computer from viruses, but instead brings viruses to your computer. Trojan viruses can also create a backdoor on your computer that allows malicious users to access your computer, which can damage confidential or personal information. Worm is a malware that can make copies of it itself, it is designed to spread through computer networks. It is one of the most dangerous forms of computer viruses. It can be found mainly in spam attachments or messages with executable scripts. The worm is also known as malware.

When we talk about the security of the computer, infection is the main risk. It can destroy an app or the entire PC frame. The first infection was carried out in the 1970s and became known as creeper infection, which affected ARPANET computers. In 1981, the primary programmer performed an infection and spread through Apple floppy disks.

The dangers that affect your computer’s security are infections. Various dangers include Trojans, adware, worms and malware. Currently, infections are still common, which affects PC activity. Infections are also tools for programmers to add unauthorized access to your frame and take private information. It is important that Mcafee’s customer service is aware of the different types of infections that affect computers.

## Enables viruses

Personal infections live on in your RAM. This can interfere with a standard framework task that can cause documents and projects to become infected. The most significant infections to be inhabited are CMJ, Meve, MrKlunky and Randex.

## Multi-part virus

This type of infection can be spread without much stretching in the computer frame. It is very irresistible to perform activities that are not approved in the working framework, organizers and various projects on the computer. They can contaminate both the documents to be executed and the boots.

## Direct action virus

Direct action infections attack certain types of documents .exe .com detect. The main cause of this infection is to imitate and contaminate documents in envelopes. In a lighter note, they don’t usually delete records or affect your computer’s run and speed. It may well be effectively evacuated with antivirus software. This type of infection infects your browser where it takes you to different websites. If you want to enter a site name in the URL field, the program offender opens many fake websites that could harm your computer. On the other hand, most thought programs have worked on highlights to direct them forward.

## Replace Virus

From the name itself, this infection replaces the drug in the register and loses the first drug. It contaminates envelopes, documents and even projects. To remove this infection, you also need to get rid of your email. This is how it’s important to back up your data. This infection lives in certain compounds, campaigns, image situation, website storage and design. These can pass on malicious codes where infections are downloaded, or direct you to malicious websites when you click.

## Start Sector Virus

Disk circuits are affected by boot area infections. They were made because floppy disk circuits are important for starting the computer. Although they are not normal today, it still causes other PC devices, especially outdated ones. Some models include Polyboot.B and AntiEXE.

## Full-fledged virus

Full-scale infections affect programs and programming that contain macros. These infections can perform an arrangement of functions that affect the presentation of the program or programming. Some full-scale infections are O97M/Y2K, Bablas, Melissa.A and Relax. List infections change the paths to a document. When you run a project and programming that is infected with index infections, the infection program also stops constantly visible. Moreover, you may have difficulty finding the first application or programming when it is contaminated with index infections.

[15th May 201822nd August 2018](https://www.voipshield.com/20-common-types-of-viruses-affecting-your-computer/ "5:00 pm")

[![gg1 - 20 Common Types of Viruses Affecting Your Computer](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gg1.jpg "20 Common Types of Viruses Affecting Your Computer")](https://www.voipshield.com/20-common-types-of-viruses-affecting-your-computer/ "20 Common Types of Viruses Affecting Your Computer")

When we talk about computer security, the virus is the leading threat. It can destroy a single program or the whole computer system instead. The very first virus was created in the 1970s and was called the Creeper virus, affecting computers on the ARPANET. In 1981, the first hacker-made virus came into existence and spread through Apple floppy drives.

According to Information-Technology Promotion Agency, the numbers of viruses ballooned to 52,151 in 2004. However, due to certain programs that completely eliminate viruses, their numbers decreased to about 14,000 in 2010.

57% of the threats affecting your computer security is viruses. Other threats include Trojans, adware, worms, and malware, among others. Now, viruses are still widespread, affecting PC performance. Viruses are also tools of hackers to gain unauthorised access to your system and steal private information. It is important that you are aware of the different types of viruses that are affecting your computers.

## Resident Virus

Resident viruses live in your RAM memory. It can interfere with normal system operation which can lead to the corruption of files and programs. The most popular examples of resident viruses are CMJ, Meve, MrKlunky, and Randex.

## Multipartite Virus

This type of virus can easily spread in your computer system. It is very infectious, performing unauthorized actions in your operating system, in folders, and other programs on the computer. They have the ability to infect both the executable files and the boots sector.

## gg2 - 20 Common Types of Viruses Affecting Your Computer

## Direct Action Virus

Direct action viruses attack certain types of files, typically .exe and .com files. The main purpose of this virus is to replicate and infect files in folders. On the lighter note, they do not typically delete files or affect PC performance and speed. It can be easily removed by antivirus programs.

## Browser Hijacker

This type of virus infects your web browser in which it will bring you to different websites. Typically, if you key in a domain name in the internet address bar, the browser hijacker will open multiple fake websites that may harm your computer. On the other hand, most trusted browsers have built-in features to block them ahead.

## Overwrite Virus

From the name itself, this virus overwrites the content of a file, losing the original content. It infects folders, files, and even programs. To delete this virus, you also need to get rid of your file. Thus, it is important to back up your data.

## Web Scripting Virus

This virus lives in certain links, ads, image placement, videos, and layout of a website. These may carry malicious codes in which when you click, the viruses will be automatically downloaded or will direct you to malicious websites.

## Boot Sector Virus

Boot sector viruses affect floppy disks. They came to existence when floppy disks are important in booting a computer. Although they are not very common today, it is still causing other computer units, especially the outdated ones. Some examples include Polyboot.B and AntiEXE.

## gg3 - 20 Common Types of Viruses Affecting Your Computer

## Macro Virus

Macro viruses target applications and software that contain macros. These viruses can carry out series of operations affecting the performance of the program or software. Some examples of macro viruses are O97M/Y2K, Bablas, Melissa.A, and Relax.

## Directory Virus

Directory viruses change file paths. When you run programs and software that are infected with directory viruses, the virus program also runs in the background. Further, it may be difficult for you to locate the original app or software once infected with directory viruses.

## Polymorphic Virus

Polymorphic viruses use a special method of encoding or encryption every time they infect a system. With this, antivirus software finds it hard to locate then using signature searches. They are also capable of replicating easily. Polymorphic viruses include Satan Bug, Elkern, Tuareg, and Marburg.

## File Infector Virus

This virus also infects executable files or programs. When you run these programs, the file infector virus is activated as well which can slow down the program and produce other damaging effects. A large block of existing viruses belongs to this category.

## Encrypted Virus

This type of virus uses encrypted malicious codes which make antivirus software hard to detect them. They can only be detected when they decrypt themselves during replication. Although they don’t delete files or folders, they can badly affect PC performance.

## Companion Virus

This is a type of virus that doesn’t survive without accompanying an existing file or folder. In order to carry out damages, the file or folder being accompanied by companion viruses should be opened or run. Some examples of companion viruses include Terrax.1069, Stator, and Asimov.1539.

## Network Virus

Basically, this type of virus spreads out through Local Network Area (LAN) and through the internet. These viruses replicate through shared resources, including drives and folders. When network viruses enter a computer, they look for their potential prey. Dangerous network viruses include Nimda and SQLSlammer.

## gg1 - 20 Common Types of Viruses Affecting Your Computer

## Nonresident Virus

Nonresident viruses replicate through modules. When the module is executed, it will select one or more files to infect.

## Stealth Virus

Stealth viruses trick antivirus software by appearing like they are real files or programs and by intercepting its requests to the OS. Some antivirus software cannot detect them. Sometimes, it temporarily removes itself from the system without deletion.

## Sparse Infector

Sparse infectors use different techniques to minimize its detection. They are viruses that infect “occasionally”. For example, they may only want to infect a program every tenth execution. Because they are occasional infectors, antivirus software has a hard time detecting them.

## Spacefiller Virus

Also known as “cavity” viruses, spacefillers attach themselves to the file and can alter the start of the program or change the encrypted code. They also implement stealth techniques so that users cannot determine the increase the file code. The most popular Spacefiller is the Lehigh virus.

## FAT Virus

Basically, this type of virus ruins file allocation system where the information about files, including the location, exist.

## Others

Other threats are not technically called as “virus”, but they also have the same damaging effects as viruses. This includes worms, adware, malware, Trojan, and ransomware.

To prevent these viruses from affecting your computer, it is important that you install the best and the most competitive antivirus software that can detect, block, and eliminate all types of computer viruses.

[15th April 201822nd August 2018](https://www.voipshield.com/computer-basic-101-how-to-take-care-of-your-computer/ "5:05 pm")

[![kk1 - Computer Basic 101: How to Take Care of Your Computer?](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kk1.jpg "Computer Basic 101: How to Take Care of Your Computer?")](https://www.voipshield.com/computer-basic-101-how-to-take-care-of-your-computer/ "Computer Basic 101: How to Take Care of Your Computer?")

Almost all households in the world have their desktop computers. In the modern world, computers are very important – education, business, research, and other functions. In the United States, 85.1% of the American households have personal computer, according to 2016 statistics. Of course, as computer users, we should take care of our computers. In this article, we will discuss the basic care and maintenance of your computers.

## Keep your software up-to-date

Your computer will prompt you if there are software updates. It is important that you keep your software up-to-date, including your operating system to fix bugs, glitches, and vulnerabilities of the previous version. They also strengthen the security of your computer. Some computers perform automatic updates.

## Install antivirus software

A computer virus is a primary threat to computer health. They damage not just certain programs and software in your computer, but your system as a whole. It is important that you keep these viruses from entering your computer. Install antivirus software that will detect, block, and eliminate all types of viruses. There are dozens of competitive antivirus software available on the internet.

## Secure a backup of your files

Sometimes, computer problems and issues come unexpectedly. This may be due to cyberattack or power outage. It is best to be secure your files and documents in advance. There are two ways in backing up your data. First, you can use cloud storage in which you can upload copies of your files and documents through the internet. The second one is through external storage devices. Make sure to have multiple backups.

## Defragment your hard drive

Part of computer maintenance is by defragmenting your hard drive. Usually, computers are equipped with disk defragmenters. You just need to go to the system tools and run the disk defragmenter. In cases you do not have this, there are dozens of disk defragmenting programs and software that can be downloadable.

## Get rid of unused programs

Make it a habit to declutter your PC. Get rid of old files and programs that you do not need anymore. This will lessen the burden of your PC from running them in the background. The best way to do this is to install and run a disk cleanup program that deletes temporary files and clean your registry.

## kk2 - Computer Basic 101: How to Take Care of Your Computer?

## Activate the Firewall

Viruses can penetrate your computer systems through the internet. It is important to activate your firewall. A firewall acts as a gate or barrier that filters data from gaining unauthorized access to the computer system. Typically, computers have a built-in firewall. But if you want to strengthen security, install a third-party firewall that provides maximum internet protection.

## Safely remove devices

Most of you are guilty of this one – not safely removing external devices. It is a must that you eject devices, drives, and other media in a safe mode. This prevents corruption of data both in the computer and on the external drive.

## Consider reformatting

If your computer is really full of viruses and loads, affecting PC performance, consider reformatting. Of course, to do this, make sure you back up your files. Reformatting will bring back your computer the way it is before. However, we recommend that you let PC technicians do this for you.

## Clean your computer screens

When we tend to overuse the computer, we forget cleaning the computer externally, especially the screens. Like any other appliances, computers need regular cleaning. We advise that you use a soft cloth or special wipes in cleaning your computer screens and some other external parts of your computer. Get rid of dust, smudge, dirt, etc.

## Invest in cooling pads

Another factor that affects PC performance is overheating. When you use your computers for a longer period of time, consider buying cooling pads. Cooling pads are external devices that prevent computers from overheating. Apart from cooling pads, you can use fans. But if you want it to be easy, avoid using your computers in an environment with extreme temperatures.

## Take care of your battery

Laptop batteries do not last a lifetime. But you can extend its lifespan by taking good care of your battery. Avoid overcharging your battery. If it reaches 100%, make sure to unplug it. If you are not using your laptop, it is also recommended to remove the battery pack.

## Use a surge protector

Surge protectors are special appliances or devices that protect appliances, including the computer from voltage spikes. They limit the voltage supply, by blocking or shorting, to avoid the power from exceeding a safe threshold. It is a safe practice for your laptop or computer, especially when they are plugged into the power supply.

## kk1 - Computer Basic 101: How to Take Care of Your Computer?

## Protect your desktop

When we say “protect”, we meant literal protection. Buy cases or bags where you can safely store your laptops especially when traveling. Moreover, cover your desktop computer with a cloth. This can keep your computer away from dust.

## Avoid eating near computers

This is a must! Avoid eating near your computers, or better, do not eat while using your computer. Food crumbs or pieces may get into your keyboard and other parts of your computer which will attract ants, termites, and other insects. If this happens, the insects might destroy some internal parts on your computer.

## Consult a PC expert

Lastly, always ask a PC technician about your computer health. If you want to be 100% sure that your computer is doing okay, bring your unit to your favorite PC technician. Let them do the rebooting or reformatting, defragmentation, troubleshooting, and complete computer maintenance. If you are an owner of a website, make sure you consult an IT expert to make sure that your websites are safe and secure.

Basic care and maintenance for your computer are very important. It prevents certain factors and issues from arising, affecting the PC performance. If you take good care of your computer, you can get rid of viruses, malware, and other threats in advance. Invest in software that protects your PC from viruses, cleans up drives, and performs overall PC maintenance.

[19th March 201815th July 2019](https://www.voipshield.com/5-best-gadgets-to-keep-your-laptop-safe-while-travelling/ "4:30 pm")

[![laptop](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/laptop.png "laptop")](https://www.voipshield.com/5-best-gadgets-to-keep-your-laptop-safe-while-travelling/ "5 Best Gadgets to Keep Your Laptop Safe While Travelling")

Traveling is such fun. Even work trips can be exciting if you love your job and your accommodation is nice. But one thing that stresses everybody out is having to keep their laptops and other gadgets safe during this time. A laptop with work information, for example, can be extremely stressful to look after.

Not to mention the fact that, at times, you have to work and you expose yourself and the valuable data. Here are some of the gadgets you could use to keep your laptop safe during travel.

A little forward thinking never hurt anybody, and while these preparations may seem to take up more time, you will come to understand that safety is more important than anything.

![laptop - 5 Best Gadgets to Keep Your Laptop Safe While Travelling](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/laptop.png "5 Best Gadgets to Keep Your Laptop Safe While Travelling")

## TOP 5 GADGETS THAT KEEP YOUR LAPTOP SAFE WHILE TRAVELING

### 1. A USB Wi-Fi Adapter

Your computer is more vulnerable when you connect to random Wi-Fi networks. And since little can be done nowadays without a good Internet connection, it goes without saying that you will have to go online at some point. Therefore, in order to keep safe, it would be best to get a USB Wi-Fi Adapter. It can be purchased before you travel and you can even check your own data provider’s offer for these devices.

This will be particularly useful when traveling to a country known for cybernetic attacks. Some of them can mimic the Wi-Fi connection in a location and can gain access to your computer, to your personal and work data.

### 2. A burner

Sometimes, the best way to keep your laptop safe is to leave it at home. This way, you can buy a cheap, second hand laptop you would not cry over when lost. If you are going on a business trip, you can only keep the necessary information at hand and you will have something to work on. Should you need some more information from your other computer, you can always ask a trusted person to send you an email with shared documents or files from your personal laptop.

Although it is not a security device per se, in the sense that it does not have a function that protects your laptop when turned on or attached, having a spare laptop can actually save you the headache of losing important data. And this stress-free situation can even be more valuable than the fact that you have easy access to some information.

### 3. A device tracker

This is not a gadget per se, but a software you install on your gadgets to find them. They are a great investment for moments when you are simply stressing about not being able to locate your laptop and it has only been misplaced, and moments when your laptop has actually been stolen.

Depending on the type of system you are getting, it can either locate your device or completely delete everything on it. Technically, this service is good for when the damage has been done and you need to do some damage management.

### A Kensington lock

You might have seen some people leaving their laptops on desks like other people leave their bikes: secured with some sort of cable. That is the Kensington lock. The system is used to secure the laptop shut and to keep it tied to a larger object.

This way, if you are working in a different place instead of your own office, you can still go to the bathroom or leave your laptop unsupervised without being afraid of anyone getting access to your information.

![kensington - 5 Best Gadgets to Keep Your Laptop Safe While Travelling](https://www.voipshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kensington.png "5 Best Gadgets to Keep Your Laptop Safe While Travelling")

### Removable media for important information

Similar to the burner method, another useful way of protecting your data consists of keeping all the more sensitive information on a removable media. This way, you can leave your laptop, but take the hard disk away with you. What is more, this creates a great diversion as anyone looking to steal information will most likely look for the laptop. This way, worst case scenario, the data will be safe.

## Conclusions

Information is now the most valuable thing in the world. No wonder people are trying hard to keep it safe. And although we talked about business information you may have been entrusted with from your work place, your personal information is just as important. Here are the best ways to keep personal stuff away from prying eyes.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
