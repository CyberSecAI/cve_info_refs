Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper handling of MAPI commands within the `EMSMDB32` provider of Microsoft Exchange Server. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the way the `EMSMDB32` provider processes certain, malformed or invalid, MAPI commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper Input Validation: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation or sanitization of MAPI command inputs. This allows a specially crafted command to trigger the vulnerability.
- Denial of Service: The vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition due to the incorrect processing of the malformed MAPI command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, it can cause the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant service and other services that rely on the `EMSMDB32` provider to stop responding. This means that core functions of Exchange, like generating address lists and directory lookups, are disrupted.
- Service Interruption: Services utilizing the `EMSMDB32` provider can become unresponsive, impacting other functionalities tied to the Exchange Server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Network-based Attack: The vulnerability is exploited through a network-based attack by sending a specially crafted MAPI command to the Microsoft Exchange Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Network Access: The attacker needs to have the ability to send a crafted MAPI command to the targeted Exchange Server. The attacker is not required to be authenticated.
- Technical Expertise: The attacker must have knowledge to craft a malicious MAPI command that will trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information**

*   **Affected Components**: The vulnerability affects Microsoft Exchange Server 2000, 2003, and 2007, as well as the Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI Client.
*   **Mitigation**: The vulnerability can only be fully mitigated by patching the Exchange Server.
*   **Workarounds**: Microsoft stated that no workarounds are available for this vulnerability.
*   **Severity**: The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for the Denial of Service impact.
