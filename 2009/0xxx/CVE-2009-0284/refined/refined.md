- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `cat_id` parameter of the `category.php` script in Flax Article Manager 1.1.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the database, data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. They can also potentially gain access to sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. In this specific case, the examples demonstrate the ability to extract the database user and version.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `category.php` using a maliciously constructed `cat_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have knowledge of SQL syntax.
