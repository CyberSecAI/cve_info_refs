Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0311

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the EMC AutoStart Backbone service (ftbackbone.exe).
- The service trusts a DWORD value received from incoming network packets and uses it as a function pointer, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The service directly uses a DWORD value from the network as a function pointer, without proper validation or sanitization. This is a classic example of trusting user-controlled data as code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the received DWORD before using it as a function pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **System Level Access:** The code execution occurs within the context of the SYSTEM user, giving the attacker full control of the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerable service (ftbackbone.exe) listens on TCP port 8042 by default, making it remotely exploitable.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system on TCP port 8042.
- No prior authentication or specialized credentials are required.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2008-08-26 and a coordinated public release occurred on 2009-01-23.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected by a digital vaccine filter with ID ['6412'].
- It is advised to upgrade to EMC AutoStart 5.3 SP2.
