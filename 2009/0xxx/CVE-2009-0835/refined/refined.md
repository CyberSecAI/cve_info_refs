{
  "CVE-2009-0835": {
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of 32-bit syscalls by the seccomp subsystem when running on an x86_64 platform, when CONFIG_SECCOMP is enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The __secure_computing function does not properly handle a 32-bit process making a 64-bit syscall or a 64-bit process making a 32-bit syscall.",
      "The syscall number check can often be fooled on 64-bit aware Linux kernels (x86_64), where the syscall number can map to either the 32-bit or 64-bit syscall table.",
      "Syscall filtering technologies typically make an allow/deny decision based on the syscall number, sometimes arguments, and can be fooled when the syscall tables are different for 32-bit vs. 64-bit."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can bypass intended access restrictions via crafted syscalls that are misinterpreted, allowing for privilege escalation. Specifically, a 32-bit syscall can be misinterpreted as stat or chmod.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local users can exploit this vulnerability by crafting syscalls.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have local access to the system."
