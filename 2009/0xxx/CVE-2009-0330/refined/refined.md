Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0330

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw caused by improper handling of user-supplied input in the `index.php` script of the SCMS (Simple Content Management System) v1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `index.php` script includes files based on the value of the `p` GET parameter without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the vulnerable code is: `include("includes/" . $_GET['p'] . ".txt");`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This can lead to:
  - **Reading sensitive files:** Attackers can read configuration files, source code, or other data that the webserver process has access to.
  - **Code Execution:** If the attacker can upload a malicious file (e.g., a PHP file) to the server, they may be able to execute it by including it via the LFI vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter:** The `p` GET parameter in the `index.php` script is the primary attack vector. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can specify the file they want to include.
- **Null Byte Injection:** The exploit example shows the use of a null byte `%00` after the attacker's input (e.g.,  `http://127.0.0.1/path/index.php?p=[Lfi]%00`). This is a common technique in LFI vulnerabilities to bypass certain file extensions checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and manipulate GET parameters. This vulnerability is considered remote.
-  No specific user authentication or privilege is mentioned in the provided text, implying the attacker does not need to authenticate.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in `index.php` line 34.
- The vulnerable application is SCMS v1, downloadable from `http://futurekast.com/fcms/php/SCMSv1.zip`.
- The exploit was published on January 18, 2009.
