Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0446

**Vulnerable Software:** WEBalbum 2.4b

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `photo.php` script, specifically within the handling of the `id` parameter. This means that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker cannot directly see the results of the query, but they can infer information based on the response length/time. This requires a different approach than traditional SQL injection.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit specifically targets the `login` (username) and `password` fields from the `webalbum_users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on the database structure and privileges of the database user used by the application, further access might be possible for a skilled attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `photo.php` script with a modified `id` parameter containing SQL injection payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques, especially Blind SQL injection.

**Technical Details:**
The provided PHP exploit script works by:
1.  **Determining Baseline:**  First, it calculates the length of the page returned for valid and invalid query parameters to establish a baseline for comparison (`$r`, `$w`, `$t`).
2.  **Length Detection:** It iterates over potential string lengths of the username by testing a character in username, stopping when a different page length is returned.
3.  **Character Extraction:** Then, it uses a binary search approach, using `ascii()` and `substring()` SQL functions, to determine the value of each character of the username and password one by one by comparing response lengths.
