{
  "CVE-2009-0302": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection within the 'Downloads' module of PHP-Nuke.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Blind SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials or other critical data by using time-based blind SQL injection techniques.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote, through HTTP requests to the vulnerable 'Downloads' module by manipulating the 'url' parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. The exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, so it doesn't directly retrieve data from the server response, but instead makes inferences about the data based on the response time."
