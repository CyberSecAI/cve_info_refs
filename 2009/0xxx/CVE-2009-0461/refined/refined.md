  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application uses a cookie named 'adminid' to determine admin status, and it doesn't properly validate or secure this cookie. It appears the admin status can be modified by an attacker.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access by setting the 'adminid' cookie to '8'.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the 'adminid' cookie value via JavaScript.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute Javascript in the context of the vulnerable application's domain. This could be achieved through a malicious link, XSS, or other means of injecting Javascript."
