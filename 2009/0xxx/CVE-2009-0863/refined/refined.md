Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities present in S-CMS 1.1 Stable:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The login mechanism sets a cookie named "login" with a static value "OK" upon successful authentication. This cookie is then used to determine if a user is logged in, without proper validation or security measures.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `delete_page.php` script uses unsanitized input from the `id` parameter in a SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By manually setting the `login` cookie to "OK" with a Javascript command, an attacker can bypass the authentication process without providing valid credentials.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `delete_page.php` script allows SQL injection through the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel by simply setting a cookie.
*   **Mass Page Deletion:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in `delete_page.php` to delete arbitrary pages/content from the site database, causing damage or data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker can manually set the `login` cookie to "OK" through JavaScript in the browser or using other methods.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The SQL injection vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to `delete_page.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and manipulate cookies in their browser. No prior authentication is required due to the authentication bypass vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `delete_page.php` script and be able to craft a malicious GET request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit code provided demonstrates how to set the cookie using JavaScript and how to craft a SQL injection payload.
*   The content confirms the presence of multiple vulnerabilities (Insecure Cookie Handling and SQL Injection)
*   The content provides more details than the typical CVE description, including the specific code snippets vulnerable to the flaws.
*  The content references both CVE-2009-0863 and CVE-2009-0864.  Since this content describes both vulnerabilities, we cannot separate the information for these CVEs, though this response is for CVE-2009-0863.
