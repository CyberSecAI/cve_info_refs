    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `profile.php` file within the PHPAuctionSystem application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "SQL Injection (SQLi)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords of administrators. The XSS vulnerability enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to vulnerable `profile.php` endpoint.",
        "User ID parameter manipulation."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No user authentication is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities. The attacker can manipulate the `user_id` parameter in the `profile.php` file, injecting malicious SQL queries or XSS payloads through the URL."
