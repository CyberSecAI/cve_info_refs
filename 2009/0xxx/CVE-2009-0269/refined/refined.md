{
  "CVE-2009-0269": {
    "description": "The eCryptfs subsystem in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service (fault or memory corruption), or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a readlink call that results in an error, leading to use of a -1 return value as an array index.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ecryptfs_follow_link` function in `fs/ecryptfs/inode.c` does not properly handle error returns from the `readlink` system call. Specifically, it uses the return value of `readlink` as an index into a buffer without verifying that the return value is not an error. When `readlink` returns an error (a negative value), this negative value is used as an out-of-bounds array index, leading to a fault or memory corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper error handling",
        "Out-of-bounds write"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can trigger a denial of service (fault or memory corruption). The issue could also lead to other unspecified impacts (likely memory corruption, potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution, though not explicitly stated in the sources).",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to be able to trigger a `readlink` call on an eCryptfs mount that returns an error.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker must have the ability to interact with the file system and cause the `readlink` to return an error, for example, via an invalid path or a permission issue.  A write access on the ecryptfs is mentioned in Ubuntu's report."
