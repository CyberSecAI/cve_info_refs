Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-0199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the VMnc media codec, specifically how it handles framebuffer parameters. Incorrect parameters in a specially crafted video file can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A memory corruption vulnerability where data is written past the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could lead to unspecified security issues. The advisory notes that it can cause heap-based buffer overflows and doesn't go into further details about the nature of the impact, but typically a buffer overflow can lead to denial of service, arbitrary code execution or other security compromises.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Video Files:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by creating and distributing malicious video files containing crafted framebuffer parameters.
*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Users can be tricked into visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability by playing the crafted video file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers need to be able to deliver the malicious video file to a system with the vulnerable version of the VMnc codec installed. This could be through social engineering or by hosting on malicious websites, or sending as email attachments.
*   The attacker does not need access to the vulnerable system, other than being able to get the user to load the malicious video file or visit a malicious website where the file gets played.

**Affected Products:**
* VMware Workstation Movie Decoder stand alone 6.5.2 and earlier.
* VMware Workstation 6.5.2 and earlier,
* VMware Player 2.5.2 and earlier,
* VMware ACE 2.5.2 and earlier

**Mitigation:**
* Applying the patches provided for the vulnerable versions of the affected products.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research and Will Dormann of the CERT/CC.
*   The advisory mentions CVE-2009-2628 being related to the same issue and the same remediation steps resolve both vulnerabilities.
