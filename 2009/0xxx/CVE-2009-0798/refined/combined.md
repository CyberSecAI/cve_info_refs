| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=494443#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-04-06 21:23:56 UTC  ``` A flaw in how the acpid daemon handles error conditions can force the daemon into an infinite loop by not closing open UNIX sockets, even if the other end of the socket is closed.  If an attacker were to exhaust the number of available sockets open to acpid, too many files would be open and the daemon will enter an infinite loop, consuming a large amount of CPU and blocking legitimate processes from communicating with acpid.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=494443#c4)  Vincent Danen    2009-04-08 17:35:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 338766](attachment.cgi?id=338766&action=diff "original upstream patch that fixes the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=338766&action=edit "original upstream patch that fixes the issue") original upstream patch that fixes the issue   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=494443#c8)  Vincent Danen    2009-04-21 18:07:04 UTC  ``` Embargo is lifted.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=494443#c9)  Vincent Danen    2009-04-22 18:41:04 UTC  ``` Upstream has released 1.0.10 which contains the fix for this issue.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=494443#c10)  Vincent Danen    2009-04-22 21:21:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 340826](attachment.cgi?id=340826&action=diff "upstream patch used for 1.1.10 to fix CVE-2009-0798") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=340826&action=edit "upstream patch used for 1.1.10 to fix CVE-2009-0798") upstream patch used for 1.1.10 to fix [CVE-2009-0798](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0798)  The patch is slightly different from upstream than what they initially provided us, so we should base our updates on this patch instead.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=494443#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-05-07 11:59:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0474 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0474.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=494443#c13)  Red Hat Product Security    2009-06-16 07:09:13 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0474.html>  Fedora:   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F10/FEDORA-2009-5578>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F9/FEDORA-2009-5608>   ``` |  |

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1786-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Steffen Joeris
May 02, 2009                          <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : acpid
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-0798

It was discovered that acpid, a daemon for delivering ACPI events, is
prone to a denial of service attack by opening a large number of UNIX
sockets, which are not closed properly.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.8-1lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-5etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# acpid: Denial of service — GLSA **200905-06**

An error in acpid might allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of
Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-power/acpid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.10** |

### Background

acpid is a daemon for the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
(ACPI).

### Description

closing them, triggering an infinite loop.

### Impact

Remote attackers can cause a Denial of Service (CPU consumption and
connectivity loss).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All acpid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-power/acpid-1.0.10"
```
