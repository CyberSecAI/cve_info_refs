Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a signedness error in the way Apple QuickTime handles movie data encoded with the Cinepak Video Codec. Specifically, the issue occurs when parsing data within the MDAT atom of the movie file. This signedness error leads to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow:  A signedness error during the parsing of movie data using the Cinepak codec leads to a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running QuickTime.
- Application termination: The vulnerability could also lead to an unexpected application termination (denial of service)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted movie file: The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted movie file containing malicious Cinepak encoded data.
- User interaction: The victim is required to open the malicious movie file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious movie file.
- The attacker must lure a user to open the crafted movie file using Quicktime.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in QuickTime 7.6.
- The vulnerability was discovered by an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '6172'.
