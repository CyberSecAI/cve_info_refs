```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection via the 'forumID' parameter in the `forumhop.php` script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL injection.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user passwords. In this case the exploit extracts user passwords using a time based method.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET request to `forumhop.php` with a crafted `forumID` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
