  "CVE-2009-0094": {
    "description": "A man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability exists in Windows WINS servers. This vulnerability could allow a remote authenticated attacker to spoof a web proxy and thereby redirect Internet traffic to an address of the attackerâs choice.",
    "root_cause": "The Windows WINS server does not correctly validate who can register WPAD or ISATAP entries on the WINS server. By default a WINS server will allow any user to create a registration in the WINS database for WPAD or ISATAP if the name registration does not already exist.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Spoofing"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who has successfully exploited this vulnerability could spoof the legitimate web proxy or ISATAP route and intercept or redirect Internet traffic.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote",
      "Authenticated"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be authenticated to the network and have the ability to register WPAD or ISATAP entries in the WINS database. The attacker also needs to control an IP address to redirect traffic to."
