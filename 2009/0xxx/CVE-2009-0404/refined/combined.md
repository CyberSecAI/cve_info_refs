  SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library

  libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.
  libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API. libjpeg-turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.

  [### SWIG](/projects/swig/)

  A code generator for connecting C/C++ with other programming languages

  SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language, Java, Lua, OCaml, Octave, R and Scilab. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML.

## Open Source Software Development Software Guide

Open source software development is a type of software which is published under an open source license, and its source code made available for free to the public. Open source projects typically involve the collaboration of developers from around the world who are able to freely modify, improve, and build upon each other's work. This creates unique opportunities for developers to share their knowledge and skills with each other while increasing their collective expertise.

The main benefits of open source software development include enhanced flexibility, speed of development, greater freedom to adjust and customize code, broader reach with users, better quality control and reliability through community input, improved collaboration between different teams or organizations working on related tasks/projects, more cost-effective access to technology infrastructure as no need to purchase expensive commercial licenses. Additionally there is usually an increased support from peers in dealing with technical issues or compatibility problems stemming from different versions or non-standard implementations. For example when something doesn't work as expected someone can post on a public forum about it or dig into the project’s issue tracker for help from other contributors.

Open source projects are also highly organized, often following some form of hierarchical structure; making them easier for new users or software developers wanting to contribute quickly familiarize themselves with task being taken by others in the group along with finding areas where they can be most useful in order provide valuable assistance & feedback. In addition due to large number of potential participants contributing towards same goal (and competing against one another) rewards such as reputation points & leaderboard rankings become quite common which help encourage people stay active within communities & ensure much higher level engagement than other collaborative platforms like forums/chat rooms etc. Last but not least many open sourced projects have dedicated “code review” teams that conduct regular audits over programming logic & coding standards thus ensuring highest possible degree accuracy before any proposed changes make it into mainline version of product.

In short, open source software development offers numerous advantages over traditional closed-source solutions allowing those involved reap benefit both professionanly & personally through enhanced learning opportunity potential partnerships created during process itself.

## Features of Open Source Software Development Software

Open Source Software Development Software provides a variety of features that can be used to create, customize and manage software projects. These features include:

* **Version Control:** This feature allows developers to have full control over the changes made in their code. It helps them to keep track of all versions of their project and make sure that they are always up-to-date.
* **Debugging Tools:** Debugging tools provide an easy way for developers to identify errors in their code. This helps them quickly find and fix issues before they become major problems.
* **Automation Systems:** Automation systems are used to automate tasks such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, thus reducing the time spent on mundane tasks.
* **Documentation Generator:** Many open source software development tools come with a documentation generator which creates comprehensive documentation for each project automatically. This makes it easier for developers to understand how the code works without having to spend too much time reading through it manually.
* **Collaboration Features:** Open source software development tools usually include collaboration features which allow teams from multiple locations or organizations work together effectively on a single project. Some of these features include shared repositories, bug tracking systems, and discussion boards where team members can communicate with each other easily about their projects.
* **Security Controls:** Open source software development tools come with various security controls to protect projects from malicious attacks. These include firewalls, encryption technology, and access controls which can be used to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the project.

## Types of Open Source Software Development Software

* **Collaborative Software:** This type of open source software development allows multiple users to work collaboratively on a single project from different locations. Features such as version control, task management, code review and bug tracking are commonly included in these types of software.
* **Community-Based Development Models:** These open source development models rely heavily on the community for support and input into the design process. This can include forums, mailing lists, IRC channels or other forms of online collaboration where developers can share ideas and discuss how to improve the product over time.
* **Forked Projects:** A fork occurs when one developer creates their own version of an existing project by taking its code base and making modifications that they believe will improve it or make it more suitable for their needs. Other developers may then choose to further modify this “forked” version or create related projects based off of it.
* **Custom Software Solutions:** Open source software allows companies or individuals to customize programs to meet their specific needs without having to build everything from scratch. By using existing components developed by others, creating custom solutions becomes much easier than starting from nothing.
* **Mobile Platforms:** Open source mobile platforms like Android and Fire OS allow anyone with coding knowledge to develop applications for those operating systems relatively easily compared to closed source platforms like iOS or Windows Phone. These platforms have also grown in popularity due to their low cost and ease of use.
* **Cloud-Based Development:** Open source software that is built on top of cloud services provides developers with the ability to easily access data from any location, deploy applications quickly and manage them remotely. This type of development has become increasingly popular for its scalability and cost effectiveness.

## Open Source Software Development Software Advantages

* **Cost-Effective:** Unlike proprietary software, open source software development is free. There are no expensive license fees to pay or ongoing costs associated with using the software. This cost savings can be a major advantage for businesses and individuals alike.
* **Widely Available:** Open source software development is widely available online and can often be downloaded without any restrictions. This makes it easy to access wherever you are located and from whichever device you’re using.
* **Flexible:** The flexibility of open source software allows for easier customization according to user needs. With the use of different programming languages, developers can make adjustments that fit the specific requirements of their project more easily than with proprietary programs.
* **Reliability:** Since open source projects have multiple contributors working on them simultaneously, bugs tend to get discovered quickly, allowing them to be fixed faster than those in proprietary programs. The code is also considered “open source” meaning anyone has the ability to review it for any potential issues that may arise in the future.
* **Security:** Open Source projects benefit from having many individuals look at their code which means there’s less likely it will contain a harmful backdoor created by a malicious hacker or developer. Additionally, since developers have access to the underlying code they can make sure that weaknesses aren't present in it or spot any potential flaws before someone else does and takes advantage of them.
* **Support Community:** Due to its wide availability, there are large communities available online where users can ask questions about how something works or how best interact with open source software development platforms. Similarly, as these communities grow so do the support resources available which provides an always accessible pool of knowledge should you ever need help with anything related to coding in general (not just with your project).
* **Innovation:** Open source software development encourages innovation and collaboration on a global level. By encouraging developers all over the world to work together, more ideas can be created, implemented, tested and improved upon faster than with proprietary programs. This allows for projects that would normally require a large team of developers to move forward at a much faster rate.

## How Users Can Get Started With Open Source Software Development Software

Getting started with open source software development is relatively straightforward. The first step is to decide which type of open source software you want to use. There are a variety of open source programs available, ranging from simple word processors and image editors to more complex programming environments like Java or C++. Once you have selected the software you want to use, the next step is to download it. You can usually find these downloads on the website for the open source software project, or by searching an online repository.

Once your download is complete, install it on your computer just like any other program. Most open source projects provide either a graphical installation wizard that walks users through setting up the program, or clear instructions on how to manually set it up in the Readme file that comes with the download. After you’ve installed the program and opened it up for the first time, read any introductory tutorials that are provided by either community members or included in program documentation. This will help you quickly become familiar with how everything works and how to get started using it effectively before diving into more complicated tasks.

Finally, if you ever run into problems while working with an open source application, don't hesitate to reach out for help. Many projects have active discussion forums where people answer questions related to installing and using their software so if something isn't working properly or you can't figure out how to do something specific, feel free to search around and see if there's already an answer available. If not, you can also post your own question in the discussion and wait for one of the more experienced users to respond. With a little bit of searching and experimentation, you can soon be up and running with open source software development.

  [### libjpeg-turbo](/projects/libjpeg-turbo/)

  SIMD-accelerated libjpeg-compatible JPEG codec library

  libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.
  libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API. libjpeg-turbo also features colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java interface.

  [### SWIG](/projects/swig/)

  A code generator for connecting C/C++ with other programming languages

  SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl and Ruby. The list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, D, Go language, Java, Lua, OCaml, Octave, R and Scilab. Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Guile, MzScheme/Racket) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML.

## Open Source Software Development Software Guide

Open source software development is a type of software which is published under an open source license, and its source code made available for free to the public. Open source projects typically involve the collaboration of developers from around the world who are able to freely modify, improve, and build upon each other's work. This creates unique opportunities for developers to share their knowledge and skills with each other while increasing their collective expertise.

The main benefits of open source software development include enhanced flexibility, speed of development, greater freedom to adjust and customize code, broader reach with users, better quality control and reliability through community input, improved collaboration between different teams or organizations working on related tasks/projects, more cost-effective access to technology infrastructure as no need to purchase expensive commercial licenses. Additionally there is usually an increased support from peers in dealing with technical issues or compatibility problems stemming from different versions or non-standard implementations. For example when something doesn't work as expected someone can post on a public forum about it or dig into the project’s issue tracker for help from other contributors.

Open source projects are also highly organized, often following some form of hierarchical structure; making them easier for new users or software developers wanting to contribute quickly familiarize themselves with task being taken by others in the group along with finding areas where they can be most useful in order provide valuable assistance & feedback. In addition due to large number of potential participants contributing towards same goal (and competing against one another) rewards such as reputation points & leaderboard rankings become quite common which help encourage people stay active within communities & ensure much higher level engagement than other collaborative platforms like forums/chat rooms etc. Last but not least many open sourced projects have dedicated “code review” teams that conduct regular audits over programming logic & coding standards thus ensuring highest possible degree accuracy before any proposed changes make it into mainline version of product.

In short, open source software development offers numerous advantages over traditional closed-source solutions allowing those involved reap benefit both professionanly & personally through enhanced learning opportunity potential partnerships created during process itself.

## Features of Open Source Software Development Software

Open Source Software Development Software provides a variety of features that can be used to create, customize and manage software projects. These features include:

* **Version Control:** This feature allows developers to have full control over the changes made in their code. It helps them to keep track of all versions of their project and make sure that they are always up-to-date.
* **Debugging Tools:** Debugging tools provide an easy way for developers to identify errors in their code. This helps them quickly find and fix issues before they become major problems.
* **Automation Systems:** Automation systems are used to automate tasks such as testing, deployment, and monitoring, thus reducing the time spent on mundane tasks.
* **Documentation Generator:** Many open source software development tools come with a documentation generator which creates comprehensive documentation for each project automatically. This makes it easier for developers to understand how the code works without having to spend too much time reading through it manually.
* **Collaboration Features:** Open source software development tools usually include collaboration features which allow teams from multiple locations or organizations work together effectively on a single project. Some of these features include shared repositories, bug tracking systems, and discussion boards where team members can communicate with each other easily about their projects.
* **Security Controls:** Open source software development tools come with various security controls to protect projects from malicious attacks. These include firewalls, encryption technology, and access controls which can be used to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the project.

## Types of Open Source Software Development Software

* **Collaborative Software:** This type of open source software development allows multiple users to work collaboratively on a single project from different locations. Features such as version control, task management, code review and bug tracking are commonly included in these types of software.
* **Community-Based Development Models:** These open source development models rely heavily on the community for support and input into the design process. This can include forums, mailing lists, IRC channels or other forms of online collaboration where developers can share ideas and discuss how to improve the product over time.
* **Forked Projects:** A fork occurs when one developer creates their own version of an existing project by taking its code base and making modifications that they believe will improve it or make it more suitable for their needs. Other developers may then choose to further modify this “forked” version or create related projects based off of it.
* **Custom Software Solutions:** Open source software allows companies or individuals to customize programs to meet their specific needs without having to build everything from scratch. By using existing components developed by others, creating custom solutions becomes much easier than starting from nothing.
* **Mobile Platforms:** Open source mobile platforms like Android and Fire OS allow anyone with coding knowledge to develop applications for those operating systems relatively easily compared to closed source platforms like iOS or Windows Phone. These platforms have also grown in popularity due to their low cost and ease of use.
* **Cloud-Based Development:** Open source software that is built on top of cloud services provides developers with the ability to easily access data from any location, deploy applications quickly and manage them remotely. This type of development has become increasingly popular for its scalability and cost effectiveness.

## Open Source Software Development Software Advantages

* **Cost-Effective:** Unlike proprietary software, open source software development is free. There are no expensive license fees to pay or ongoing costs associated with using the software. This cost savings can be a major advantage for businesses and individuals alike.
* **Widely Available:** Open source software development is widely available online and can often be downloaded without any restrictions. This makes it easy to access wherever you are located and from whichever device you’re using.
* **Flexible:** The flexibility of open source software allows for easier customization according to user needs. With the use of different programming languages, developers can make adjustments that fit the specific requirements of their project more easily than with proprietary programs.
* **Reliability:** Since open source projects have multiple contributors working on them simultaneously, bugs tend to get discovered quickly, allowing them to be fixed faster than those in proprietary programs. The code is also considered “open source” meaning anyone has the ability to review it for any potential issues that may arise in the future.
* **Security:** Open Source projects benefit from having many individuals look at their code which means there’s less likely it will contain a harmful backdoor created by a malicious hacker or developer. Additionally, since developers have access to the underlying code they can make sure that weaknesses aren't present in it or spot any potential flaws before someone else does and takes advantage of them.
* **Support Community:** Due to its wide availability, there are large communities available online where users can ask questions about how something works or how best interact with open source software development platforms. Similarly, as these communities grow so do the support resources available which provides an always accessible pool of knowledge should you ever need help with anything related to coding in general (not just with your project).
* **Innovation:** Open source software development encourages innovation and collaboration on a global level. By encouraging developers all over the world to work together, more ideas can be created, implemented, tested and improved upon faster than with proprietary programs. This allows for projects that would normally require a large team of developers to move forward at a much faster rate.

## Types of Users That Use Open Source Software Development Software

* **Beginner Users:** Users new to open source software development, who are looking to explore and learn the basic principles of computer programming.
* **Experienced Developers:** Individuals with coding experience, who use open source software development tools as part of their daily workflows. They have a thorough understanding of the fundamentals and may modify existing code or create new programs from scratch.
* **Hobbyists:** People who enjoy tinkering with open source software in their spare time, often without having any formal training in Computer Science or Software Engineering.
* **Professional Programmers:** Those professionals whose job involves using open source software development on a regular basis. They are typically highly skilled and experienced developers writing custom solutions for clients or working on projects within corporate IT departments.
* **Corporate IT Departments:** Teams of individuals responsible for planning, developing and maintaining large-scale corporate networks and systems, who rely heavily on open source software development tools to customize solutions that fit into their organization’s infrastructure.
* **Designers:** Professionals tasked with the visual layout of software applications, who use open source tools to create aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.

## How Much Does Open Source Software Development Software Cost?

Open source software development software is typically offered for free and can provide a high quality solution without any cost. The true cost of open source software development often comes in the form of additional resources needed to deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot the system. Without developers with sufficient expertise working on the project, costly mistakes or delays can result. Free online tutorials, forums, and support from other users are available to help address any issues that may arise during use. Additionally, some open source projects may require proprietary components such as web servers or database programs that must be purchased separately from third party vendors.

Overall, while there is no direct financial cost associated with using most open source software development platforms, there may be hidden costs related to the time taken to access community support or purchase necessary supplementary products that could add up over time.

## What Software Does Open Source Software Development Software Integrate With?

Open source software development software can integrate with various types of software such as code editors, version control systems, and bug tracking tools. Editors like Visual Studio Code allow developers to edit the code of open source projects while also providing the ability to access extensions and connect with other cloud-based services. Version control systems, like Git, offer developers a central repository for managing files within their project in a distributed environment. Tools such as Jira provide bug tracking capabilities which enable collaboration among team members as well as data visualization aids in debugging. Additionally, integrated development environments (IDEs) like Eclipse allow for easier navigation when developing open source projects by providing an all-inclusive user interface for creating applications. All of these types of software are capable of integrating with open source software development software to create an efficient and effective workflow.

## Trends Related to Open Source Software Development Software

## How Users Can Get Started With Open Source Software Development Software

Getting started with open source software development is relatively straightforward. The first step is to decide which type of open source software you want to use. There are a variety of open source programs available, ranging from simple word processors and image editors to more complex programming environments like Java or C++. Once you have selected the software you want to use, the next step is to download it. You can usually find these downloads on the website for the open source software project, or by searching an online repository.

Once your download is complete, install it on your computer just like any other program. Most open source projects provide either a graphical installation wizard that walks users through setting up the program, or clear instructions on how to manually set it up in the Readme file that comes with the download. After you’ve installed the program and opened it up for the first time, read any introductory tutorials that are provided by either community members or included in program documentation. This will help you quickly become familiar with how everything works and how to get started using it effectively before diving into more complicated tasks.

Finally, if you ever run into problems while working with an open source application, don't hesitate to reach out for help. Many projects have active discussion forums where people answer questions related to installing and using their software so if something isn't working properly or you can't figure out how to do something specific, feel free to search around and see if there's already an answer available. If not, you can also post your own question in the discussion and wait for one of the more experienced users to respond. With a little bit of searching and experimentation, you can soon be up and running with open source software development.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## 1  About htmLawed

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed is a PHP script to process text with HTML markup to make it more compliant with HTML standards and with administrative policies. It works by making HTML well-formed with balanced and properly nested tags, neutralizing code that introduces a security vulnerability or is used for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing only specified HTML tags and attributes, and so on. Such *lawing in* of HTML code ensures that it is in accordance with the aesthetics, safety and usability requirements set by administrators.

  htmLawed is highly customizable, and fast with low memory usage. Its free and open-source code is in one small file. It does not require extensions or libraries, and works in older versions of PHP as well. It is a good alternative to the HTML [Tidy](http://tidy.sourceforge.net) application.

### 1.1  Example uses

[(to top)](#peak)

  \*  Filtering of text submitted as comments on blogs to allow only certain HTML elements

  \*  Making RSS newsfeed items standard-compliant: often one uses an excerpt from an HTML document for the content, and with unbalanced tags, non-numerical entities, etc., such excerpts may not be XML-compliant

  \*  Beautifying or pretty-printing HTML code

  \*  Text processing for stricter XML standard-compliance: e.g., to have lowercased x in hexadecimal numeric entities becomes necessary if an HTML document with MathML content needs to be served as application/xml

  \*  Scraping text from web-pages

  \*  Transforming an HTML element to another

### 1.3  History

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed was created in 2007 for use with LabWiki, a wiki software developed at PHP Labware, as a suitable software could not be found. Existing PHP software like Kses and HTMLPurifier were deemed inadequate, slow, resource-intensive, or dependent on an extension or external application like HTML Tidy. The core logic of htmLawed, that of identifying HTML elements and attributes, was based on the Kses (version 0.2.2) HTML filter software of Ulf Harnhammar (it can still be used with code that uses Kses; see [section 2.6](#s2.6).). Support for HTML version 5 was added in May 2013 in a beta and in February 2017 in a production release.

  See [section 4.3](#s4.3) for a detailed log of changes in htmLawed over the years, and [section 4.10](#s4.10) for acknowledgements.

### 1.6  Availability

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed can be downloaded for free at its [website](https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed). Besides the htmLawed.php file, the download has the htmLawed documentation (this document) in plain [text](htmLawed_README.txt) and [HTML](htmLawed_README.htm) formats, a script for [testing](htmLawedTest.php), and a text file for [test-cases](htmLawed_TESTCASE.txt). htmLawed can be installed with Composer, and is also available as a PHP class (OOP code) âÂ see the [website](https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed). Official htmLawed releases are also put up on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlawed/).

## 2  Usage

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed works in PHP version 4.4 or higher. Either include() the htmLawed.php file, or copy-paste the entire code.

  To use with PHP 4.3, have the following code included:

`if(!function_exists('ctype_digit')){`

`function ctype_digit($var){`

`return ((int) $var == $var);`

`}`

`}`

### 2.1  Simple

[(to top)](#peak)

  The input text to be processed, $text, is passed as an argument of type string; htmLawed() returns the processed string:

`$processed = htmLawed($text);`

  With the htmLawed class ([section 1.6](#s1.6)), usage is:

`$processed = htmLawed::hl($text);`

  **Notes**: (1) If input is from a $\_GET or $\_POST value, and magic quotes are enabled on the PHP setup, run stripslashes() on the input before passing to htmLawed. (2) htmLawed does not have support for head-level elements, body, and the frame-level elements, frameset, frame and noframes.

  By default, htmLawed will process the text allowing all valid HTML elements/tags and commonly used URL schemes and CSS style properties. It will allow Javascript code, CDATA sections and HTML comments, balance tags, and ensure proper nesting of elements. Such actions can be configured using two other optional arguments -- $config and $spec:

`$processed = htmLawed($text, $config, $spec);`

  The $config and $spec arguments are detailed below. Some examples are shown in [section 2.9](#s2.9). For maximum protection against XSS and other security vulnerabilities, consider using the safe parameter; see [section 3.6](#s3.6).

### 2.2  Configuring htmLawed using the $config argument

[(to top)](#peak)

  $config instructs htmLawed on how to tackle certain tasks. When $config is not specified, or not set as an array (e.g., $config = 1), htmLawed will take default actions. One or many of the task-action or parameter-value pairs can be specified in $config as array key-value pairs. If a parameter is not specified, htmLawed will use the default value for it, indicated further below. In PHP code, parameter values that are integers should not be quoted and should be used as numeric types (unless meant as string/text). Thus, for instance:

`$config = array('comment'=>0, 'cdata'=>1, 'elements'=>'a, b, strong');`

`$processed = htmLawed($text, $config);`

  Below are the various parameters that can be specified in $config.

  Key: \* default, ^ different from htmLawed versions below 1.2, ~ different default when valid\_xhtml is set to 1 (see [section 3.5](#s3.5)), " different default when safe is set to 1 (see [section 3.6](#s3.6))

### 2.3  Extra HTML specifications using the $spec parameter

[(to top)](#peak)

  The $spec argument of htmLawed can be used to disallow an otherwise legal attribute for an element, or to restrict the attribute's values. This can also be helpful as a security measure (e.g., in certain versions of browsers, certain values can cause buffer overflows and denial of service attacks), or in enforcing admin policies. $spec is specified as a string of text containing one or more *rules*, with multiple rules separated from each other by a semi-colon (;). E.g.,

`$spec = 'i=-*; td, tr=style, id, -*; a=id(match="/[a-z][a-z\d.:\-`"]*/i"/minval=2), href(maxlen=100/minlen=34); img=-width,-alt';`

`$processed = htmLawed($text, $config, $spec);`

  Or,

`$processed = htmLawed($text, $config, 'i=-*; td, tr=style, id, -*; a=id(match="/[a-z][a-z\d.:\-`"]*/i"/minval=2), href(maxlen=100/minlen=34); img=-width,-alt');`

  A rule begins with an HTML **element** name(s) (*rule-element*), for which the rule applies, followed by an equal-to (=) sign. A rule-element may represent multiple elements if comma (,)-separated element names are used. E.g., th,td,tr=.

  Rest of the rule consists of comma-separated HTML **attribute names**, which can be the wildcard references \*, aria\*, data\*, and on\* for the sets of all standard, Aria, data-\*, and event (on\*) attributes, respectively. A minus (-) character before an attribute means that the attribute is not permitted inside the rule-element. E.g., -width. To deny all attributes, -\* can be used. All Aria, data-\*, and event (on\*) attributes can similarly be denined using aria\*, data\*, and on\*, respectively.

  Following shows examples of rule excerpts with rule-element a and the attributes that are being permitted:

  \*  a= - all

  \*  a=id - all

  \*  a=href, title, -id, -onclick - all except id and onclick

  \*  a=\*, id, -id - all except id

  \*  a=-\* - none

  \*  a=-\*, href, title - none except href and title

  \*  a=-\*, -id, href, title - none except href and title

  \*  a=-on\*, -id, href, onclick, title - all except id and on\* other than onclick

  Rules regarding **attribute values** are optionally specified inside round brackets after attribute names â which cannot be wildcard references like \* or data\* â in solidus (/)-separated *parameter = value* pairs. E.g., title(maxlen=30/minlen=5). None or one or more of the following parameters may be specified:

  \*  oneof - one or more choices separated by | that the value should match; if only one choice is provided, then the value must match that choice; matching is case-sensitive

  \*  noneof - one or more choices separated by | that the value should not match; matching is case-sensitive

  \*  maxlen and minlen - upper and lower limits for the number of characters in the attribute value; specified in numbers

  \*  maxval and minval - upper and lower limits for the numerical value specified in the attribute value; specified in numbers

  \*  match and nomatch - pattern that the attribute value should or should not match; specified as PHP/PCRE-compatible regular expressions with delimiters and possibly modifiers (e.g., to specify case-sensitivity for matching)

  \*  default - a value to force on the attribute if the value provided by the writer does not fit any of the specified parameters

  If default is not set and the attribute value does not satisfy any of the specified parameters, then the attribute is removed. The default value can also be used to force all attribute declarations to take the same value (by getting the values declared illegal by setting, e.g., maxlen to -1).

  Examples with *input* <input title="WIDTH" value="10em" /><input title="length" value="5" class="ic1 ic2" /> are shown below.

  *Rule*: input=title(maxlen=60/minlen=6), value

  *Output*: <input value="10em" /><input title="length" value="5" class="ic1 ic2" />

  *Rule*: input=title(), value(maxval=8/default=6)

  *Output*: <input title="WIDTH" value="6" /><input title="length" value="5" class="ic1 ic2" />

  *Rule*: input=title(nomatch=%w.d%i), value(match=%em%/default=6em)

  *Output*: <input value="10em" /><input title="length" value="6em" class="ic1 ic2" />

  *Rule*: input=class(noneof=ic2|ic3/oneof=ic1|ic4), title(oneof=height|depth/default=depth), value(noneof=5|6)

  *Output*: <input title="depth" value="10em" /><input title="depth" class="ic1" />

  **Special characters**: The characters ;, ,, /, (, ), |, ~ and space have special meanings in the rules. Words in the rules that use such characters, or the characters themselves, should be *escaped* by enclosing in pairs of double-quotes ("). A back-tick (`) can be used to escape a literal ". An example rule illustrating this is input=value(maxlen=30/match="/^\w/"/default="your `"ID`"").

  **Attributes that accept multiple values**: If an attribute is accesskey, class, itemtype or rel, or archive in case of object element, which can have multiple, space-separated values, or archive in case of object element and srcset, which can have multiple, comma-separated values, htmLawed will parse the attribute value for such multiple values and will individually test each of them. The parsing is performed after any URL assessment of the attribute values ([section 3.4.3](#s3.4.3)).

  **Note**: To deny an attribute for all elements for which it is legal, $config["deny\_attribute"] (see [section 3.4](#s3.4)) can be used instead of $spec. Also, attributes can be allowed element-specifically through $spec while being denied globally through $config["deny\_attribute"]. The hook\_tag parameter ([section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)) can also be possibly used to implement a functionality like that achieved using $spec functionality.

  **Note**: Attributes permitted through $spec are permitted regardless of any denial through $config. An attribute for which $spec indicates both permission and denial will be permitted. E.g., onclick with $spec value of a = \*, -onclick, onclick, a = -on\*, onclick or a = on\*, -onclick will be permitted inside a.

  **Note**: Attributes' specifications for an element may be (inadvertently) set through multiple rules. In case of conflict, the attribute specification in the first rule will get precedence.

  $spec can also be used to permit **custom or non-standard attributes**. Thus, the following value of $spec will permit the custom uses of the standard rel attribute in input (not permitted as per standards) and of a non-standard attribute, vFlag, in img.

`$spec = 'img=vFlag; input=rel'`

  The attribute names must begin with an alphabet and cannot have space, equal-to (=) and solidus (/) characters.

### 2.4  Performance time & memory usage

[(to top)](#peak)

  The time and memory consumed during text processing by htmLawed depends on its configuration, the size of the input, and the amount, nestedness and well-formedness of the HTML markup within the input. In particular, tag balancing and beautification each can increase the processing time by about a quarter.

  The htmLawed [demo](htmLawedTest.php) can be used to evaluate the performance and effects of different types of input and $config.

### 2.5  Some security risks to keep in mind

[(to top)](#peak)

  When setting the parameters/arguments (like those to allow certain HTML elements) for use with htmLawed, one should bear in mind that the setting may let through potentially *dangerous* HTML code which is meant to steal user-data, deface a website, render a page non-functional, etc. Unless end-users, either people or software, supplying the content are completely trusted, security issues arising from the degree of HTML usage permitted through htmLawed's setting should be considered. For example, following increase security risks:

  \*  Allowing script, applet, embed, iframe, canvas, audio, video, dialog or object elements, or certain of their attributes like allowscriptaccess

  \*  Allowing HTML comments (some Internet Explorer versions are vulnerable with, e.g., <!--[if gte IE 4]><script>alert("xss");</script><![endif]-->

  \*  Allowing dynamic CSS expressions (some Internet Explorer versions are vulnerable)

  \*  Allowing the style attribute

  To remove *unsecure* HTML, code-developers using htmLawed must set $config appropriately. E.g., $config["elements"] = "\* -script" to deny the script element ([section 3.3](#s3.3)), $config["safe"] = 1 to auto-configure ceratin htmLawed parameters for maximizing security ([section 3.6](#s3.6)), etc.

  Permitting the \*style\* attribute brings in risks of *click-jacking*, *phishing*, web-page overlays, etc., *even* when the safe parameter is enabled (see [section 3.6](#s3.6)). Except for URLs and a few other things like CSS dynamic expressions, htmLawed currently does not check every CSS style property. It does provide ways for the code-developer implementing htmLawed to do such checks through htmLawed's $spec argument, and through the hook\_tag parameter (see [section 3.4.8](#s3.4.8) for more). Disallowing style completely and relying on CSS classes and stylesheet files is recommended.

  htmLawed does not check or correct the character **encoding** of the input it receives. In conjunction with permissive circumstances, such as when the character encoding is left undefined through HTTP headers or HTML meta tags, this can allow for an exploit (like Google's *UTF-7/XSS* vulnerability of the past).

  Ocassionally, though very rarely, the default settings with which htmLawed runs may change between different versions of htmLawed. Admins should keep this in mind when upgrading htmLawed. Important changes in htmLawed's default behavior in new releases of the software are noted in [section 4.5](#s4.5) on upgrades.

### 2.6  Use with kses() code

[(to top)](#peak)

  The Kses PHP script for HTML filtering is used by many applications (like WordPress, as in year 2012). It is possible to have such applications use htmLawed instead, since it is compatible with code that calls the kses() function declared in the Kses file (usually named kses.php). E.g., application code like this will continue to work after replacing Kses with htmLawed:

`$comment_filtered = kses($comment_input, array('a'=>array(), 'b'=>array(), 'i'=>array()));`

  If the application uses a Kses file that has the kses() function declared, then, to have the application use htmLawed instead of Kses, rename htmLawed.php (to kses.php, e.g.) and replace the Kses file (or just replace the code in the Kses file with the htmLawed code). If the kses() function in the Kses file had been renamed by the application developer (e.g., in WordPress, it is named wp\_kses()), then appropriately rename the kses() function in the htmLawed code. Then, add the following code (which was a part of htmLawed prior to version 1.2):

`// kses compatibility`

`function kses($t, $h, $p=array('http', 'https', 'ftp', 'news', 'nntp', 'telnet', 'gopher', 'mailto')){`

`foreach($h as $k=>$v){`

`$h[$k]['n']['*'] = 1;`

`}`

`$C['cdata'] = $C['comment'] = $C['make_tag_strict'] = $C['no_deprecated_attr'] = $C['unique_ids'] = 0;`

`$C['keep_bad'] = 1;`

`$C['elements'] = count($h) ? strtolower(implode(',', array_keys($h))) : '-*';`

`$C['hook'] = 'kses_hook';`

`$C['schemes'] = '*:'. implode(',', $p);`

`return htmLawed($t, $C, $h);`

`}`

`function kses_hook($t, &$C, &$S){`

`return $t;`

`}`

  If the Kses file used by the application has been significantly altered by the application developers, then one may need a different approach. E.g., with WordPress (as in the year 2012), it is best to copy the htmLawed code, along with the above-mentioned additions, to wp\_includes/kses.php, rename the newly added function kses() to wp\_kses(), and delete the code for the original wp\_kses() function.

  If the Kses code has a non-empty hook function (e.g., wp\_kses\_hook() in case of WordPress), then the code for htmLawed's kses\_hook() function should be appropriately edited. However, the requirement of the hook function should be re-evaluated considering that htmLawed has extra capabilities. With WordPress, the hook function is an essential one. The following code is suggested for the htmLawed kses\_hook() in case of WordPress:

`// kses compatibility`

`function kses_hook($string, &$cf, &$spec){`

`$allowed_html = $spec;`

`$allowed_protocols = array();`

`foreach($cf['schemes'] as $v){`

`foreach($v as $k2=>$v2){`

`if(!in_array($k2, $allowed_protocols)){`

`$allowed_protocols[] = $k2;`

`}`

`}`

`}`

`return wp_kses_hook($string, $allowed_html, $allowed_protocols);`

`}`

### 2.7  Tolerance for ill-written HTML

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed can work with ill-written HTML code in the input. However, HTML that is too ill-written may not be *read* as HTML, and may therefore get identified as mere plain text. Following statements indicate the degree of *looseness* that htmLawed can work with, and can be provided in instructions to writers:

  \*  Tags must be flanked by < and > with no > inside -- any needed > should be put in as &gt;. It is possible for tag content (element name and attributes) to be spread over many lines instead of being on one. A space may be present between the tag content and >, like <div > and <img / >, but not after the <.

  \*  Element and attribute names need not be lower-cased.

  \*  Attribute string of elements may be liberally spaced with tabs, line-breaks, etc.

  \*  Attribute values may be single- and not double-quoted.

  \*  Left-padding of numeric entities (like, &#0160;, &x07ff;) with 0 is okay as long as the number of characters between between the & and the ; does not exceed 8. All entities must end with ; though.

  \*  Named character entities must be properly cased. Thus, &Lt; or &TILDE; will not be recognized as entities and will be *neutralized*.

  \*  HTML comments should not be inside element tags (they can be between tags), and should begin with <!-- and end with -->. Characters like <, >, and & may be allowed inside depending on $config, but any --> inside should be put in as --&gt;. Any -- inside will be automatically converted to -, and a space will be added before the --> comment-closing marker  unless $config["comments"] is set to 4 ([section 3.3.1](#s3.3.1)).

  \*  CDATA sections should not be inside element tags, and can be in element content only if plain text is allowed for that element. They should begin with <[CDATA[ and end with ]]>. Characters like <, >, and & may be allowed inside depending on $config, but any ]]> inside should be put in as ]]&gt;.

  \*  For attribute values, character entities &lt;, &gt; and &amp; should be used instead of characters < and >, and & (when & is not part of a character entity). This applies even for Javascript code in values of attributes like onclick.

  \*  Characters <, >, & and " that are part of actual Javascript, etc., code in script elements should be used as such and not be put in as entities like &gt;. Otherwise, though the HTML will be valid, the code may fail to work. Further, if such characters have to be used, then they should be put inside CDATA sections.

  \*  Simple instructions like "an opening tag cannot be present between two closing tags" and "nested elements should be closed in the reverse order of how they were opened" can help authors write balanced HTML. If tags are imbalanced, htmLawed will try to balance them, but in the process, depending on $config["keep\_bad"], some code/text may be lost.

  \*  Input authors should be notified of admin-specified allowed elements, attributes, configuration values (like conversion of named entities to numeric ones), etc.

  \*  With $config["unique\_ids"] not 0 and the id attribute being permitted, writers should carefully avoid using duplicate or invalid id values as even though htmLawed will correct/remove the values, the final output may not be the one desired. E.g., when <a id="home"></a><input id="home" /><label for="home"></label> is processed into

<a id="home"></a><input id="prefix\_home" /><label for="home"></label>.

  \*  Even if intended HTML is lost from an ill-written input, the processed output will be more secure and standard-compliant.

  \*  For URLs, unless $config["scheme"] is appropriately set, writers should avoid using escape characters or entities in schemes. E.g., htt&#112; (which many browsers will read as the harmless http) may be considered bad by htmLawed.

  \*  htmLawed will attempt to put plain text present directly inside blockquote, form, map and noscript elements (illegal as per the specifications) inside auto-generated div elements during tag balancing ([section 3.3.3](#s3.3.3)).

### 2.8  Limitations & work-arounds

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed's main objective is to make the input text *more* standard-compliant, secure for readers, and free of HTML elements and attributes considered undesirable by the administrator. Some of its current limitations, regardless of this objective, are noted below along with possible work-arounds.

  It should be borne in mind that no browser application is 100% standard-compliant, standard specifications continue to evolve, and many browsers accept commonly used non-standard HTML. Regarding security, note that *unsafe* HTML code is not legally invalid per se.

  \*  htmLawed might not strictly adhere to *current* HTML standards as standard specification for HTML by [WHATWG](http://www.whatwg.org) is continuously evolving, and there is laxity among HTML interpreters (browsers) regarding standards. Admins can configure htmLawed to be more strict about standard compliance.

  \*  In general, htmLawed processes input to generate output that is most likely to be standard-compatible in most users' browsers. Thus, for example, it does not enforce the required value of 0 on border attribute of img (an HTML version 5 specification).

  \*  htmLawed is meant for input that goes into the body of HTML documents. HTML's head-level elements are not supported, nor are the frame-specific elements frameset, frame and noframes. However, content of the latter elements can be individually filtered through htmLawed.

  \*  It cannot handle input that has non-HTML code like SVG and MathML. One way around is to break the input into pieces and passing only those without non-HTML code to htmLawed. Another is described in [section 3.9](#s3.9). A third way may be to some how take advantage of the $config["and\_mark"] parameter (see [section 3.2](#s3.2)).

  \*  By default, htmLawed won't check many attribute values for standard compliance. E.g., width="20m" with the dimension in non-standard m is let through. Implementing universal and strict attribute value checks can make htmLawed slow and resource-intensive. Admins should look at the hook\_tag parameter ([section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)) or $spec to enforce finer checks on attribute values.

  \*  By default, htmLawed considers all ARIA, data-\*, event, and microdata attributes as global attributes and permits them in all elements. This is not strictly standard-compliant. E.g., the itemtype microdata attribute is permitted only in elements that also have the itemscope attribute. Admins can configure htmLawed to be more strict about this ([section 2.3](#s2.3)).

  \*  The attributes, whether deprecated (which can be transformed by htmLawed) or not, that it supports are largely those that are in the specifications. Only a few of the proprietary attributes are supported. However, $spec can be used to allow custom attributes ([section 2.3](#s2.3)).

  \*  Except for contained URLs and dynamic expressions (also optional), htmLawed does not check CSS style property values. Admins should look at using the hook\_tag parameter ([section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)) or $spec for finer checks. Perhaps the best option is to disallow style but allow class attributes with the right oneof or match values for class, and have the various class style properties in .css CSS stylesheet files.

  \*  htmLawed does not parse emoticons, decode *BBcode*, or *wikify*, auto-converting text to proper HTML. Similarly, it won't convert line-breaks to br elements. Such functions are beyond its purview. Admins should use other code to pre- or post-process the input for such purposes.

  \*  htmLawed cannot be used to have links force-opened in new windows (by auto-adding appropriate target and onclick attributes to a). Admins should look at Javascript-based DOM-modifying solutions for this. Admins may also be able to use a custom hook function to enforce such checks (hook\_tag parameter; see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  \*  Nesting-based checks are not possible. E.g., one cannot disallow p elements specifically inside td while permitting it elsewhere. Admins may be able to use a custom hook function to enforce such checks (hook\_tag parameter; see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  \*  Except for optionally converting absolute or relative URLs to the other type, htmLawed will not alter URLs (e.g., to change the value of query strings or to convert http to https. Having absolute URLs may be a standard-requirement, e.g., when HTML is embedded in email messages, whereas altering URLs for other purposes is beyond htmLawed's goals. Admins may be able to use a custom hook function to enforce such checks (hook\_tag parameter; see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  \*  Pairs of opening and closing tags that do not enclose any content (like <em></em>) are not removed. This may be against the standard specification for certain elements (e.g., table). However, presence of such standard-incompliant code will not break the display or layout of content. Admins can also use simple regex-based code to filter out such code.

  \*  htmLawed does not check for certain element orderings described in the standard specifications (e.g., in a table, tbody is allowed before tfoot). Admins may be able to use a custom hook function to enforce such checks (hook\_tag parameter; see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  \*  htmLawed does not check the number of nested elements. E.g., it will allow two caption elements in a table element, illegal as per standard specifications. Admins may be able to use a custom hook function to enforce such checks (hook\_tag parameter; see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  \*  There are multiple ways to interpret ill-written HTML. E.g., in <small><small>text</small>, is it that the second closing tag for small is missing or is it that the second opening tag for small was put in by mistake? htmLawed corrects the HTML in the string assuming the former, while the user may have intended the string for the latter. This is an issue that is impossible to address perfectly.

  \*  htmLawed might convert certain entities to actual characters and remove backslashes and CSS comment-markers (/\*) in style attribute values in order to detect malicious HTML like crafted, Internet Explorer browser-specific dynamic expressions like &#101;xpression.... If this is too harsh, admins can allow CSS expressions through htmLawed core but then use a custom function through the hook\_tag parameter ([section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)) to more specifically identify CSS expressions in the style attribute values. Also, using $config["style\_pass"], it is possible to have htmLawed pass style attribute values without even looking at them ([section 3.4.8](#s3.4.8)).

  \*  htmLawed does not correct certain possible attribute-based security vulnerabilities (e.g., <a href="http://x%22+style=%22background-image:xss">x</a>). These arise when browsers mis-identify markup in *escaped* text, defeating the very purpose of escaping text (a bad browser will read the given example as <a href="http://x" style="background-image:xss">x</a>).

  \*  Because of inadequate Unicode support in PHP, htmLawed does not remove the *high value* HTML-invalid characters with multi-byte code-points. Such characters however are extremely unlikely to be in the input. (see [section 3.1](#s3.1)).

  \*  htmLawed does not check or correct the character encoding of the input it receives. In conjunction with permitting circumstances such as when the character encoding is left undefined through HTTP headers or HTML meta tags, this can permit an exploit (like Google's *UTF-7/XSS* vulnerability of the past). Also, htmLawed can mangle input text if it is not well-formed in terms of character encoding. Administrators can consider using code available elsewhere to check well-formedness of input text characters to correct any defect.

  \*  htmLawed is expected to work with input texts in ASCII standard-compatible single-byte encodings such as national variants of ASCII (like ISO-646-DE/German of the ISO 646 standard), extended ASCII variants (like ISO 8859-10/Turkish of the ISO 8859/ISO Latin standard), ISO 8859-based Windows variants (like Windows 1252), EBCDIC, Shift JIS (Japanese), GB-Roman (Chinese), and KS-Roman (Korean). It should also properly handle texts with variable-byte encodings like UTF-7 (Unicode) and UTF-8 (Unicode). However, htmLawed may mangle input texts with double-byte encodings like UTF-16 (Unicode), JIS X 0208:1997 (Japanese) and K SX 1001:1992 (Korean), or the UTF-32 (Unicode) quadruple-byte encoding. If an input text has such an encoding, administrators can use PHP's [iconv](http://php.net/manual/en/book.iconv.php) functions, or some other mean, to convert text to UTF-8 before passing it to htmLawed.

  \*  Like any script using PHP's PCRE regex functions, PHP setup-specific low PCRE limit values can cause htmLawed to at least partially fail with very long input texts.

### 2.9  Examples of usage

[(to top)](#peak)

  Safest, allowing only *safe* HTML markup --

`$config = array('safe'=>1);`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config);`

  Simplest, allowing all valid HTML markup including Javascript --

`$out = htmLawed($in);`

  Allowing all valid HTML markup but restricting URL schemes in src attribute values to http and https --

`$config = array('schemes'=>'*:*; src:http, https');`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config);`

  Allowing only safe HTML and the elements a, em, and strong --

`$config = array('safe'=>1, 'elements'=>'a, em, strong');`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config);`

  Not allowing elements script and object --

`$config = array('elements'=>'* -script -object');`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config);`

  Not allowing attributes id and style --

`$config = array('deny_attribute'=>'id, style');`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config);`

  Permitting only attributes title and href --

`$config = array('deny_attribute'=>'* -title -href');`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config);`

  Remove bad/disallowed tags altogether instead of converting them to entities --

`$config = array('keep_bad'=>0);`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config);`

  Allowing attribute title only in a and not allowing attributes id, style, or scriptable *on\** attributes like onclick --

`$config = array('deny_attribute'=>'title, id, style, on*');`

`$spec = 'a=title';`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config, $spec);`

  Allowing a custom attribute, vFlag, in img and permitting custom use of the standard attribute, rel, in input --

`$spec = 'img=vFlag; input=rel';`

`$out = htmLawed($in, $config, $spec);`

  Some case-studies are presented below.

  **1.** A blog administrator wants to allow only a, em, strike, strong and u in comments, but needs strike and u transformed to span for better XHTML 1-strict compliance, and, he wants the a links to point only to http or https resources:

`$processed = htmLawed($in, array('elements'=>'a, em, strike, strong, u', 'make_tag_strict'=>1, 'safe'=>1, 'schemes'=>'*:http, https'), 'a=href');`

  **2.** An author uses a custom-made web application to load content on his website. He is the only one using that application and the content he generates has all types of HTML, including scripts. The web application uses htmLawed primarily as a tool to correct errors that creep in while writing HTML and to take care of the occasional *bad* characters in copy-paste text introduced by Microsoft Office. The web application provides a preview before submitted input is added to the content. For the previewing process, htmLawed is set up as follows:

`$processed = htmLawed($in, array('css_expression'=>1, 'keep_bad'=>1, 'make_tag_strict'=>1, 'schemes'=>'*:*', 'valid_xhtml'=>1));`

  For the final submission process, keep\_bad is set to 6. A value of 1 for the preview process allows the author to note and correct any HTML mistake without losing any of the typed text.

  **3.** A data-miner is scraping information in a specific table of similar web-pages and is collating the data rows, and uses htmLawed to reduce unnecessary markup and white-spaces:

`$processed = htmLawed($in, array('elements'=>'tr, td', 'tidy'=>-1), 'tr, td =');`

## 3  Details

[(to top)](#peak)

### 3.1  Invalid/dangerous characters

[(to top)](#peak)

  Valid characters (more correctly, their code-points) in HTML or XML are, hexadecimally, 9, a, d, 20 to d7ff, and e000 to 10ffff, except fffe and ffff (decimally, 9, 10, 13, 32 to 55295, and 57344 to 1114111, except 65534 and 65535). htmLawed removes the invalid characters 0 to 8, b, c, and e to 1f.

  Because of PHP's poor native support for multi-byte characters, htmLawed cannot check for the remaining invalid code-points. However, for various reasons, it is very unlikely for any of those characters to be in the input.

  Characters that are discouraged (see [section 5.1](#s5.1)) but not invalid are not removed by htmLawed.

  It (function hl\_tag()) also replaces the potentially dangerous (in some Mozilla [Firefox] and Opera browsers) soft-hyphen character (code-point, hexadecimally, ad, or decimally, 173) in attribute values with spaces. Where required, the characters <, >, &, and " are converted to entities.

  With $config["clean\_ms\_char"] set as 1 or 2, many of the discouraged characters (decimal code-points 127 to 159 except 133) that many Microsoft applications incorrectly use (as per the Windows 1252 [Cp-1252] or a similar encoding system), and the character for decimal code-point 133, are converted to appropriate decimal numerical entities (or removed for a few cases)-- see appendix in [section 5.4](#s5.4). This can help avoid some display issues arising from copying-pasting of content.

  With $config["clean\_ms\_char"] set as 2, characters for the hexadecimal code-points 82, 91, and 92 (for special single-quotes), and 84, 93, and 94 (for special double-quotes) are converted to ordinary single and double quotes respectively and not to entities.

  The character values are replaced with entities/characters and not character values referred to by the entities/characters to keep this task independent of the character-encoding of input text.

  The $config["clean\_ms\_char"] parameter should not be used if authors do not copy-paste Microsoft-created text, or if the input text is not believed to use the Windows 1252 (Cp-1252) or a similar encoding like Cp-1251 (otherwise, for example when UTF-8 encoding is in use, Japanese or Korean characters can get mangled). Further, the input form and the web-pages displaying it or its content should have the character encoding appropriately marked-up.

### 3.2  Character references/entities

[(to top)](#peak)

  Valid character entities take the form &\*; where \* is #x followed by a hexadecimal number (hexadecimal numeric entity; like &#xA0; for non-breaking space), or alphanumeric like gt (external or named entity; like &nbsp; for non-breaking space), or # followed by a number (decimal numeric entity; like &#160; for non-breaking space). Character entities referring to the soft-hyphen character (the &shy; or \xad character; hexadecimal code-point ad [decimal 173]) in URL-accepting attribute values are always replaced with spaces; soft-hyphens in attribute values introduce vulnerabilities in some older versions of the Opera and Mozilla [Firefox] browsers.

  htmLawed (function hl\_entity()):

  \*  Neutralizes entities with multiple leading zeroes or missing semi-colons (potentially dangerous)

  \*  Lowercases the X (for XML-compliance) and A-F of hexadecimal numeric entities

  \*  Neutralizes entities referring to characters that are HTML-invalid (see [section 3.1](#s3.1))

  \*  Neutralizes entities referring to characters that are HTML-discouraged (code-points, hexadecimally, 7f to 84, 86 to 9f, and fdd0 to fddf, or decimally, 127 to 132, 134 to 159, and 64991 to 64976). Entities referring to the remaining discouraged characters (see [section 5.1](#s5.1) for a full list) are let through.

  \*  Neutralizes named entities that are not in the HTML5 specification

  \*  Optionally converts valid HTML-specific named entities except &gt;, &lt;, &quot;, and &amp; to decimal numeric ones (hexadecimal if $config["hexdec\_entity"] is 2) for generic XML-compliance. For this, $config["named\_entity"] should be 1.

  \*  Optionally converts hexadecimal numeric entities to the more widely supported decimal ones. For this, $config["hexdec\_entity"] should be 0.

  \*  Optionally converts decimal numeric entities to the hexadecimal ones. For this, $config["hexdec\_entity"] should be 2.

  *Neutralization* refers to the *entitification* of & to &amp;.

  **Note**: htmLawed does not convert entities to the actual characters represented by them; one can pass the htmLawed output through PHP's html\_entity\_decode [function](http://www.php.net/html_entity_decode) for that.

  **Note**: If $config["and\_mark"] is set, and set to a value other than 0, then the & characters in the original input are replaced with the control character for the hexadecimal code-point 6 (\x06; & characters introduced by htmLawed, e.g., after converting < to &lt;, are not affected). This allows one to distinguish, say, an &gt; introduced by htmLawed and an &gt; put in by the input writer, and can be helpful in further processing of the htmLawed-processed text (e.g., to identify the character sequence o(><)o to generate an emoticon image). When this feature is active, admins should ensure that the htmLawed output is not directly used in web pages or XML documents as the presence of the \x06 can break documents. Before use in such documents, and preferably before any storage, any remaining \x06 should be changed back to &, e.g., with:

`$final = str_replace("\x06", '&', $prelim);`

  Also, see [section 3.9](#s3.9).

### 3.3  HTML elements

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed can be configured to allow only certain HTML elements (tags) in the input. Disallowed elements (just tag-content, and not element-content), based on $config["keep\_bad"], are either *neutralized* (converted to plain text by entitification of < and >) or removed.

  E.g., with only em permitted:

  Input:

`<em>My</em> website is <a href="http://a.com>a.com</a>.`

  Output, with $config["keep\_bad"] = 0:

`<em>My</em> website is a.com.`

  Output, with $config["keep\_bad"] not 0:

`<em>My</em> website is &lt;a href=""&gt;a.com&lt;/a&gt;.`

  See [section 3.3.3](#s3.3.3) for differences between the various non-zero $config["keep\_bad"] values.

  htmLawed by default permits these 122 HTML elements:

`a, abbr, acronym, address, applet, area, article, aside, audio, b, bdi, bdo, big, blockquote, br, button, canvas, caption, center, cite, code, col, colgroup, command, data, datalist, dd, del, details, dfn, dialog, dir, div, dl, dt, em, embed, fieldset, figcaption, figure, font, footer, form, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, header, hgroup, hr, i, iframe, img, input, ins, isindex, kbd, keygen, label, legend, li, link, main, map, mark, menu, meta, meter, nav, noscript, object, ol, optgroup, option, output, p, param, picture, pre, progress, q, rb, rbc, rp, rt, rtc, ruby, s, samp, script, section, select, slot, small, source, span, strike, strong, style, sub, summary, sup, table, tbody, td, template, textarea, tfoot, th, thead, time, tr, track, tt, u, ul, var, video, wbr`

  htmLawed also supports use of custom HTML elements, but this support can be turned off when $config is appropriately set (i.e., in default configuration, such elements are permitted); see [section 3.3.6](#s3.3.6).

  Elements math and svg are not supported. They and their content will get *filtered* unless a strategy like in [section 3.9](#s3.9) is used.

  Elements like acronym, applet, basefont, bgsound, big, blink, center, command, dir, font, hgroup, image, keygen, marquee, menuitem, nobr, noembed, rb, rtc, shadow, spacer, strike, tt, and xmp are currently obsolete/deprecated. Some of them, like acronym and keygen, are supported in htmLawed (see above list). *Tag transformation* is possible for improving compliance with HTML standards -- most, but not all, of the obsolete/deprecated elements are converted to valid  ones; see [section 3.3.2](#s3.3.2).

  These 16 htmLawed-supported elements are *empty* elements that have an opening tag with possible content but no element content (thus, no closing tag): area, br, col, command, embed, hr, img, input, isindex, keygen, link, meta, param, source, track, and wbr.

  As per standards, closing tags are optional for these elements under certain conditions: caption, colgroup, dd, dt, li, optgroup, option, p, rp, rt, tbody, td, tfoot, th, thead, and tr. By default, htmLawed will add a missing closing tag for such elements, unless balancing ([section 3.3.3](#s3.3.3)) is turned off.

  With $config["safe"] = 1, the default set of htmLawed-supported elements will exclude applet, audio, canvas, dialog, embed, iframe, object, script and video; see [section 3.6](#s3.6).

  When $config["elements"], which specifies allowed elements, is *properly* defined, and neither empty nor set to 0 or \*, the default set is not used. To have elements added to or removed from the default set, a +/- notation is used. E.g., \*-script-object implies that only script and object are disallowed, whereas \*+noembed means that noembed is also allowed. For an element with a hyphen in name, use round brackets around the name; e.g., (my-custom-element). Elements can also be specified as comma separated names. E.g., a, b, i means only a, b and i are permitted. In this notation, \*, + and - have no significance and can actually cause a mis-reading.

  Some more examples of $config["elements"] values indicating permitted elements (note that empty spaces are liberally allowed for clarity):

  \*  a, blockquote, code, em, strong -- only a, blockquote, code, em, and strong

  \*  \*-script -- all excluding script

  \*  \* -acronym -big -center -dir -font -isindex -s -strike -tt -- only non-obsolete/deprecated elements of HTML5

  \*  \*+noembed-script -- all including noembed excluding script

  \*  \*+noembed+(my-custom-element) -- all including noembed and my-custom-element

  Some mis-usages (and the resulting permitted elements) that can be avoided:

  \*  -\* -- none; instead of htmLawed, one might just use, e.g., the htmlspecialchars() PHP function

  \*  \*, -script -- all except script; admin probably meant \*-script

  \*  -\*, a, em, strong -- all; admin probably meant a, em, strong

  \*  \* -- all; admin need not have set elements

  \*  \*-form+form -- all; a + will always over-ride any -

  \*  \*, noembed -- only noembed; admin probably meant \*+noembed

  \*  a, +b, i -- only a and i; admin probably meant a, b, i

  Basically, when using the +/- notation, commas (,) should not be used, and vice versa, and \* should be used with the former but not the latter.

  **Note**: Even if an element that is not in the default set is allowed through $config["elements"], like noembed in the last example, it will eventually be removed during tag balancing unless such balancing is turned off ($config["balance"] set to 0). Currently, the only way around this, which actually is simple, is to edit htmLawed's PHP code which define various arrays in the function hl\_balance() to accommodate the element and its nesting properties.

  A possible second way to specify allowed elements is to set $config["parent"] to an element name that supposedly will hold the input, and to set $config["balance"] to 1. During tag balancing (see [section 3.3.3](#s3.3.3)), all elements that cannot legally nest inside the parent element will be removed. The parent element is auto-reset to div if $config["parent"] is empty, body, or an element not in htmLawed's default set of 122 elements.

#### 3.3.1  Handling of comments & CDATA sections

[(to top)](#peak)

  CDATA sections have the format <![CDATA[...anything but not "]]>"...]]>, and HTML comments, <!--...anything but not "-->"... -->. Neither HTML comments nor CDATA sections can reside inside tags. HTML comments can exist anywhere else, but CDATA sections can exist only where plain text is allowed (e.g., immediately inside td element content but not immediately inside tr element content).

  htmLawed (function hl\_commentCdata()) handles HTML comments or CDATA sections depending on the values of $config["comment"] or $config["cdata"]. If 0, such markup is not looked for and the text is processed like plain text. If 1, it is removed completely. If 2, it is preserved but any <, > and & inside are changed to entities. If 3 for $config["cdata"], or 3 or 4 for $config["comment"], they are left as such. When $config["comment"] is set to 4, htmLawed will not force a space character before the --> comment-closing marker. While such a space is required for standard-compliance, it can corrupt marker code put in HTML by some software (such as Microsoft Outlook).

  Note that for the last two cases, HTML comments and CDATA sections will always be removed from tag content (function hl\_tag()).

  Examples:

  Input:

`<!-- home link--><a href="home.htm"><![CDATA[x=&y]]>Home</a>`

  Output ($config["comment"] = 0, $config["cdata"] = 2):

`&lt;-- home link--&gt;<a href="home.htm"><![CDATA[x=&amp;y]]>Home</a>`

  Output ($config["comment"] = 1, $config["cdata"] = 2):

`<a href="home.htm"><![CDATA[x=&amp;y]]>Home</a>`

  Output ($config["comment"] = 2, $config["cdata"] = 2):

`<!-- home link --><a href="home.htm"><![CDATA[x=&amp;y]]>Home</a>`

  Output ($config["comment"] = 2, $config["cdata"] = 1):

`<!-- home link --><a href="home.htm">Home</a>`

  Output ($config["comment"] = 3, $config["cdata"] = 3):

`<!-- home link --><a href="home.htm"><![CDATA[x=&y]]>Home</a>`

  Output ($config["comment"] = 4, $config["cdata"] = 3):

`<!-- home link--><a href="home.htm"><![CDATA[x=&y]]>Home</a>`

  For standard-compliance, comments are given the form <!--comment -->, and any -- in the content is made -. When $config["comment"] is set to 4, htmLawed will not force a space character before the --> comment-closing marker.

  When $config["safe"] = 1, CDATA sections and comments are considered plain text unless $config["comment"] or $config["cdata"] is explicitly specified; see [section 3.6](#s3.6).

#### 3.3.2  Tag-transformation for better compliance with standards

[(to top)](#peak)

  If $config["make\_tag\_strict"] is set and not 0, following deprecated elements (and attributes), even if admin-permitted, are mutated as indicated (element content remains intact; function hl\_deprecatedElement()):

  \*  acronym - abbr

  \*  applet - based on $config["make\_tag\_strict"], unchanged (1) or removed (2)

  \*  big - span style="font-size: larger;"

  \*  center - div style="text-align: center;"

  \*  dir - ul

  \*  font (face, size, color) - span style="font-family: ; font-size: ; color: ;" (size transformation [reference](http://web.archive.org/web/20180201141931/http%3A//style.cleverchimp.com/font_size_intervals/altintervals.html))

  \*  isindex - based on $config["make\_tag\_strict"], unchanged (1) or removed (2)

  \*  s - span style="text-decoration: line-through;"

  \*  strike - span style="text-decoration: line-through;"

  \*  tt - code

  For an element with a pre-existing style attribute value, the extra style properties are appended.

  Example input:

`<center>`

`The PHP <s>software</s> script used for this <strike>web-page</strike> web-page is <font style="font-weight: bold " face=arial size='+3' color   =  "red  ">htmLawedTest.php</font>, from <u style= 'color:green'>PHP Labware</u>.`

`</center>`

  The output:

`<div style="text-align: center;">`

`The PHP <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">software</span> script used for this <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">web-page</span> web-page is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%; color: red; font-family: arial;">htmLawedTest.php</span>, from <u style="color:green">PHP Labware</u>.`

`</div>`

#### 3.3.3  Tag balancing & proper nesting

[(to top)](#peak)

  If $config["balance"] is set to 1, htmLawed (function hl\_balance()) checks and corrects the input to have properly balanced tags and legal element content (i.e., any element nesting should be valid, and plain text may be present only in the content of elements that allow them).

  Depending on the value of $config["keep\_bad"] (see [section 2.2](#s2.2) and [section 3.3](#s3.3)), illegal content may be removed or neutralized to plain text by converting < and > to entities:

  0 - remove; this option is available only to maintain Kses-compatibility and should not be used otherwise (see [section 2.6](#s2.6))

  1 - neutralize tags and keep element content

  2 - remove tags but keep element content

  3 and 4 - like 1 and 2, but keep element content only if text (pcdata) is valid in parent element as per specs

  5 and 6 -  like 3 and 4, but line-breaks, tabs and spaces are left

  Example input (disallowing the p element):

`<*> Pseudo-tags <*>`

`<xml>Non-HTML tag xml</xml>`

`<p>`

`Disallowed tag p`

`</p>`

`<ul>Bad<li>OK</li></ul>`

  The output with $config["keep\_bad"] = 1:

`&lt;*&gt; Pseudo-tags &lt;*&gt;`

`&lt;xml&gt;Non-HTML tag xml&lt;/xml&gt;`

`&lt;p&gt;`

`Disallowed tag p`

`&lt;/p&gt;`

`<ul>Bad<li>OK</li></ul>`

  The output with $config["keep\_bad"] = 3:

`&lt;*&gt; Pseudo-tags &lt;*&gt;`

`&lt;xml&gt;Non-HTML tag xml&lt;/xml&gt;`

`&lt;p&gt;`

`Disallowed tag p`

`&lt;/p&gt;`

`<ul><li>OK</li></ul>`

  The output with $config["keep\_bad"] = 6:

`&lt;*&gt; Pseudo-tags &lt;*&gt;`

`Non-HTML tag xml`

`Disallowed tag p`

`<ul><li>OK</li></ul>`

  An option like 1 is useful, e.g., when a writer previews his submission, whereas one like 3 is useful before content is finalized and made available to all.

  **Note:** In the example above, unlike <\*>, <xml> gets considered as a tag (even though there is no HTML element named xml). Thus, the keep\_bad parameter's value affects <xml> but not <\*>. In general, text matching the regular expression pattern <(/?)([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z1-6]\*)([^>]\*?)\s?> is considered a tag (phrase enclosed by the angled brackets < and >, and starting [with an optional slash preceding] with an alphanumeric word that starts with an alphabet...), and is subjected to the keep\_bad value.

  Nesting/content rules for each of the 122 standard elements in htmLawed's default set (see [section 3.3](#s3.3)) are defined in function hl\_balance(). Any custom element ([section 3.3.6](#s3.3.6)) is permitted to be within and to contain any other element.

  Plain text and/or certain elements nested inside blockquote, form, map and noscript need to be in block-level elements. This point is often missed during manual writing of HTML code. htmLawed attempts to address this during balancing. E.g., if the parent container is set as form, the input B:<input type="text" value="b" />C:<input type="text" value="c" /> is converted to <div>B:<input type="text" value="b" />C:<input type="text" value="c" /></div>.

#### 3.3.4  Elements requiring child elements

[(to top)](#peak)

  As per HTML specifications, elements such as those below require legal child elements nested inside them:

`blockquote, dir, dl, form, map, menu, noscript, ol, optgroup, rbc, rtc, ruby, select, table, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, ul`

  In some cases, the specifications stipulate the number and/or the ordering of the child elements. A table can have 0 or 1 caption, tbody, tfoot, and thead, but they must be in this order: caption, thead, tfoot, tbody.

  htmLawed currently does not check for conformance to these rules. Note that any non-compliance in this regard will not introduce security vulnerabilities, crash browser applications, or affect the rendering of web-pages.

  With $config["direct\_list\_nest"] set to 1, htmLawed will allow direct nesting of ol, ul, or menu list within another ol, ul, or menu without requiring the child list to be within an li of the parent list. While this may not be standard-compliant, directly nested lists are rendered properly by almost all browsers. The parameter $config["direct\_list\_nest"] has no effect if tag balancing ([section 3.3.3](#s3.3.3)) is turned off.

#### 3.3.5  Beautify or compact HTML

[(to top)](#peak)

  By default, htmLawed will neither *beautify* HTML code by formatting it with indentations, etc., nor will it make it compact by removing un-needed white-space.(It does always properly white-space tag content.)

  As per the HTML standards, spaces, tabs and line-breaks in web-pages (except those inside pre elements) are all considered equivalent, and referred to as *white-spaces*. Browser applications are supposed to consider contiguous white-spaces as just a single space, and to disregard white-spaces trailing opening tags or preceding closing tags. This white-space *normalization* allows the use of text/code beautifully formatted with indentations and line-spacings for readability. Such *pretty* HTML can, however, increase the size of web-pages, or make the extraction or scraping of plain text cumbersome.

  With the $config parameter tidy, htmLawed can be used to beautify or compact the input text. Input with just plain text and no HTML markup is also subject to this. Besides pre, the script, and textarea elements, CDATA sections, and HTML comments are not subjected to the tidying process.

  Any custom HTML element ([section 3.3.6](#s3.3.6)) is treated like an inline element, like strong, during tidying.

  To *compact*, use $config["tidy"] = -1; single instances or runs of white-spaces are replaced with a single space, and white-spaces trailing and leading open and closing tags, respectively, are removed.

  To *beautify*, $config["tidy"] is set as 1, or for customized tidying, as a string like 2s2n. The s or t character specifies the use of spaces or tabs for indentation. The first and third characters, any of the digits 0-9, specify the number of spaces or tabs per indentation, and any parental lead spacing (extra indenting of the whole block of input text). The r and n characters are used to specify line-break characters: n for \n (Unix/Mac OS X line-breaks), rn or nr for \r\n (Windows/DOS line-breaks), or r for \r.

  For instance, with $config["tidy"] set as 3s2n, 3 space characters are used per indentation level, the entire block of text (HTML code) gets a lead (left spacing) of 2 space characters, and line-breaks are with \n character.

  The $config["tidy"] value of 1 is equivalent to 2s0n. Other $config["tidy"] values are read loosely: a value of 4 is equivalent to 4s0n; t2, to 1t2n; s, to 2s0n; 2TR, to 2t0r; T1, to 1t1n; nr3, to 3s0nr, and so on. Except in the indentations and line-spacings, runs of white-spaces are replaced with a single space during beautification.

  Input formatting using $config["tidy"] is not recommended when input text has mixed markup (like HTML + PHP).

#### 3.3.6  Custom HTML elements

[(to top)](#peak)

  Custom elements are HTML elements whose properties/behaviors are defined by the *author*, instead of being *universal* (i.e., defined by the HTML interpreter like a browser). Their names must begin with a lowercased a-z character, contain at least one hyphen (-), and cannot be: *annotation-xml, color-profile, font-face, font-face-src, font-face-uri, font-face-format, font-face-name, missing-glyph*. A huge variety of characters is permitted in the name.

`0-9 | . | _ | #xB7 | #xC0-#xD6 | #xD8-#xF6 | #xF8-#x37D | #x37F-#x1FFF | #x200C-#x200D | #x203F-#x2040 | #x2070-#x218F | #x2C00-#x2FEF | #x3001-#xD7FF | #xF900-#xFDCF | #xFDF0-#xFFFD | [#x10000-#xEFFFF]`

  With $config["any\_custom\_element"] set to 0, no custom element is permitted, whereas with a value of 1 (default value), any such element is permitted. Regardless of the setting, specific custom elements can be denied or permitted through $config["elements"] (see [section 3.3.1](#s3.3.1)).

  Any custom HTML element is treated like an inline element, like strong, during tidying ([section 3.3.5](#s3.3.5)). During tag balancing ([section 3.3.3](#s3.3.3)), any custom element is permitted to be within and to contain any other element. These laxities are necessitated because, by definition, custom elements are parochial.

  Custom elements are permitted to have attributes of any name consisting of any character except a few such as equal, forward slash, and most control characters (unless denied through $spec) and satisfying any data attribute name requirement.

### 3.4  Attributes

[(to top)](#peak)

  In its default setting, htmLawed will only permit attributes described in the HTML specifications (including deprecated ones). A list of the attributes and the elements they are allowed in is in [section 5.2](#s5.2). Using the $spec argument, htmLawed can be forced to permit custom, non-standard attributes as well as custom rules for standard attributes ([section 2.3](#s2.3)).

  Custom *data-\** (*data-star*) attributes, where the first three characters of the value of *star* (\*) after lower-casing do not equal xml, and the value of *star* does not have a colon (:), equal-to (=), newline, solidus (/), space or tab character, or any upper-case A-Z character are allowed in all elements. ARIA, event and microdata attributes like aria-live, onclick and itemid are also considered global attributes ([section 5.2](#s5.2)).

  When $config["deny\_attribute"] is not set, or set to 0, or empty (""), all attributes are permitted as per standards. Otherwise, $config["deny\_attribute"] can be set in two different ways. One way is as a list of comma-separated names of the denied attributes. on\* can be used to refer to the group of potentially dangerous, script-accepting event attributes like onchange that have on at the beginning of their names. Similarly, aria\* and data\* can be used to respectively refer to the set of all ARIA and data-\* attributes. The second way to set $config["deny\_attribute"] permits the denying of all but a few attributes globally. The notation is \* -attribute1 -attribute2 .... Thus, a value of \* -title -href implies that except href and title (where allowed as per standards) all other attributes are to be removed. Terms aria\* data\*, and on\* can be used in this notation, and a whitespace character is necessary before the - character.

  With $config["safe"] = 1 ([section 3.6](#s3.6)), any on\* event attribute is disallowed even if $config["deny\_attribute"] is set otherwise (such as \* -style -on\*).

  The attribute restrictions specified with $config["deny\_attribute"] apply to all elements. To deny attributes for only specific elements, $spec (see [section 2.3](#s2.3)) can be used. $spec can also be used to element-specifically permit an attribute otherwise denied through $config["deny\_attribute"].

  Finer restrictions on attributes can also be put into effect through $config["hook\_tag"] ([section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  Custom elements are permitted to have attributes of any name consisting of any character except a few such as equal, forward slash, and most control characters (unless denied through $spec) and satisfying any data attribute name requirement.

  htmLawed (function hl\_tag()) also:

  \*  Lower-cases attribute names

  \*  Removes duplicate attributes (last one stays)

  \*  Gives attributes the form name="value" and single-spaces them, removing unnecessary white-spacing

  \*  Provides *required* attributes (see [section 3.4.1](#s3.4.1))

  \*  Optionally lowercases certain standard attribute values (see [section 3.4.5](#s3.4.5))

  \*  Double-quotes values and escapes any " inside them

  \*  Replaces the possibly dangerous soft-hyphen characters (hexadecimal code-point ad) in the values with spaces

  \*  Allows custom function to additionally filter/modify attribute values (see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9))

#### 3.4.1  Auto-addition of XHTML-required attributes

[(to top)](#peak)

  If indicated attributes for the following elements are found missing, htmLawed (function hl\_tag()) will add them (with values same as attribute names unless indicated otherwise below):

  \*  area - alt (area)

  \*  area, img - src, alt (image)

  \*  bdo - dir (ltr)

  \*  form - action

  \*  label - command

  \*  map - name

  \*  optgroup - label

  \*  param - name

  \*  style - scoped

  \*  textarea - rows (10), cols (50)

  Additionally, with $config["xml:lang"] set to 1 or 2, if the lang but not the xml:lang attribute is declared, then the latter is added too, with a value copied from that of lang. This is for better standard-compliance. With $config["xml:lang"] set to 2, the lang attribute is removed (XHTML specification).

  Note that the name attribute for map, invalid in XHTML, is also transformed if required -- see [section 3.4.6](#s3.4.6).

#### 3.4.2  Duplicate/invalid id values

[(to top)](#peak)

  If $config["unique\_ids"] is 1, htmLawed (function hl\_tag()) removes id attributes with values that are not standards-compliant (must not have a space character) or duplicate. If $config["unique\_ids"] is a word (without a non-word character like space), any duplicate but otherwise valid value will be appropriately prefixed with the word to ensure its uniqueness.

  Even if multiple inputs need to be filtered (through multiple calls to htmLawed), htmLawed ensures uniqueness of id values as it uses a global variable ($GLOBALS["hl\_Ids"] array). Further, an admin can restrict the use of certain id values by presetting this variable before htmLawed is called into use. E.g.:

`$GLOBALS['hl_Ids'] = array('top'=>1, 'bottom'=>1, 'myform'=>1); // id values not allowed in input`

`$processed = htmLawed($text); // filter input`

#### 3.4.3  URL schemes & scripts in attribute values

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed edits attributes that take URLs as values if they are found to contain un-permitted schemes. E.g., if the afp scheme is not permitted, then <a href="afp://domain.org"> becomes <a href="denied:afp://domain.org">, and if Javascript is not permitted <a onclick="javascript:xss();"> becomes <a onclick="denied:javascript:xss();">.

  By default htmLawed permits these schemes in URLs for the href attribute:

`aim, app, feed, file, ftp, gopher, http, https, javascript, irc, mailto, news, nntp, sftp, ssh, tel, telnet, ws, wss`

  Also, only data, file, http, https, javascript, ws and wss are permitted in these attributes that accept URLs:

`action, archive, cite, classid, codebase, data, formaction, itemtype, longdesc, model, pluginspage, pluginurl, poster, src, srcset, style, usemap, and event attributes like onclick`

  With $config["safe"] = 1 ([section 3.6](#s3.6)), the above is changed to disallow app, data and javascript.

  **Note**: URLs in *data-\** attribute values are not checked, but $spec ([section 2.3](#s2.3)) or $config["hook\_tag"] ([section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)) can be used for this purpose.

  These default sets are used when $config["schemes"] is not set (see [section 2.2](#s2.2)). To over-ride the defaults, $config["schemes"] is defined as a string of semi-colon-separated sub-strings of type attribute: comma-separated schemes. E.g., href: mailto, http, https; onclick: javascript; src: http, https. For unspecified attributes, data, file, http, https and javascript are permitted. This can be changed by passing schemes for \* in $config["schemes"]. E.g., href: mailto, http, https; \*: https, https.

  \* (asterisk) can be put in the list of schemes to permit all protocols. E.g., style: \*; img: http, https results in protocols not being checked in style attribute values. However, in such cases, any relative-to-absolute URL conversion, or vice versa, ([section 3.4.4](#s3.4.4)) is not done. When an attribute is explicitly listed in $config["schemes"], then filtering is dictated by the setting for the attribute, with no effect of the setting for asterisk. That is, the set of attributes that asterisk refers to no longer includes the listed attribute.

  Thus, *to allow the xmpp scheme*, one can set $config["schemes"] as href: mailto, http, https; \*: http, https, xmpp, or href: mailto, http, https, xmpp; \*: http, https, xmpp, or \*: \*, and so on. The consequence of each of these example values will be different (e.g., only the last two but not the first will allow xmpp in href)

  As a side-note, one may find style: \* useful as URLs in style attributes can be specified in a variety of ways, and the patterns that htmLawed uses to identify URLs may mistakenly identify non-URL text.

  ! can be put in the list of schemes to disallow all protocols as well as *local* URLs. Thus, with href: http, style: !, <a href="http://cnn.com" style="background-image: url(local.jpg);">CNN</a> will become <a href="http://cnn.com" style="background-image: url(denied:local.jpg);">CNN</a>

  With $config["safe"] = 1 ([section 3.6](#s3.6)), all URLs are disallowed in the style attribute values, unless a rule for style is explicitly specified in $config["schemes"] or $config["style\_pass"] ([section 3.4.8](#s3.4.8)) is set to 1.

#### 3.4.4  Absolute & relative URLs in attribute values

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed can make absolute URLs in attributes like href relative ($config["abs\_url"] is -1), and vice versa ($config["abs\_url"] is 1). URLs in scripts are not considered for this, and so are URLs like #section\_6 (fragment), ?name=Tim#show (starting with query string), and ;var=1?name=Tim#show (starting with parameters). Further, this requires that $config["base\_url"] be set properly, with the :// and a trailing slash (/), with no query string, etc. E.g., file:///D:/page/, https://abc.com/x/y/, or http://localhost/demo/ are okay, but file:///D:/page/?help=1, abc.com/x/y/ and http://localhost/demo/index.htm are not.

  For making absolute URLs relative, only those URLs that have the $config["base\_url"] string at the beginning are converted. E.g., with $config["base\_url"] = "https://abc.com/x/y/", https://abc.com/x/y/a.gif and https://abc.com/x/y/z/b.gif become a.gif and z/b.gif respectively, while https://abc.com/x/c.gif is not changed.

  When making relative URLs absolute, only values for scheme, network location (host-name) and path values in the base URL are inherited. See [section 5.5](#s5.5) for more about the URL specification as per RFC [1808](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1808.txt).

#### 3.4.5  Lower-cased, standard attribute values

[(to top)](#peak)

  Optionally, for standard-compliance, htmLawed (function hl\_tag()) lower-cases standard attribute values to give, e.g., input type="password" instead of input type="Password", if $config["lc\_std\_val"] is 1. Attribute values matching those listed below for any of the elements listed further below (plus those for the type attribute of button or input) are lower-cased:

`all, auto, baseline, bottom, button, captions, center, chapters, char, checkbox, circle, col, colgroup, color, cols, data, date, datetime, datetime-local, default, descriptions, email, file, get, groups, hidden, image, justify, left, ltr, metadata, middle, month, none, number, object, password, poly, post, preserve, radio, range, rect, ref, reset, right, row, rowgroup, rows, rtl, search, submit, subtitles, tel, text, time, top, url, week`

`a, area, bdo, button, col, fieldset, form, img, input, object, ol, optgroup, option, param, script, select, table, td, textarea, tfoot, th, thead, tr, track, xml:space`

  The following *empty* (*minimized*) attributes are always assigned lower-cased values (same as the attribute names):

`checkbox, checked, command, compact, declare, defer, default, disabled, hidden, inert, ismap, itemscope, multiple, nohref, noresize, noshade, nowrap, open, radio, readonly, required, reversed, selected`

#### 3.4.6  Transformation of deprecated attributes

[(to top)](#peak)

  If $config["no\_deprecated\_attr"] is 0, then deprecated attributes are removed and, in most cases, their values are transformed to CSS style properties and added to the style attributes (function hl\_tag()). Except for bordercolor for table, tr and td, the scores of proprietary attributes that were never part of any cross-browser standard are not supported in this functionality.

  \*  align in caption, div, h, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, hr, img, input, legend, object, p, table - for img with value of left or right, becomes, e.g., float: left; for div and table with value center, becomes margin: auto; all others become, e.g., text-align: right

  \*  bgcolor in table, tbody, td, tfoot, th, thead, tr - E.g., bgcolor="#ffffff" becomes background-color: #ffffff

  \*  border in object - E.g., height="10" becomes height: 10px

  \*  bordercolor in table, td and tr - E.g., bordercolor=#999999 becomes border-color: #999999;

  \*  compact in dl, ol and ul - font-size: 85%

  \*  cellspacing in table - cellspacing="10" becomes border-spacing: 10px

  \*  clear in br - E.g., 'clear="all" becomes clear: both

  \*  height in td and th - E.g., height= "10" becomes height: 10px and height="\*" becomes height: auto

  \*  hspace in img and object - E.g., hspace="10" becomes margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px

  \*  language in script - language="VBScript" becomes type="text/vbscript"

  \*  name in a, form, iframe, img and map - E.g., name="xx" becomes id="xx"

  \*  noshade in hr - border-style: none; border: 0; background-color: gray; color: gray

  \*  nowrap in td and th - white-space: nowrap

  \*  size in hr - E.g., size="10" becomes height: 10px

  \*  vspace in img and object - E.g., vspace="10" becomes margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px

  \*  width in hr, pre, table, td and th - like height

  Example input:

`<img src="j.gif" alt="image" name="dad's" /><img src="k.gif" alt="image" id="dad_off" name="dad" />`

`<br clear="left" />`

`<hr noshade size="1" />`

`<img name="img" src="i.gif" align="left" alt="image" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="10em" height="20" border="1" style="padding:5px;" />`

`<table width="50em" align="center" bgcolor="red">`

`<tr>`

`<td width="20%">`

`<div align="center">`

`<h3 align="right">Section</h3>`

`<p align="right">Para</p>`

`</div>`

`</td>`

`<td width="*">`

`</td>`

`</tr>`

`</table>`

`<br clear="all" />`

  And the output with $config["no\_deprecated\_attr"] = 1:

`<img src="j.gif" alt="image" id="dad's" /><img src="k.gif" alt="image" id="dad_off" />`

`<br style="clear: left;" />`

`<hr style="border-style: none; border: 0; background-color: gray; color: gray; size: 1px;" />`

`<img src="i.gif" alt="image" width="10em" height="20" style="padding:5px; float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px;" id="img" />`

`<table width="50em" style="margin: auto; background-color: red;">`

`<tr>`

`<td style="width: 20%;">`

`<div style="margin: auto;">`

`<h3 style="text-align: right;">Section</h3>`

`<p style="text-align: right;">Para</p>`

`</div>`

`</td>`

`<td style="width: auto;">`

`</td>`

`</tr>`

`</table>`

`<br style="clear: both;" />`

  For lang, deprecated in XHTML 1.1, transformation is taken care of through $config["xml:lang"]; see [section 3.4.1](#s3.4.1).

  The attribute name is deprecated in form, iframe, and img, and is replaced with id if an id attribute doesn't exist and if the name value is appropriate for id (i.e., doesn't have a non-word character like space). For such replacements for a and map, for which the name attribute is deprecated in XHTML 1.1, $config["no\_deprecated\_attr"] should be set to 2 (when set to 1, for these two elements, the name attribute is retained).

#### 3.4.7  Anti-spam & href

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed (function hl\_tag()) can check the href attribute values (link addresses) as an anti-spam (email or link spam) measure.

  If $config["anti\_mail\_spam"] is not 0, the @ of email addresses in href values like mailto:a@b.com is replaced with text specified by $config["anti\_mail\_spam"]. The text should be of a form that makes it clear to others that the address needs to be edited before a mail is sent; e.g., <remove\_this\_antispam>@ (makes the example address a<remove\_this\_antispam>@b.com).

  For regular links, one can choose to have a rel attribute with nofollow in its value (which tells some search engines to not follow a link). This can discourage link spammers. Additionally, or as an alternative, one can choose to empty the href value altogether (disable the link).

  For use of these options, $config["anti\_link\_spam"] should be set as an array with values regex1 and regex2, both or one of which can be empty (like array("", "regex2")) to indicate that that option is not to be used. Otherwise, regex1 or regex2 should be PHP- and PCRE-compatible regular expression patterns: href values will be matched against them and those matching the pattern will accordingly be treated.

  Note that the regular expressions should have *delimiters*, and be well-formed and preferably fast. Absolute efficiency/accuracy is often not needed.

  An example, to have a rel attribute with nofollow for all links, and to disable links that do not point to domains abc.com and xyz.org:

`$config["anti_link_spam"] = array('`.`', '`://\W*(?!(abc\.com|xyz\.org))`');`

#### 3.4.8  Inline style properties

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed can check URL schemes and dynamic expressions (to guard against Javascript, etc., script-based insecurities) in inline CSS style property values in the style attributes. (CSS properties like background-image that accept URLs in their values are noted in [section 5.3](#s5.3).) Dynamic CSS expressions that allow scripting in the IE browser, and can be a vulnerability, can be removed from property values by setting $config["css\_expression"] to 1 (default setting). Note that when $config["css\_expression"] is set to 1, htmLawed will remove /\* from the style values.

  **Note**: Because of the various ways of representing characters in attribute values (URL-escapement, entitification, etc.), htmLawed might alter the values of the style attribute values, and may even falsely identify dynamic CSS expressions and URL schemes in them. If this is an important issue, checking of URLs and dynamic expressions can be turned off ($config["schemes"] = "...style:\*...", see [section 3.4.3](#s3.4.3), and $config["css\_expression"] = 0). Alternately, admins can use their own custom function for finer handling of style values through the hook\_tag parameter (see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  It is also possible to have htmLawed let through any style value by setting $config["style\_pass"] to 1.

  As such, it is better to set up a CSS file with class declarations, disallow the style attribute, set a $spec rule (see [section 2.3](#s2.3)) for class for the oneof or match parameter, and ask writers to make use of the class attribute.

  With $config["safe"] = 1 ([section 3.6](#s3.6)) , all URLs are disallowed in the style attribute values, unless a rule for style is explicitly specified in $config["schemes"] ([section 3.4.3](#s3.4.3)) or $config["style\_pass"] is set to 1.

#### 3.4.9  Hook function for tag content

[(to top)](#peak)

  It is possible to utilize a custom hook function to alter the tag content htmLawed has finalized (i.e., after it has checked/corrected for required attributes, transformed attributes, lower-cased attribute names, etc.). The function should have two arguments, the first receiving an element name and the second receiving either 0 (in case of a closing tag) or an array of attribute name-value pairs (opening tag). It should return a string  with full HTM markup, either an opening or a closing tag with element name and any string of attributes.

  When $config parameter hook\_tag is set to the name of a function or class method, htmLawed (function hl\_tag()) will pass on the element name, and the *finalized* attribute name-value pairs as array elements to the function. The function, after completing a task such as filtering or tag transformation, will typically return an empty string, the full opening tag string like <element\_name attribute\_1\_name="attribute\_1\_value"...> (for empty elements like img and input, the element-closing slash / should also be included), etc.

  This is a **powerful functionality** that can be exploited for various objectives: consolidate-and-convert inline style attributes to class, convert embed elements to object, permit only one caption element in a table element, disallow embedding of certain types of media, **inject HTML**, use [CSSTidy](http://csstidy.sourceforge.net) to sanitize style attribute values, etc.

  As an example, the custom hook code below can be used to force a series of specifically ordered id attributes on all elements, and a specific param element inside all object elements:

`function my_tag_function($element, $attribute_array=0){`

`// If second argument is not received, it means a closing tag is being handled`

`if(is_numeric($attribute_array)){`

`return "</$element>";`

`}`

`static $id = 0;`

`// Remove any duplicate element`

`if($element == 'param' && isset($attribute_array['allowscriptaccess'])){`

`return '';`

`}`

`$new_element = '';`

`// Force a serialized ID number`

`$attribute_array['id'] = 'my_'. $id;`

`++$id;`

`// Inject param for allowscriptaccess`

`if($element == 'object'){`

`$new_element = '<param id="my_'. $id. '"; allowscriptaccess="never" />';`

`++$id;`

`}`

`$string = '';`

`foreach($attribute_array as $k=>$v){`

`$string .= " {$k}=\"{$v}\"";`

`}`

`static $empty_elements = array('area'=>1, 'br'=>1, 'col'=>1, 'command'=>1, 'embed'=>1, 'hr'=>1, 'img'=>1, 'input'=>1, 'isindex'=>1, 'keygen'=>1, 'link'=>1, 'meta'=>1, 'param'=>1, 'source'=>1, 'track'=>1, 'wbr'=>1);`

`return "<{$element}{$string}". (array_key_exists($element, $empty_elements) ? ' /' : ''). '>'. $new_element;`

`}`

  The hook\_tag parameter is different from the hook parameter ([section 3.7](#s3.7)).

### 3.5  Simple configuration directive for most valid XHTML

[(to top)](#peak)

  If $config["valid\_xhtml"] is set to 1, some relevant $config parameters (indicated by ~ in [section 2.2](#s2.2)) are auto-adjusted. This allows one to pass the $config argument with a simpler value. If a value for a parameter auto-set through valid\_xhtml is still manually provided, then that value will over-ride the auto-set value.

### 3.6  Simple configuration directive for most *safe* HTML

[(to top)](#peak)

  *Safe* HTML refers to HTML that is restricted to reduce the vulnerability for scripting attacks (such as XSS) based on HTML code which otherwise may still be legal and compliant with the HTML standard specifications. When elements such as script and object, and attributes such as onmouseover and style are allowed in the input text, an input writer can introduce malevolent HTML code. Note that what is considered safe depends on the nature of the web application and the trust-level accorded to its users.

  htmLawed allows an admin to use $config["safe"] to auto-adjust multiple $config parameters (such as elements which declares the allowed element-set), which otherwise would have to be manually set. The relevant parameters are indicated by " in [section 2.2](#s2.2)). Thus, one can pass the $config argument with a simpler value. Having the safe parameter set to 1 is equivalent to setting the following $config parameters to the noted values :

`cdata - 0`

`comment - 0`

`deny_attribute - on*`

`elements - * -applet -audio -canvas -dialog -embed -iframe -object -script -video`

`schemes - href: aim, feed, file, ftp, gopher, http, https, irc, mailto, news, nntp, sftp, ssh, tel, telnet, ws, wss; style: !; *:file, http, https, ws, wss`

  With safe set to 1, htmLawed considers CDATA sections and HTML comments as plain text, and prohibits the applet, audio, canvas, dialog, embed, iframe, object, script and video elements, and the on\* attributes like onclick. ( There are $config parameters like css\_expression that are not affected by the value set for safe but whose default values still contribute towards a more *safe* output.) Further, unless overridden by the value for parameter schemes (see [section 3.4.3](#s3.4.3)), the schemes app, data and javascript are not permitted, and URLs with schemes are neutralized so that, e.g., style="moz-binding:url(http://danger)" becomes style="moz-binding:url(denied:http://danger)".

  Admins, however, may still want to completely deny the style attribute, e.g., with code like

`$processed = htmLawed($text, array('safe'=>1, 'deny_attribute'=>'style'));`

  With $config["safe"] = 1, all URLs are disallowed in the style attribute values, unless a rule for style is explicitly specified in $config["schemes"] ([section 3.4.3](#s3.4.3)) or $config["style\_pass"] ([section 3.4.8](#s3.4.8)) is set to 1.

  Permitting the style attribute brings in risks of *click-jacking*, etc. CSS property values can render a page non-functional or be used to deface it. Except for URLs, dynamic expressions, and some other things, htmLawed does not completely check style values. It does provide ways for the code-developer implementing htmLawed to do such checks through the $spec argument, and through the hook\_tag parameter (see [section 3.4.8](#s3.4.8) for more). Disallowing style completely and relying on CSS classes and stylesheet files is recommended.

  If a value for a parameter auto-set through safe is still manually provided, then that value can over-ride the auto-set value. E.g., with $config["safe"] = 1 and $config["elements"] = "\* +script", script, but not applet, is allowed. Such over-ride does not occur for deny\_attribute (for legacy reason) when comma-separated attribute names are provided as the value for this parameter ([section 3.4](#s3.4)); instead htmLawed will add on\* to the value provided for deny\_attribute.

  A page illustrating the efficacy of htmLawed's anti-XSS abilities with safe set to 1 against XSS vectors listed by [RSnake](http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html) may be available [here](https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed/rsnake/RSnakeXSSTest.htm).

### 3.7  Using a hook function

[(to top)](#peak)

  If $config["hook"] is not set to 0, then htmLawed will allow preliminarily processed input to be altered by a function or class method named by $config["hook"] before starting the main work (but after handling of characters, entities, HTML comments and CDATA sections -- see code for function htmLawed()). The function should have three arguments â the processed input string, and the finalized $config and $spec arrays, in order â and it should return the string after any manipulation.

  The hook function also allows one to alter the *finalized* values of $config and $spec.

  Note that the hook parameter is different from the hook\_tag parameter ([section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  Snippets of hook function code developed by others may be available on the [htmLawed](https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed) website.

### 3.8  Obtaining *finalized* parameter values

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed can assign the *finalized* $config and $spec values to a variable named by $config["show\_setting"]. The variable, made global by htmLawed, is set as an array with four keys: config, with the $config value, spec, with the $spec value, time, with a value that is the Unix time (the output of PHP's microtime function) when htmLawed completed filtering, and version, with htmLawed version. Admins should use a PHP-compliant variable name (e.g., one that does not begin with a numerical digit) that does not conflict with variable names in their non-htmLawed code.

  The values, which are also post-hook function (if any), can be used to auto-generate information (on, e.g., the elements that are permitted) for input writers.

### 3.9  Retaining non-HTML tags in input with mixed markup

[(to top)](#peak)

  htmLawed does not remove certain characters that, though invalid, are nevertheless *discouraged* in HTML documents as per the specifications (see [section 5.1](#s5.1)). This can be utilized to deal with input that contains mixed markup. Input that may have HTML markup as well as some other markup that is based on the <, > and & characters is considered to have mixed markup. The non-HTML markup can be rather proprietary (like markup for emoticons/smileys), or standard (like MathML or SVG). Or it can be programming code meant for execution/evaluation (such as embedded PHP code).

  To deal with such mixed markup, the input text can be pre-processed to hide the non-HTML markup by specifically replacing the <, > and & characters with some of the HTML-discouraged characters (see [section 3.1.2](#s3.1.2)). Post-htmLawed processing, the replacements are reverted.

  An example (mixed HTML and PHP code in input text):

`$text = preg_replace('`<\?php(.+?)\?>`sm', "\x83?php\\1?\x84", $text);`

`$processed = htmLawed($text);`

`$processed = preg_replace('`\x83\?php(.+?)\?\x84`sm', '<?php$1?>', $processed);`

  This code will not work if $config["clean\_ms\_char"] is set to 1 ([section 3.1](#s3.1)), in which case one should instead deploy a hook function ([section 3.7](#s3.7)). (htmLawed internally uses certain control characters, code-points 1 to 7, and use of these characters as markers in the logic of hook functions may cause issues.)

  Admins may also be able to use $config["and\_mark"] to deal with such mixed markup; see [section 3.2](#s3.2).

### 4.4  Testing

[(to top)](#peak)

  To test htmLawed using a form interface, a [demo](htmLawedTest.php) web-page is provided with the htmLawed distribution (htmLawed.php and htmLawedTest.php should be in the same directory on the web-server). A file with [test-cases](htmLawed_TESTCASE.txt) is also provided.

### 4.5  Upgrade, & old versions

[(to top)](#peak)

  Upgrading is as simple as replacing the previous version of htmLawed.php, assuming the file was not modified for customized features. As htmLawed output is almost always used in static documents, upgrading should not affect old, finalized content.

  **Note:** The following upgrades may affect the functionality of a specific htmLawed installation:

  (1) From version 1.1-1.1.10 to 1.1.11 or later, if a hook\_tag function is in use: In version 1.1.11 and later, elements in closing tags (and not just the opening tags) are also passed to the function. There are no attribute names/values to pass, so a hook\_tag function receives only the element name. The hook\_tag function therefore may have to be edited. See [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9).

  (2) From version older than 1.2.beta to later, if htmLawed was used as Kses replacement with Kses code in use: In version 1.2.beta or later, htmLawed no longer provides direct support for code that uses Kses functions (see [section 2.6](#s2.6)).

  (3) From version older than 1.2 to later, if htmLawed is used without $config["safe"] set to 1: Unlike previous versions, htmLawed version 1.2 and later permit data and javascript URL schemes by default (see [section 3.4.3](#s3.4.3)).

  Old versions of htmLawed may be available online. E.g., for version 1.0, check <https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/downloads/htmLawed1.zip>; for 1.1.1, <https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/downloads/htmLawed111.zip>; and for 1.1.22, <https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/downloads/htmLawed1122.zip>.

### 4.6  Comparison with HTMLPurifier

[(to top)](#peak)

  The [HTMLPurifier](http://htmlpurifier.org) PHP library by Edward Yang is a good HTML filtering script that uses object-oriented PHP code. Compared to htmLawed, as of year 2015, HTMLPurifier:

  \*  does not support PHP versions older than 5.0 (HTMLPurifier dropped PHP 4 support after version 2)

  \*  is 15-20 times bigger (scores of files totalling more than 750 kb)

  \*  consumes 10-15 times more RAM memory (just including the HTMLPurifier files without calling the filter requires a few MBs of memory)

  \*  is expectedly considerably slower

  \*  lacks many of the extra features of htmLawed (like entity conversions and code compaction/beautification)

  \*  has poor documentation

  \*  may have finer checks for character encodings and attribute values

  \*  can log warnings and errors

### 4.7  Use through application plug-ins/modules

[(to top)](#peak)

  Plug-ins/modules to implement htmLawed in applications such as Drupal may have been developed. Check the application websites and the htmLawed [forum](https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed).

### 4.8  Use in non-PHP applications

[(to top)](#peak)

  Non-PHP applications written in Python, Ruby, etc., may be able to use htmLawed through system calls to the PHP engine. Such code may have been documented on the internet. Also check the forum on the htmLawed [site](https://bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed).

### 5.5  URL format

[(to top)](#peak)

  An *absolute* URL has a protocol or scheme, a network location or hostname, and, optional path, parameters, query and fragment segments. Thus, an absolute URL has this generic structure:

`(scheme) : (//network location) /(path) ;(parameters) ?(query) #(fragment)`

  The schemes can only contain letters, digits, +, . and -. Hostname is the portion after the // and up to the first / (if any; else, up to the end) when : is followed by a // (e.g., abc.com in ftp://abc.com/def); otherwise, it consists of everything after the : (e.g., def@abc.com in mailto:def@abc.com').

  *Relative* URLs do not have explicit schemes and network locations; such values are inherited from a *base* URL.

### 5.6  Brief on htmLawed code

[(to top)](#peak)

  Much of the code's logic and reasoning can be understood from the documentation above.

  The **output** of htmLawed is a text string containing the processed input. There is no custom error tracking.

  **Function arguments** for htmLawed are:

  \*  $in - first argument; a text string; the **input text** to be processed. Any extraneous slashes added by PHP when *magic quotes* are enabled should be removed beforehand using PHP's stripslashes() function.

  \*  $config - second argument; an associative array; optional; named $C within htmLawed code. The array has keys with names like balance and keep\_bad, and the values, which can be boolean, string, or array, depending on the key, are read to accordingly set the **configurable parameters** (indicated by the keys). All configurable parameters receive some default value if the value to be used is not specified by the user through $config. *Finalized* $config is thus a filtered and possibly larger array.

  \*  $spec - third argument; a text string; optional. The string has rules, written in an htmLawed-designated format, **specifying** element-specific attribute and attribute value restrictions. Function hl\_spec() is used to convert the string to an associative-array, named $S within htmLawed code, for internal use. *Finalized* $spec is thus an array.

  *Finalized* $config and $spec are made **global variables** while htmLawed is at work. Values of any pre-existing global variables with same names are noted, and their values are restored after htmLawed finishes processing the input (to capture the *finalized* values, the show\_settings parameter of $config should be used). Depending on $config, another global variable hl\_Ids, to track id attribute values for uniqueness, may be set. Unlike the other two variables, this one is not reset (or unset) post-processing.

  Except for the main htmLawed() function, htmLawed's functions are **name-spaced** using the hl\_ prefix. The **functions** and their roles are:

  \*  hl\_attributeValue - check attribute values against $spec rules

  \*  hl\_balance - balance tags and ensure proper nesting

  \*  hl\_commentCdata - handle CDATA sections and HTML comments

  \*  hl\_deprecatedElement - transform element tags

  \*  hl\_entity - handle character entities

  \*  hl\_regex - check syntax of a regular expression

  \*  hl\_spec - convert $spec value to one used internally

  \*  hl\_tag - handle element tags and attributes

  \*  hl\_tidy - compact/beautify HTML

  \*  hl\_url - check URL-containing values

  \*  hl\_version - report htmLawed version

  \*  htmLawed - main function

  htmLawed() finalizes $spec (with the help of hl\_spec()) and $config, and globalizes them. Finalization of $config involves setting default values if an inappropriate or invalid one is supplied. This includes calling hl\_regex() to check well-formedness of regular expression patterns if such expressions are user-supplied through $config. htmLawed() then removes invalid characters like nulls and x01 and appropriately handles entities using hl\_entity(). HTML comments and CDATA sections are identified and treated as per $config with the help of hl\_commentCdata(). When retained, the < and > characters identifying them, and the <, > and & characters inside them, are replaced with control characters (code-points 1 to 5) till any tag balancing is completed.

  After this *initial processing* htmLawed() identifies tags using regex and processes them with the help of hl\_tag() --  a large function that analyzes tag content, filtering it as per HTML standards, $config and $spec. Among other things, hl\_tag() transforms deprecated elements using hl\_deprecatedElement(), removes attributes from closing tags, checks attribute values as per $spec rules using hl\_attributeValue(), and checks URL protocols using hl\_url(). htmLawed() performs tag balancing and nesting checks with a call to hl\_balance(), and optionally compacts/beautifies the output with proper white-spacing with a call to hl\_tidy(). The latter temporarily replaces white-space, and <, > and & characters inside pre, script and textarea elements, and HTML comments and CDATA sections with control characters (code-points 1 to 5, and 7).

  htmLawed permits the use of custom code or **hook functions** at two stages. The first, called inside htmLawed(), allows the input text as well as the finalized $config and $spec values to be altered right after the initial processing (see [section 3.7](#s3.7)). The second is called by hl\_tag() once the tag content is finalized (see [section 3.4.9](#s3.4.9)).

  The functionality of htmLawed is dictated by the external HTML standards. The code of htmLawed is thus written for a clear-cut aim, with not much concern for tweaking by other developers. The code is only minimally annotated with comments -- it is not meant to instruct. PHP developers familiar with the HTML specifications will see the logic, and others can always refer to the htmLawed documentation.
