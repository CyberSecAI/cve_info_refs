  "CVE-2009-0404": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "htmLawed's new release addresses a vulnerability where maliciously crafted, syntactically invalid CSS expressions in style attributes could be executed by Internet Explorer.",
     "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from htmLawed's insufficient sanitization of dynamic CSS expressions within HTML `style` attributes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Lack of validation for dynamic CSS expressions"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML containing the vulnerable `style` attribute via comment sections, user input fields, or other means to manipulate the website's rendering.",
		"An attacker would specifically need to craft dynamic CSS expressions that bypass initial sanitization attempts."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to insert malicious HTML or control content used on the website.",
		"The attacker would require knowledge of how to create dynamic CSS expressions that could be executed in Internet Explorer and exploit htmLawed's lack of specific checks."
      ],
	   "additional_notes": "The vulnerability specifically affects Internet Explorer, as other browsers may handle dynamic CSS expressions differently. htmLawed's update aims to neutralize these expressions and improve security. The new release has an improved ability to catch malicously crafted but syntactically invalid dynamic CSS expressions."
