How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Version history

## easyHDR software updates and new features

| **3.16.2** - 27.06.2024: New features  * Added AVIF image loading support (\*.avif images, with AV1 compression). Supported natively on macOS 13 (Ventura) and later. In case of Windows, the required system   version is Windows 10 1903 or newer, but required is also "AV1 Video Extensions" codec utility by "Microsoft Corporation" (free, via Microsoft Store), if not already installed in the system.  Improvements  * Distortion correction in the crop tool is now split into two separate, X and Y values, allowing better adjustment of photographs taken with fish-eye lenses, * Fixed and improved flat frame calibration of RAWs. It was not working properly in case of some cameras due to bad black level (bias) value that was being assumed, * Added EXIF transfer option "Keep MakerNotes". Enabled by default (as it always used to be). Uncheck to fix issues with segmented EXIF being not recognized by some other software, * Use "Flash Exposure Compensation" value when calculating EV, * Improved preview for the sharpening effect being applied at tone mapping stage,  Other changes  * Corrected linear mode of chromatic aberration correction, * Fixed issues with handling huge photos (arithmetic limits), * Fixed stability issue in batch processing, * Updated LensFun database with new camera and lens definitions for lens correction, * Updated LibRAW for new camera RAW support, * Updated Exiftool. |
| --- |

Image files without archive attribute are now recognized. * Windows Vista: corrected detection of the number of CPU cores. * Added \*.rw2 extension to the list of supported RAW formats. |
| **1.60.1** - 13.12.2008: New features  * New HDR generation method - "Smart Merge". Generates a pseudo-HDR image that contains best exposed details taken from the input photographs. This method can produce very realistic results. Also the results look good just with the default settings, so less tweaking is needed. * Support for multicore CPUs. It is possible to select the maximum number of cores to be used in the normal or in the batch mode separately. * New translation: Brazilian!  Improvements  * The program works much faster (even when using single CPU core). The highest improvement in performance has been achieved in case of image loading (JPEG, TIFF & RAW), and in case of LDR enhancement (3-5x faster). However other functions like tone mapping, alignment, image transformation and HDR generation are now also at least several percent faster. * New format (XML) for tone mapping settings files, batch job lists and project files. XML means more flexibility and that the files could be edited with a simple text editor - like Notepad. * Completely redesigned batch processing window. * Zooming with mouse wheel. * Recently used tone mapping settings file list is saved when the program is terminated. * Possibility to use both: dot or a comma as a decimal separator.

It is useful especially in case of scenes with cloudy sky or fine detailed textures. It is very sensitive, so making the effect too strong can bring out noise or JPEG compression artifacts, especially on flat surfaces like blue, cloudless sky. * Full EXIF data transfer from JPEG, TIFF and RAW formats to JPEG and TIFF (installation of an additional program: EXIFTOOL is needed). * Color tone adjustment in post-processing. Possibility to tweak color saturation selectively for highlights and shadows as well as possibility to adjust color temperature. * Russian translation!  Improvements  * Improved histogram tool. * Extended capabilities of the cropping tool. * Improved image selection creation. Possibility to move the selection with the mouse while holding the Shift key. * Choosing the preview in manual alignment: buttons instead of a combo-box. * Hiding mouse cursor while moving pins in the manual alignment. * After a cursor key is pressed while moving a pin in the manual alignment, the following mouse movements are not used for updating the pin position.

User defined selectiveness - stronger effect for brighter or darker areas. * Showing an effect strength map for White Balance as well as Sample/Target Balance tools. * Image Stacking now possible also in the batch processing mode.  Corrected bugs  * The "Add directory" option now correctly adds directories that have an "archive" attribute. * Repaired copying to clipboard. |
| **1.41** - 04.12.2007: New features  * Image stacking - calculation of simple average of input photos instead of generating HDR. This feature shall be used with noisy photo sequences taken at the same exposure settings, however could give good results also with bracketed shots. * Additional option in the Manual Alignment tool - possibility to compensate for shift and rotation only, without scaling. * Possibility to move the pins in the Manual Alignment tool with keyboard arrows. Click with the mouse on the pin and while still holding the mouse button use the arrows. * The program warns if the user tries to save the result photo when the size reduction is enabled. * Possibility to turn off some of the confirmation dialogs, i.e. when a new project is started.  Improvements  * The memory usage is smaller, so bigger photos can be processed. With the /3GB switch enabled it is possible to process photos even bigger than 50MPix. * The program windows don't pop up during the batch processing any more. So, during the batch processing, other applications can be used without interruption.  Corrected bugs  * The program will finally work on systems with /3GB switch enabled. * Default values in the tone mapping settings are now written with the proper decimal separator - as defined in the Regional Settings in Windows. * Corrected bugs in the RAW loader and converter - long paths or filenames (not in 8.3 format) shouldn't be a problem any more. * DCRAW should work on Windows Vista. * Temporary TIFFs created by DCRAW are now properly deleted during the batch processing. * TIFFs saved with AutoPano software will now load without problems. * The "Maximal image dimension" setting in the "Program Options->Automatic size reduction" is now working. |

Improvements  * Modified tone mapping mask calculation procedures - faster and more universal. * Windows XP theme support - new, modern look. * Modified anti-blooming "slight" setting. * No more long program window freezing while image loading and RAW conversion. * Faster image loading and saving. * Redesigned batch processing window. * Opacity setting in the white balance and sample/target balance tools. * Help hints for the most important settings.  Corrected bugs  * Possibility to run many instances of the program (i.e. two easyHDR's running in batch processing mode to more efficiently use the multi core processor capabilities). * Loading RAW files from root directory (i.e. "C:\"). * The program crashes no more when HDR is regenerated and the size reduction is other than 1x. * Corrected sample tool in the white balance and sample/target balance. * Possibility to process \*.hdr photos in the batch processing mode. |
| **1.32** - 24.06.2007:  * Possibility to break tone mapping and HDR generation. * Automatic size reduction and preview calculation after HDR is generated (configured in the 'Program Options'). * 3-channel or luminance only histogram (click in order to change). * Resizeable open and save picture windows. * Direct raw photo loading with DCRAW. * Reading the EXIF tags from TIFF (and RAW). * Better tone mapping sliders. * Underexposed and overexposed areas marker (blinking). * Bug correction: Now it is possible to convert many files with the RAW converter in one batch. * A dozen other, but minor modifications. * New language versions: Portuguese and Italian! |
| **1.31** - 21.04.2007:  * More sophisticated auto-alignment feature - now there is an option to compensate rotation   between the images. May be useful with hand-held photo sequences. * Crop tool. * Corrected window behavior. No freezes during HDR generation, no problems with using other   applications during photo loading and HDR generation, no half-destroyed windows that cannot   be closed. * Better noise reduction capability when the "normal" anti-blooming is chosen. * Corrected bug - wrong EXIF data if "Remove" button was used. * Corrected bug - spin edit control in the slider popups. * Corrected bug - now it is possible to do LDR enhancement in the batch processing. * New version of dcraw (program that is used to convert RAW to TIFF) - it should work with   photos taken with more recent cameras. * Corrected bug with BMP or JPEG saving - occurred on Windows 2003 Server and there has   been one report that also on Windows XP. * Corrected auto file name suggestion. * Correction of the photos loading order. * Corrected German and French language versions. |
| **1.30** - 08.02.2007: New HDR generation and tone mapping algorithms - more realistic results, anti blooming feature. About 30% lower memory usage, so now it should be possible to load much bigger input photos. Image transformations (rotate and mirror). Automatic histogram clipping (white and black point). Auto alignment (for now translational only). Much improved toolbar and extended abilities of settings sliders. Preview size reduction - it is possible to process a resampled version of the HDR during tone mapping settings tuning instead of the entire photo. Possibility to hide the right panel, go back to the default settings, revert settings... |
| **1.24** - 21.12.2006: Bigger open and save picture windows. Bigger and more handy sliders. Real saturation parameter instead of the "old saturation" tool that is since now called "compression". New language version: easyHDR in French. |
| **1.23** - 06.12.2006: Additional language versions (German & Spanish). Added JPEG EXIF headers transfer capability. Corrected auto-preview feature. Some other minor changes like progress window showing up when photos are loaded. |
| **1.22** - 11.11.2006: Much faster (3-8x) tone mapping with the Gaussian and bilateral shadows/highlights mask. New tone mapping method - combination of results created with the Gaussian and bilateral masks. Automatic preview option. The preview area is updated automatically when one of the tone mapping parameters is changed. Also, a bug preventing RAW conversion has been repaired. The bug concerned cases when there were spaces in the RAW file path name. |
| **1.21** - 19.10.2006: JPEG error #36 issue has been resolved. Two bugs that were causing crash in Sample/Target Balance have been repaired. Result saving settings (like JPEG quality or TIFF compression) are now saved and restored as program starts. |
| **1.20** - 28.09.2006: The 'Step 3' tab has been redesigned and two new tools have been added to it. The new tools allow color tone adjustment to the tone mapped image. More on that can be found in the documentation. Also DCRAW integration with easyHDR has been improved and the DCRAW converter has been updated to the most recent version (which finally works fine also on Windows 2003 Server). Some additional minor changes like: new cursors, '1:1' and 'fit to screen' zoom buttons. |
| **1.19** - 13.08.2006: Added Radiance RGBE (\*.HDR) file format support and a built-in RAW image converter (to 48-bit TIFF). Tone mapping (especially bilateral method) is much faster. Now it's possible to load many images at once (by multiselecting them). Some other, but minor changes and bug fixes. |
| **1.18** - 06.07.2006: Batch processing, project save/load, tone mapping settings save/load. |
| **1.17** - 13.06.2006: No crash during processing if "Auto Add" is checked before the first image is opened. Status of "Auto Add" and "Shadows/Highlights Mask" checkboxes is saved on exit and restored when the program starts. |
| **1.16** - 05.06.2006: Two bugs corrected - crash when bilateral tone mapping was applied at low edge value and a crash on loading some TIFF images i.e. saved in PTGui). |
| **1.15** - 14.05.2006: TIFF format support added. You can load 24, 48 or 96-bit (HDR floating-point) uncompressed or compressed with "deflate" method TIFF images. The tonemapped result can be saved as 24 or 48-bit TIFF (with or without compression). |
| **1.14** - 04.05.2006: If you have purchased or you are going to purchase easyHDR please be sure that you have downloaded at least v1.14. A small bug that could occur on some computers has been repaired. This error affected only a licensed version. |
| **1.12** - 30.04.2006: The most time consuming procedures as tone mapping and filtering are executed in a thread that works in the background so the application window does not freeze during processing. The median filter functionality has been improved (opacity and threshold parameters added). |
| **1.11** - 12.04.2006: Bug correction. Now the program can be used at other screen dpi resolutions (eg. 120 dpi), not only at 96 dpi. |
| **1.10** - 07.04.2006: New tone tmapping algorithm (shadows/highlights mask) - allows much greater contrast reduction between bright and dark areas, but preserves local contrasts, so the images look really neat. Corrected filters (gauss, bilateral and unsharp mask) - now they are faster and have greater functionality (opacity, amount values). Auto add feature (can be used if there is no shift between images to be stacked). |
| **1.04** - 25.02.2006: New stacking and tone mapping method that does not loose color information and allows higher contrast. Corrected gamma adjustment and some minor bugs. (LAST FREE VERSION). |
| **1.03** - 08.02.2006: No image size limit, image alignment with a mouse, contrast enhancement - setting points on the histogram. |
| **1.02** - 04.02.2006: Two errors in image shift procedures corrected. |
| **1.01** - 03.02.2006: New compilation (for 6MPix images). |
| **1.00** - 03.02.2006: First release. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
