## 2. Avaya System Products using a Sun Microsystems Operating System:

Some Avaya system products are
delivered with an Operating System
from Sun Microsystems. Actions to be
taken on these products are described
below.

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya CMS | R15 | Low | This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya IR | 3.0, 4.0 | Low | IR does not use or support libpng by default. Avaya will not test patch for use with IR. |

**Recommended Actions:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libpng: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200903-28**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libpng, which might result in the
execution of arbitrary code

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.35** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.35** |

### Background

libpng is the official PNG reference library used to read, write and
manipulate PNG images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libpng:

* A
  memory leak bug was reported in png\_handle\_tEXt(), a function that is
  used while reading PNG images (CVE-2008-6218).
* A memory
  overwrite bug was reported by Jon Foster in png\_check\_keyword(), caused
  by writing overlong keywords to a PNG file (CVE-2008-5907).
* A
  memory corruption issue, caused by an incorrect handling of an out of
  memory condition has been reported by Tavis Ormandy of the Google
  Security Team. That vulnerability affects direct uses of
  png\_read\_png(), pCAL chunk and 16-bit gamma table handling
  (CVE-2009-0040).

### Impact

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user opening a specially crafted PNG file by exploiting the erroneous
out-of-memory handling. An attacker may also exploit the
png\_check\_keyword() error to set arbitrary memory locations to 0, if
the application allows overlong, user-controlled keywords when writing
PNG files. The png\_handle\_tEXT() vulnerability may be exploited by an
attacker to potentially consume all memory on a users system when a
specially crafted PNG file is opened.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.35"
```

firefox security update (RHSA-2009-0315)

Original Release Date: March 5, 2009

Last Revised: March 5, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-069

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2009-0040](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0040), [CVE-2009-0771](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0771), [CVE-2009-0772](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0772), [CVE-2009-0773](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0773), [CVE-2009-0774](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0774) and [CVE-2009-0775](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0775) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. A
website containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2009-0776](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0776) and [CVE-2009-0777](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0777) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0315.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

More details about the issues may be found on the Mozilla web site:    http://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/seamonkey11.html   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/seamonkey-1.1.15-i486-1_slack12.2.tgz:   Upgraded to seamonkey-1.1.15.   This release fixes some more security vulnerabilities.   For more information, see:     http://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/seamonkey11.html   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:15:32 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached tcl-8.3.3.ebuild and tk-8.3.3.ebuild.  These ebuilds accomplish the following:  1. split the tcl and tk packages into separate ebuilds. This makes writing ebuilds for packages that depend on tcl and/or tk much easier to handle (see expect-5.33.0.ebuild post and the vim-6.0-r2.ebuild patch attached).  I recommend putting the tcl ebuild under dev-lang/tcl and the tk ebuild under dev-tcltk/tk.   2. ebuilds are now version independent.   Renaming ebuilds to *-8.4.2.ebuild should work.  I have not tested this, but these ebuilds were based on the tcl-tk-8.4.2.ebuild.  3. The original tcl-tk-8.3.3.ebuild did not install the private headers and config.sh's for tcl and tk.  This is why vim-6.0-r2.ebuild did not work with 'use tcltk'  4. Promotes world peace and smells minty fresh.  Splitting up tcl and tk into separate ebuilds may cause some minor pain updating the dependencies of ebuilds that depend on them, but I think it is worth it in the long run.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 19:16:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 12](attachment.cgi?id=12 "tcl-8.3.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=12&action=edit "tcl-8.3.3.ebuild")] tcl-8.3.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:35:40 UTC  ``` Accepting bug.  I have tested on my box, and it works just fine there.  Committing. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Damon Conway (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-09 14:37:31 UTC  ``` Committed ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dhcp
By sending requests with a large value for 'dhcp-max-message-size'
dhcp-clients could crash dhcpd if dhcpd was configured with a large
amount of DHCP options (CVE-2007-0062).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- ntp/xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
Packages for SLES10 got delayed due a fix for another problem and
will follow soon
- squid
A denial of service condition in HTTP-request processing
was fixed in squid (CVE-2009-0478).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1
- wireshark
wireshark could crash while reading capture files containing
NetScreen data (CVE-2009-0599), while reading Tektronix K12 capture
files (CVE-2009-0600) or if the HOME environment variable contained
format string specifiers (CVE-2009-0601).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libpng
Specially crafted png files could crash applications using libpng or
potentially execute arbitrary code by causing free of an
uninitialized pointer (CVE-2009-0040).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- pam\_mount
Temporary file handling of the passwdehd script was prone to symlink
attacks (CVE-2008-5138). In 11.0 and 11.1 the script was removed as
it doesn't work on those distributions anyways.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- enscript
long path names could overflow a buffer in enscript (CVE-2008-5078).
Affected Products: SLES9
- eID-belgium
eID-belgium didn't properly check the return value of the openssl
function EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0049).
Affected Products: SLES10, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-good
Specially crafted QuickTime media files could cause heap based
buffer overflows in gstreamer. Attackers could potentially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0386, CVE-2009-0387,
CVE-2009-0397).
Affected Products: SLES9, openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported mail client.

For the testing (squeeze) distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Mozilla Firefox Browser was refreshed to the current MOZILLA\_1\_8
branch state around fix level 2.0.0.22, backporting various security
fixes from the Firefox 3.0.8 browser version.
Security issues identified as being fixed are:
MFSA 2009-01 / CVE-2009-0352 / CVE-2009-0353: Mozilla developers
identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used
in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes
showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and
we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be
exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2009-07 / CVE-2009-0772 / CVE-2009-0774: Mozilla developers
identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used
in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes
showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and
we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be
exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2009-09 / CVE-2009-0776: Mozilla security researcher Georgi
Guninski reported that a website could use nsIRDFService and a
cross-domain redirect to steal arbitrary XML data from another domain,
a violation of the same-origin policy. This vulnerability could be used
by a malicious website to steal private data from users authenticated
to the redirected website.
MFSA 2009-10 / CVE-2009-0040: Google security researcher Tavis
Ormandy reported several memory safety hazards to the libpng project,
an external library used by Mozilla to render PNG images. These
vulnerabilities could be used by a malicious website to crash a
victim's browser and potentially execute arbitrary code on their
computer. libpng was upgraded to version 1.2.35 which contains fixes
for these flaws.
MFSA 2009-12 / CVE-2009-1169: Security researcher Guido Landi
discovered that a XSL stylesheet could be used to crash the browser
during a XSL transformation. An attacker could potentially use this
crash to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
This vulnerability was also previously reported as a stability problem
by Ubuntu community member, Andre. Ubuntu community member Michael
Rooney reported Andre's findings to Mozilla, and Mozilla community
member Martin helped reduce Andre's original test case and contributed
a patch to fix the vulnerability.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Package        : libpng
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2445 CVE-2007-5269 CVE-2008-1382 CVE-2008-5907 CVE-2008-6218 CVE-2009-0040
Debian Bug     : 446308 476669 516256 512665

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng, a library for
reading and writing PNG files. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

The png_handle_tRNS function allows attackers to cause a denial of
service (application crash) via a grayscale PNG image with a bad tRNS
chunk CRC value. (CVE-2007-2445)

Certain chunk handlers allow attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via crafted pCAL, sCAL, tEXt, iTXt, and ztXT chunking in PNG
images, which trigger out-of-bounds read operations. (CVE-2007-5269)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a PNG file with zero
length "unknown" chunks, which trigger an access of uninitialized
memory. (CVE-2008-1382)

The png_check_keyword might allow context-dependent attackers to set the
value of an arbitrary memory location to zero via vectors involving
creation of crafted PNG files with keywords. (CVE-2008-5907)

A memory leak in the png_handle_tEXt function allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) via a crafted
PNG file. (CVE-2008-6218)

libpng allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PNG
file that triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the
png_read_png function, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit
gamma tables. (CVE-2009-0040)

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version1.2.15~beta5-1+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny2.  (Only CVE-2008-5907, CVE-2008-5907 and
CVE-2009-0040 affect the stable distribution.)

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.35-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.

# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5”, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
“>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5”, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# About the security content of Safari 4.0

This document describes the security content of Safari 4.0.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222)."

#### Safari 4.0

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1704

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Downloaded image files may be misidentified as HTML, leading to JavaScript execution without warning the user

  Description: Image files are 'safe' types that, once downloaded, are displayed by Safari without warning the user. An issue in Safari may cause it to be unable to identify the file type of certain local image files. In this case, Safari will examine the content of those files and may treat them as HTML. If a file contains JavaScript, it will be executed in the local context. For a downloaded file, this should not occur without first prompting the user. This issue is addressed by treating files of unknown type as generic binary data, and by correctly identifying the image file types known to have this issue. Credit to Sergio 'shadown' Alvarez of Recurity Labs GmbH for reporting this issue.

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1716

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: A local user may be able to read the contents of files being downloaded by other users

  Description: CFNetwork creates temporary files insecurely when downloading. A local user may be able to access another user's files as they are downloaded, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by downloading files to the user's secure temporary directory location. For Mac OS X systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.6. Credit to Billy Rios and Microsoft Vulnerability Research for reporting this issue.

Credit to Michal Zalewski of Google Inc. for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1705

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A memory corruption issue exists in the handling of TrueType fonts. An arithmetic issue in the automatic hinting of fonts may cause memory corruption. Visiting a maliciously crafted website with embedded fonts may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved input validation of TrueType font data. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems. Credit to Clint Ruoho of Laconic Security and Tavis Ormandy of Google Security Team for reporting this issue.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0946

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType v2.3.8

  Description: Multiple integer overflows exist in FreeType v2.3.8, that may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.

Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues through improved bounds and error checking. For Mac OS X v10.5 systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.5.7. For Mac OS X v10.4.11 systems, this issue is addressed in Security Update 2009-002.

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1179

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An integer overflow exists in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files containing JBIG2 streams. Opening a PDF file containing a maliciously crafted JBIG2 stream may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Will Dormann of CERT/CC for reporting this issue.

* **ImageIO**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0040

  Available for: Windows XP or Vista

  Impact: Processing a maliciously crafted PNG image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An uninitialized pointer issue exists in the handling of PNG images.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Mozilla Firefox browser is updated to version 3.0.7 fixing various
security and stability issues.
Updates are provided for openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1 currently, backports
for other Mozilla Firefox browsers and Mozilla Suite programs will
follow.
MFSA 2009-07 / CVE-2009-0771 / CVE-2009-0772 / CVE-2009-0773 /
CVE-2009-0774: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several
stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory
corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough
effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2009-08 / CVE-2009-0775: An anonymous researcher, via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative program, reported a vulnerability in
Mozilla's garbage collection process. The vulnerability was caused by
improper memory management of a set of cloned XUL DOM elements which
were linked as a parent and child. After reloading the browser on a
page with such linked elements, the browser would crash when attempting
to access an object which was already destroyed. An attacker could
use this crash to run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2009-09 / CVE-2009-0776: Mozilla security researcher Georgi
Guninski reported that a website could use nsIRDFService and a
cross-domain redirect to steal arbitrary XML data from another domain,
a violation of the same-origin policy. This vulnerability could be used
by a malicious website to steal private data from users authenticated
to the redirected website.
MFSA 2009-10 / CVE-2009-0040: libpng maintainer Glenn Randers-Pehrson
reported several memory safety hazards in PNG libraries used by
Mozilla. These vulnerabilities could be used by a malicious website
to crash a victim's browser and potentially execute arbitrary code
on their computer. libpng was upgraded to a version which contained
fixes for these flaws.
MFSA 2009-11 / CVE-2009-0777: Mozilla contributor Masahiro Yamada
reported that certain invisible control characters were being decoded
when displayed in the location bar, resulting in fewer visible
characters than were present in the actual location. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to spoof the location bar and display
a misleading URL for their malicious web page.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## libpng fails to properly initialize element pointers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#649212

Original Release Date: 2009-03-02 | Last Revised: 2009-03-06

---

### Overview

Libpng contains a vulnerability in the way element pointers are handled.

### Description

| A vulnerability in the way libpng handles element pointers may result in uninitialized element pointers. This vulnerability is due to an off-by-one error introduced in multiple functions in libpng-0.89c. According to the [PNG Development Group](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngnews.html):  *If the application runs out of memory during the loop, some of the element pointers will be uninitialized. Libpng will then longjmp to a cleanup process that attempts to free all of the elements in the array, including the uninitialized ones. This behavior could be forced by a malevolent input.*Note that this issue affects all versions of libpng prior to libpng-1.0.43 and libpng-1.2.35. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade** The [PNG Development Group](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngnews.html) has issued an upgrade to address this issue. See [libpng version 1.2.35](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) for more information. |

##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver vulnerability may cause a denial of service in Windows based virtual machines.

The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is an optional,
experimental service that provides improved guest operating system
accounting.
This patch fixes a denial of service vulnerability that could be
triggered in a virtual machine by an unprivileged, locally
logged-on user in the virtual machine.
Virtual machines are affected under the following conditions:
- The virtual machine is running a Windows operating system.
- The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver is installed
in the virtual machine. Note that this is an optional (non-
default) part of the VMware Tools installation.
- The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is not running
in the virtual machine
The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is no longer provided
in newer versions of VMware Tools, starting with the versions
released in Fusion 2.0.2 and ESX 4.0.
However, virtual machines migrated from vulnerable releases will
still be vulnerable if the three conditions listed above are met,
until their tools are upgraded.
Steps needed to remediate this vulnerability:
Guest systems on VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion
- Install the new version of Workstation, Player, ACE, Server,
Fusion (see below for version information)
- Upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine users
will be prompted to upgrade).
Guest systems on ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3
- Install the relevant patches (see below for patch identifiers)
- Manually upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine
users will not be prompted to upgrade). Note the VI Client will
not show the VMware tools is out of date in the summary tab.
Please see <http://tinyurl.com/27mpjo> page 80 for details.
Guests systems on ESX 4.0 and ESXi 4.0 that have been migrated from
ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, and ESX 3.0.x
- Install/upgrade the new tools in the virtual machine (virtual
machine users will be prompted to upgrade).
If the Descheduled Time Accounting driver was installed, the tools
upgrade will result in an updated driver for Workstation, Player,
ACE, Server, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3, ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5. For Fusion,
ESX 4.0, and ESXi 4.0 the tools upgrade will result in the removal
of the driver.
VMware would like to thank Nikita Tarakanov for reporting this
issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1805 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available. See above for remediation

b. Updated libpng package for the ESX 2.5.5 Service Console

The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.
A flaw was discovered in libpng that could result in libpng trying
to free() random memory if certain, unlikely error conditions
occurred. If a carefully-crafted PNG file was loaded by an
application linked against libpng, it could cause the application
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.
A flaw was discovered in the way libpng handled PNG images
containing "unknown" chunks. If an application linked against libpng
attempted to process a malformed, unknown chunk in a malicious PNG
image, it could cause the application to crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-0040 and CVE-2008-1382 to these
issues.
The VMware version number of libpng after applying the update is
libpng-1.0.14-12.i386.rpm.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available.
