- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `autor.php` script in OwnRS Blog 1.2 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `id` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. They could also gain access to sensitive information such as database credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious crafted request to the `autor.php` script, modifying the `id` parameter to include SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be off for the exploit to work.
