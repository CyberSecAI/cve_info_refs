## Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0095

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office Visio validates object data when opening up Visio files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file which could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.

If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0095](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0095).

#### Mitigating Factors for Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0095

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Attacker can only gain the privileges of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message. The attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0095

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open Visio files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
