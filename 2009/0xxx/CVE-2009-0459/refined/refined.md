Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-0459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the WholeHogSoftware Password Protect application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can bypass the login authentication mechanism of the application. This allows unauthorized access to the administrative panel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Password Protect application, specifically the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to inject SQL code into the username and password fields. The exploit shows the injected values to be: `' or '1=1`.

**Summary of Exploit:**

The provided exploit utilizes the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass the authentication mechanism. By entering `' or '1=1` in both the username and password fields, the attacker modifies the underlying SQL query to always return true, thus granting access to the administrative panel without knowing the actual credentials.
