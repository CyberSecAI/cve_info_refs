[ABTRACTS]
Biometrics has nowadays been of universal interest and has been developed and used
for  many  purposes  such  as  for  the  detection  of  criminals  and  undesirables,
identification  and access  control.  Within this  paper, we would  like to  concern  about
Facial  Cognitive  Biometric  Systems  and  their  application  in  User  Authentication
Based on Face Recognition.

The  most  well-knowned  authentication  system  to  many  people  is  the  user
authentication  mechanisms  on  PCs,  which  make  use  of  Username  and  Password.
Other than that, fingerprint authentication is also widely used. Yet as users’ demands
are so diversified, they are caring more and more about face authentication due to the
fact that it is a hands-free and user friendly way to logon.

Lenovo, Asus, and Toshiba are known as the first three big computer manufacturers to
put that technology into practical use and to bring about greater convenience for their
customers.  The  one  question  to  ask  is  whether  such  technology  is  really  safe  and
secure for its users to enjoy. Our research, which is concluded in this paper, will prove
that  the  mechanisms  used  by  those  three  vendors  haven’t  met  the  security
requirements  needed  by  an  authentication  system  and  that  they  cannot  wholly
protected their users from being tampered.

I. BIOMETRICS & SECURITY

1. Biometrics
Biometrics  includes  the  study  of  methods  for  uniquely  recognizing  humans  based
upon one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits such as eye iris, voice tones,
palm print, face outline...

Biometric  Technologies  fill  the  role  of  analyzing  and  measuring  unique  biological
properties  in  order  to  produce  unique  identifications  which  is  then  digitalized  and
stored.

Biometrics can be divided into two main classes:
    -  Physiological biometrics is related to the shape of the body:

• Face Recognition
• Finger-scan
• Iris-scan
• Retina-scan
• Hand-scan
• ADN.

    - Behavioral biometrics is related to the behavior of a person.

• Voice-scan
• Signature-scan
• Keystroke-scan

This  paper  would  discuss  about  face  recognition  in  details  and  its  application  in
authentication systems.

2. Access Control System using Face Recognition
Face recognition applications are more and more being taken interest in and developed
since [1] [2] [7]:

-  They are non-intrusive.
-  Biometric data of the faces (photos, videos) can be easily taken with available

devices like cameras.

-  One biometric data is used in many different environments.
-  And  facial  recognition  sounds  rather  interesting  in  comparison  with  other

biometric technologies.

Therefore,  face  recognition  has  been  widely  used  in  identification  and  access
management.

At the moment, there have been a lot of researches on access control applications and
those have been utilized in personal computers’ and handheld devices’ authentication.
They  are  also  integrated  into  office  and  home  access  control  systems.  We  will  talk
further  about  applications  of  face  recognition  in  access  control  systems  and  their
security drawbacks.

II. FACE AUTHENTICATION

1. Model
The following figure describes an access control system base on face authentication.
In this model, each user has an account and a corresponding ID in the Face Database.
On  a  user  logging  in  the  system,  Face  Authentication  will  use  face  recognition
technologies to analyze and determine his ID as well as his permissions on the system
[3] [4] [6].

Access Control System Based on Face Authentication Model

This  model  can be  applied  to  access  control  systems  where the number  of  people  is
small; for example, user accounts in an operating system, members of an office or a
family.

4

When receiving a request, an access control system based on face authentication must
find out exactly whether the person requesting is a client or an impostor. Right after
that, it decides whether to accept the login or to treat him/her as an impostor and cry
out "access denial"  [9].

In order for Face Authentication to satisfy all the security issues that an access control
system  asks  for,  the  face  recognition  algorithms  in  operation  must  be  almost
completely exact.

2. Algorithms in Use

2.1 Face Recognition Model
As  you  can  see  from  the  diagram  below,  face  recognition  requires  a  wide  range  of
technologies [5]:

Face Image/Video

Face Detection

Feature
Extraction

Feature Match

Face ID

Face Recognition Processing Flow

Database of
Enrolled Users

Face  recognition  systems  in  general,  and  access  control  systems  based  on  face
authentication  in  particular,  use  a  “learning”  mechanism  to  collect  data  on  facial
characteristics  if  users.  Hence,  the  first  important  point  to  care  about  in  a  face
recognition model is the Face Database storing this information.

When the  system  finishes scanning  a  video  or photo of  a  user’s  face,  the  digitalized
information will go through these following modules one after another:

-  Face  Detection:  locating  the  face  in  the  photo  or  video  and  removing

unnecessary details on the background.

-  Feature Extraction: extracting facial characteristics needed for recognition.
-  Feature  Match:  comparing  scanned  information  with  database  to  decide  if  it
matches some user’s face. If the face matched, the ID of the corresponding is
returned.

Most of  present  researches  try  to create  an  Automatic Face  Recognition  model.  The
hardest  part  of  it  is  how  to  get  best  biometric  information  on  the  faces.  Therefore,
Feature  Extraction  is  the  most  important  module  of  the  system.  In  the  next  section,
we will focus on basic algorithms used for extracting facial characteristics.

2.2 Face Recognition Algorithm

Geometric feature-based approach
In  the  1980s,  researches  on  face  recognition  were  mostly  based  on  the  geometric
characteristics of faces [5] [9] [10]. Using this approach, parts of human faces such as
eyes,  nose,  and  mouth  are  located  together  with  their  attributes  and  their  mutual
relationships  and  measurements  (distances,  angles,  areas).  The  system  will
distinguish faces based on this information. This approach is quite effective for small
database, with steady lighting and viewpoint. But it has lots of disadvantages:
-  Not effective for unstable lighting condition and changing viewpoint.
-  The scanning technology is not yet reliable.
-  The  information  extracted  is  not  enough  for  an  information-rich  organ  like

face.

Considering these disadvantages, this method is no longer used today.

Geometric feature-based approach

Appearance-based approach
At  the  beginning  of  1990s,  more  and  more  researchers  were  inspired  by  a  new
approach based on human appearance.. This technology transforms the face space into
subspaces which have less dimensions but those are the directions that depict the most
important parts of the face.

The studies that are talked about the most is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
KLT – Karhunen- Loève Transform [6] [11] [12] [13]. The following graphs show a
typical  example  of  PCA.  We  can  easily  spot  that  the  majority  of  2D  points  locate

6

close  to  the  the  1st  PC  line,  which  means  that  we  can  perform  a  projection  of  these
points on the 1st PC line without losing essential 2D information.

Principal Component Analysis Method

PCA  Method  uses  eigenvectors  and eigenvalues for  representing face  images.  These
eigenvectors  can  be  thought  of  as  a  set  of  features  which  together  characterize  the
variation  between  face  image.  Each  image  location  contributes  more  or  less  to  each
eigenvector, so that we can display the eigenvector as a sort of ghostly face which we
call an eigenface [11].

On the basis of PCA, other methods with higher efficiency have been developed:

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [14].

-
-  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), utilizing FisherFace Algorithm [15].
-  And other improvement established on subspace.

Appearance-based approaches have been able to extract quite enough information on
the  faces.  However,  they  haven’t  yet  worked  well  in  varied  lighting  conditions  and
especially have ignored non-linear variation of the faces.

Other approach
In order to solve the limitations of the Appearance-based approach, other approaches
have been proposed.

The  first  are  the  improved  methods  based  on  PCA,  PLA,  and  ICA  that  can  project
non-linear on the subspace, such as: Kernel PCA, Kernel LDA algorithm [5] [13].

To get rid of these limitations, Local appearance-based feature space technology with
a  huge  database  of  facial  characteristics  has  been  developed.  Some  methods  and
algorithms based on this technology are [5] [13]:
-  Local Features Analysis (LFA) method.
-  Gabor  wavelet-based  features  method  (same  with  Elastic  Graph  Bunch

Matching - EGBM).

-  Local Binary Pattern (LBP) method.

7

Moreover, as modern image capturing devices are becoming better and better, a new
method called 3D Face Recognition are becoming the new target [5] [13] [16] [17].

In  general,  face  recognition  technologies  have  been  improved  robustly  and  become
more accurate and effective. We have just talked about the most popular approaches
used  in  researches  on  algorithms  that  extract  the  facial  characteristics.  There  are
indeed  many  organizations  and  individuals  studying  this  problem  using  their  own
approaches but we cannot discuss here due to limited space.

3. Lenovo – Asus – Toshiba
The  previous  sections  have  introduced  the  access  control  systems  based  on  face
recognition and several basic algorithms in use. In this section, we will talk about the
access  control  system  provided  by  three  well-known  computer  manufacturers:
Lenovo, Asus and Toshiba.

Toshiba Face Recognition

This is the most complicated but the most secure of the three applications.

9

All of the three applications apply to access control system based on face recognition
on Windows installed on laptops of the three vendors. In general, these products can
recognize the real users when they want to log in.

However, when enjoying these systems, we sensed there something wrong and started
to wonder: “Does the solutions provided by the three vendors for their customers meet
the security needs of an access control system?”

III. BYPASSING

1. Drawbacks
On suspicion of these security capabilities of the three products talked above, we have
embarked  on  doing  a  research  on  those  and  quickly  found  weak  points  that  can  be
taken  advantages  of.  The  model  used  to  bypass  user  authentication  based  on  face
recognition of the threes is also discussed.

Let  us  present  the  security  threat  posed  to  Lenovo’s  –  Asus’s  –  Toshiba’s  products,
based  on  the  basis  face  recognition  algorithms  and  the  tests  we  have  performed  on
them:

-  Face Recognition in comparison with other biometric recognition systems
-
-
-

Influences of varied lighting
Influences of image capturing devices
Influences of Image Processing

Face Recognition in comparison with other biometric recognition
systems
The  following  table  shows  the  state  of  art  of  some  biometric  systems,  measured  n
2005.

Here come some terms used in the table [18]:
-  FRR: False Rejection Rate (FRR).
-  FAR: False Acceptance Rate (FAR).

State of art of biometric recognition systems

10

When concerning recognition systems, people often care  about how to  minimize the
FAR.  As  a  result,  in  Face  Recognition  Vendor  Test  (FRVT)  [24],  they  rated  the
performance  by  measuring  False  Rejection  Rate  (FRR)  regarding  a  definite  False
Acceptance Rate, which is small and acceptable. As for the above table, when FAR is
1%, FRR comes up to 10% for face recognition.

In practice, when implementing the algorithms, they usually have to balance between
FAR  and  FRR.  This  makes  the  efficiency  of  face  recognition  the  lowest  of  all
regarding the table. Its security is also lower than other biometric recognition system,
especially compared to fingerprint scan.

Influences of varied lighting
As introduced, the basis algorithms have not worked well when there are changes in
lighting. Many studies have been carried out in order to solve this problem [19][20],
but  no  thorough  solutions  have  appeared.  In  the  latest  performance  measurement
report of face recognition algorithms, the result was only good when the lighting did
not change. Does the solution proposed by the three vendors wipe those disadvantages
out?

Influences of image capturing devices
The algorithms applied to tested environments where the database in use was limited
and  the  images  had  high  resolutions  while  the  majority  of  cameras  produced  by  the
threes  have  low  resolution  (the  highest  is  only  1.3  Megapixel,  and  the  lowest  is  0.3
Megapixel). Might low resolution images become flaws that can be taken advantage
of?

Influences of Image Processing
One  special  point  we  found  out  when  studying  those  algorithms  is  that  all  of  them
work  with  images  that  have  already  been  digitalized  and  gone  through  image
processing.  Consequently,  we  think  that  this  is  the  weakest  security  spot  in  face
recognition  systems  generally  and  access  control  system  of  the  three  vendors
particularly.

2. Bypass Model
Based  on  the  previously  discussed  drawbacks,  we  built  a  bypass  model  to  test  the
products of the three vendors.

11

Bypass Model

The model exploits the flaw in image processing. In other words, it uses a photo of a
person  instead  of  his/her  real  face.  It  works  because  the  algorithms  will  process  in
effect digital information.

Provided those conditions, an attacker might take some photos of one user within the
system, perform some image editing, regenerate “special pictures” and penetrate into
the system.

3. Fake Face
This  section  covers  how  an  attacker  could  produce  a  fake  face  of  a  user  and  some
methods used to bypass the three access control systems of the three vendors.

3.1 How to get an target’s image
At the moment, it is very easy to get a photo of a person as everyone seems to have at
least once taken a photo. Moreover, there are lots of ways to obtain such photos, like
from  the  Internet  or  using  sophisticated  but  popular  devices.  Let  us  give  out  some
methods among those:

-  Webcam chat (MSN, Yahoo Messenger, AOL, Skype, ... )
-  Searching on the Internet, especially on personal website or blog making use of

Web 2.0 Technologies (Flickr, Yahoo Blog, Facebook ...).

-  Using camera with tele-lens to get a photo of the target from long distances.
-  Hacker asks that person to take a picture with him directly.
-  And many other methods ...

3.2 Fake Face Bruteforce
In  fact,  hacker  cannot  just  get  into  the  system  with  whichever  images  taken  from  a
user  because  the  lighting,  viewpoint  and  even  some  characteristics  of  that  person
might be different from those when the system learned his/her face.

12

To make sure that the photo would pass the checking of the application, hacker would
have  to  edit  it  to  adjust  the  lighting  and  the  viewpoint.  Due  to  the  fact  that  hacker
doesn’t know exactly how the face learnt by the system looks like, he has to create a
large  number  of  images  (Fake  Face)  -  let  us  call  this  method  of  attack  “Fake  Face
Bruteforce”. It is just easy to do that with a wide range of image editing programs at
the moment.

There are several things to concern about in image editing so as the BruteForce to be
successful, including:

-  The image’s viewpoint.
-  Lighting effect

4. Tests and results
Performing tests on laptops with 1.3 Megapixel camera produced by Lenovo – Asus –
Toshiba, using the Bypass Model above with photos or videos of some users, we have
been  able  to  pass  the  User  Authentication  Based  on  Face  Recognition  and  log  into
user accounts on Windows Vista without difficulty.

All the applications tested are of their latest versions and are set to Highest Security
Level.

-  Lenovo Veriface III
-  Asus SmartLogon V1.0.0005
-  Toshiba Face Recognition 2.0.2.32

Lenovo Veriface III
Veriface  provides  the  easiest  usage  amongst  the  three  applications  for  its  users  in
which users only have to take some photos of them and the result is stored as Black
and White images.

The introduction on Veriface III of Lenovo comes below [21]:
“Now  that  some  systems  include  integrated  cameras  with  much  better  quality
(1.3MP), facial recognition has become much better. The included  software lets you
log onto your Windows account simply by sitting in front of your system. Your face is
your password.”

Veriface is in fact the least secure of the threes as we can log into the account using a
plain image of the owner without much effort.

Asus SmartLogon V1.0.0005
Smart Logon uses a more complicated method of learning a user’s face. Thirty images
of the user, all of which are color, are saved as default. More images can be added to
the database to make it more reliable.

Here comes what Asus told about their SmartLogon [22]:

13

“It’s always more pleasant to be welcomed into an establishment where the manager
knows you by sight than it is to be aggressively prodded for ID by the security guard
at  the  door.  That’s  the  difference  a  notebook  with  ASUS  SmartLogon  with  face
recognition  technology  brings  to  the computing  experience.  With  ASUS  SmartLogon
with  face  recognition  technology,  users  waltz  past  the  notebook’s  security  functions
without lifting a finger.”

According to  the  test, it  is harder  to  bypass SmartLogon.  However,  by changing the
viewpoint  so  that  the  posture  looks  like  what  is  used  by  the  user  when  capturing
his/her face, it is yet not too hard to enter into the system.

Toshiba Face Recognition 2.0.2.32

This  seems  to  be  the  most  complicated  of  the  threes  since  users  have  to  move  their
head up and down in accord with the application’s requests. The results of the scan are
saved in the form of color images. All of these are to ensure that the database has a
wide range of viewpoint.

In  addition,  it  is  also  reported  in  the  FRVT  that  the  algorithm  proposed  by  Toshiba
had high performance in all of the tests.

Toshiba  has  had  some  attractive  words  in  their  advertisements  of  Face  Recognition
[23]:
“Toshiba  Face  Recognition  is  the  ultimate  hands-free,  hassle-free  way  to  logon  to
your  laptop.  No  keeping  track  of  hard-to-remember  passwords.  No  unnecessary
typing. Just your handsome visage gazing into the built-in Webcam on your notebook
and presto―you’ve got access! How’s that for sci-fi technology?”

This  application  is  in  effect  more  difficult  to  be  bypassed  compared  to  Veriface  of
Lenovo  and  SmartLogon  of  Asus.  However,  still  making  use  of  BruteForce  with  a
little  change  in  the  viewpoint  and  especially  the  lighting,  we  yet  succeeded  in
penetrating into the system.

Result estimation

The  following  table  shows  results  of  the  tests  on  the  Bypass  Model  performing  on
three applications, where:

-  BruteForce: trying to bypass using a lot of  face photos.
-  No BruteForce: trying to bypass using an arbitrary photo taken from a user.
-  High: easily being bypassed
-  Medium: somewhat more difficult to be bypassed
-  Low: cannot be bypassed

IV. CONCLUSION
In  this  paper,  we  have  introduced  basic  face  recognition  algorithms  as  well  as  their
applications  in  authenticating  users  based  on  their  faces  in  present  access  control
systems. We have also pointed out weak points that might allow one to bypass into the
systems of the three big computer manufacturers Lenovo – Asus – Toshiba.

The  main purpose of the paper is to give sufficient evidences that the authentication
technologies  being  used  by  these  three  manufacturers  are  not  efficient  and  secure
enough as they are prone to be bypassed putting users’ data at serious risk.
