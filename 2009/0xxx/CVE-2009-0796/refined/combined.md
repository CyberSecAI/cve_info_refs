| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=494402#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-06 18:06:00 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the httpd mod_perl Apache::Status module. If a site has the non default setting of making /perl-status page accessible, remote attackers could use that flaw to trick users or steal sensitive browser data.  The original public announcement can be found here: <http://marc.info/?l=apache-modperl&m=123862312808765&w=2>  The CVE id mentioned in the above mail is wrong, [CVE-2009-0796](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0796) is the proper CVE id.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=494402#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-06-10 17:45:32 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/perl/modperl/branches/1.x/lib/Apache/Status.pm?view=log&pathrev=761081>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=494402#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-06-10 18:08:51 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact, a future mod_perl package update may address this flaw. More information regarding issue severity can be found here: <http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>  Explanation: ------------ The vulnerability affects non default configuration of Apache HTTP web server, i.e cases, when access to Apache::Status and Apache2::Status resources is explicitly allowed via <Location /perl-status> httpd.conf  configuration directive.    Its occurrence can be prevented by using the default configuration for the Apache HTTP web server (not exporting /perl-status).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=494402#c4)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-04 22:34:20 UTC  ``` This also affects all current Fedora releases (10, 11, 12, and rawhide).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=494402#c6)  Joe Orton    2009-12-08 17:02:51 UTC  ``` Upstream trunk commit:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/perl/modperl/trunk/lib/Apache2/Status.pm?r1=607697>& r2=760926   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=494402#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-17 19:32:32 UTC  ``` This was fixed in Fedora a while ago:  * Tue Dec 08 2009 Joe Orton <jorton> - 2.0.4-10 - add security fix for [CVE-2009-0796](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0796) (#544455)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=494402#c9)  Josh Bressers    2011-08-15 19:12:09 UTC  ``` I'm closing this as wontfix. It's fixed in newer versions of mod_perl, the actual threat here is very minimal.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2009/CVE-2009-0796.html>

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy Heron): ignored (reached end-of-life)

I happily accept that the desktop version has reached end of life.

However the server version has support until April 2013.

The comment above says that the bug was fixed in 2.0.4 in February 2010, which was within the support period even for Hardy desktop!

What is the point of having LTS versions if you still fail to patch issues which have been fixed already in other versions within the support period!
