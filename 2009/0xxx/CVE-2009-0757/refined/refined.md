Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of string lengths within the `mpfr_snprintf` and `mpfr_vsnprintf` functions of the MPFR (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library). Specifically, the code did not ensure that null termination occurred within the bounds of the provided buffer, leading to potential buffer overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  The core issue is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability within the MPFR library's formatted output functions. When processing specially crafted data, these functions could write beyond the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could trigger the buffer overflow to crash the application that relies on the vulnerable MPFR library.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In a more severe scenario, a successful exploit of the buffer overflow could allow an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code. The code would run with the privileges of the user invoking the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Data:** The attack vector involves supplying a vulnerable application with specially crafted input strings designed to trigger the buffer overflow within the `mpfr_snprintf` or `mpfr_vsnprintf` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to a vulnerable application that utilizes the flawed MPFR library.  This could involve supplying manipulated data files, network requests containing specially crafted strings, or any other input method supported by the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in MPFR version 2.4.1.
*   Ubuntu addressed the issue in their security notice USN-772-1, with updated packages for Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty). The patched version of the `mpfr` package was 2.4.0-1ubuntu3.1.
