    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Stack overflow",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution.

      "E-mail attachments with specially crafted Word 97 files.",
      "Websites hosting malicious Word 97 documents."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Word 97 document and convince the victim to open it with WordPad. This could be through email, a malicious website, or compromised websites that host user-provided content."
