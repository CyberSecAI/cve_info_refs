      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-0592",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_6870dd9c_20250125_140830.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the 'ModName' parameter in several admin PHP files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include local files, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files or other system data. This can be used to gain further access or control over the affected system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to vulnerable PHP files, such as /admin/admin_words.php, /admin/admin_groups_reapir.php, etc., by manipulating the 'ModName' parameter to include a local file path."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as a requirement, suggesting this vulnerability may be exploitable without prior access."
