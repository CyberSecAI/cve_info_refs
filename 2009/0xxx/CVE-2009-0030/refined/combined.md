| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-17 17:38:25 UTC  ``` It was discovered that a backport of the patch for [CVE-2008-3663](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3663) included in SquirrelMail packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 contained a bug, that could result in different users being assigned insecure and identical session identifier.  Such session identifiers were assigned if user logged out of SquirrelMail and logged in again without closing web browser.  This could result in sessions of the multiple users to "merge".  Certain data from one user's session could have been displayed to other user (such as folder structure, address book and options, but not individual mails), or result in the overwrite of the preferences data with other user's settings.  Further details can be found in the [bug #480224](show_bug.cgi?id=480224 "CLOSED ERRATA - Squirrelmail session management broken by security backport").   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c3)  Josh Bressers    2009-01-19 20:57:01 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c4)  advax    2009-01-20 21:14:07 UTC  ``` We have seen the problems reported in #480224, and have rolled back from  to 1.4.8-4.0.1.el4 to 1.4.8-5.el4_7.2 on EL4.5 to resolve them. We have had user preferences become corrupted causing mail to be sent apparently from a different user, or duplicated "from" a second user.  When investigating I checked my cookies in Firefox which appeared to have "reasonable" values, deleted them, and logged in again to Squirrelmail. I noticed that I would be randomly logged out. Also on some occasions the list of subscribed folders in the left panel included folders belonging to another user, but if I clicked on them I got a "no such folder" error as they do not exist in my account.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-21 07:36:30 UTC  ``` Version 1.4.8-5.el4_7.2 is known to be affected by issues mentioned in the [bug #480224](show_bug.cgi?id=480224 "CLOSED ERRATA - Squirrelmail session management broken by security backport").  The update has been released to address them.  If you are still seeing some issue with latest packages, please file a bug against squirrelmail component, with detailed steps to reproduce.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c6)  Scott Dowdle    2009-01-27 16:11:46 UTC  ``` I'm running squirrelmail-1.4.8-5.el4_7.3 and I still have the issue.  I have had two users report that email they are sending is using the account information from another user.  I have logged in as them and verified that indeed all of the account settings information displayed is that of another user.  I'm wondering if this is a result of corruption or data alteration created by the previous version... affecting the current version.  In any event I have the latest version and a few users seem to have the problem.  I don't know how wide spread the issue is (it hasn't affected my account) but I have had two users report it... and as I said, I verified it.  Not sure where to do from here?  Should I wait for an update (is there going to be one)?  Should I rollback two versions (where there is a security issue)?  In the meantime, I'm just disabling the webmail system.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-27 17:42:24 UTC  ``` As noted in [bug #480224](show_bug.cgi?id=480224 "CLOSED ERRATA - Squirrelmail session management broken by security backport"), corruption of the user preferences files was one of the most severe symptoms of this flaw, causing one user's preferences to be written to preferences files of other user (you should be able to manually verify by inspecting individual files in /var/lib/squirrelmail/prefs/).  As was noted in the errata text, all users that have used affected version of squirrelmail (1.4.8-5.el4_7.2 on RHEL4) should review (and correct if needed) their preferences.  Alternatively, restore from backup can be used to revert all users preferences to known good state.  Updated packages make sure to immediately discard all bogus session identifier to avoid further corruptions, but can not undo changes that happened while broken packages were used.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c8)  Scott Dowdle    2009-01-27 17:58:32 UTC  ``` Tomas,  Thanks for responding to my recent addition to this bug report and bringing to my attention details I did not notice that were there.  I will follow those instructions and report any additional problems if I encounter them although I don't anticipate having them.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c9)  Red Hat Product Security    2009-02-26 09:17:49 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0057.html>   ``` |  |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements
for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low
profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on
our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache-jakarta-tomcat-connectors
Two old but not yet fixed security issues in tomcat5 were spotted and
are fixed by this update:
CVE-2006-3835: Apache Tomcat 5 before 5.5.17 allows remote attackers
to list directories via a semicolon (;) preceding a filename with
a mapped extension, as demonstrated by URLs ending with /;index.jsp
and /;help.do.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in certain applications
using Apache Tomcat allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via crafted "Accept-Language headers that do not
conform to RFC 2616".
These issues were rated "low" by the Apache Tomcat team.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement
is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into
a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all
over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to
the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You
can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end
of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c0)  Dan Astoorian    2009-01-15 19:08:11 UTC  ``` Description of problem: After upgrading to squirrelmail-1.4.8-5.el4_7.2, user sessions may inadvertently be created with a session ID of "deleted" instead of a random identifier; if this occurs with multiple users, they will each have the same session ID (of "deleted"), and information (e.g., folder lists) can leak from one user's instance to another's.  Other interference can also occur (e.g., a user ending their squirrelmail session will also log out other users with the same session ID).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): squirrelmail-1.4.8-5.el4_7.2  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Exit and restart your web browser, if needed. 2. Visit: <http://localhost/webmail/src/webmail.php>.  You will correctly get the "You must be logged in to access this page" error. 3. Click through to the login page and log in.    Actual results: If you examine the SQMSESSID cookie of the session, you will see that it has a value of "deleted".  Also, if you look in the PHP session directory (/var/lib/php/session/), you will see a session file called "sess_deleted" containing information related to the session.  Expected results: SQMSESSID should contain a randomly-generated session identifier, and /var/lib/php/session/sess_deleted should never be created.  Additional info: This did not occur in the previous release (squirrelmail-1.4.8-4.0.1.el4).  The following patch to functions/global.php appears to treat the symptom, but is not a complete fix:  --- /usr/share/squirrelmail/functions/global.php        2008-12-01 07:23:39.000000000 -0500 +++ global.php  2009-01-15 14:00:28.000000000 -0500 @@ -427,6 +427,10 @@      @session_start();      // could be: sq_call_function_suppress_errors('session_start');      $session_id = session_id(); +    if ($session_id == 'deleted') { +        session_regenerate_id(); +        $session_id = session_id(); +    }        // session_starts sets the sessionid cookie but without the httponly var      // setting the cookie again sets the httponly cookie attribute   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c1)  Dan Astoorian    2009-01-15 22:58:53 UTC  ``` Comparing functions/global.php in the Red Hat RPM to the main Squirrelmail distribution turns up a plausible cause for the problem: in sqsession_destroy(), Red Hat has:      if (isset($_COOKIE[session_name()])) sqsetcookie(session_name(), '', 0, $base_uri);     if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) sqsetcookie('username', '', 0, $base_uri);     if (isset($_COOKIE['key'])) sqsetcookie('key', '', 0, $base_uri);  whereas Squirrelmail 1.4.17 has:      if (isset($_COOKIE[session_name()])) sqsetcookie(session_name(), $_COOKIE[session_name()], 1, $base_uri);     if (isset($_COOKIE['key'])) sqsetcookie('key', 'SQMTRASH', 1, $base_uri);  Note that the third parameter to sqsetcookie() is set to 1 in SM1.4.17 and 0 in RH.  Inspection of the sqsetcookie() function shows that the expires header is set in the cookie only if empty($iExpire) is false.  Thus, an expiry parameter of 0 means that the cookie is not expired, compared with 1 meaning that the cookie is set to expire at 00:00:01 on January 1, 1970.  This could explain the observed symptom, although I have not tested the fix (replacing the 0s with 1s).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c2)  Michal Hlavinka    2009-01-16 11:38:18 UTC  ``` I'm able to reproduce this.  If you've tested replacing 0s with 1s, please let me know the result.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-16 15:24:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 329212](attachment.cgi?id=329212&action=diff "Possible fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=329212&action=edit "Possible fix") Possible fix  Only setting the expiration in sqsession_destroy() does not seem to be sufficient, as one of the SQMSESSID cookies remain set, so the 'deleted' will be session identifier for a user until the browser is restarted.  We should also uses non-empty second argument to sqsetcookie when unsetting session id cookie, as that's where 'deleted' gets introduced.  Patch also contains a change proposed in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c0), as that seems to be the only way to resolve the problem that got created without forcing all users which already have bad cookies to restart their browsers.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c5)  Dan Astoorian    2009-01-16 15:57:17 UTC  ``` Actually, 'deleted' comes from PHP, not from the default argument to sqsetcookie.  See the comments in <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1829098&group_id=311&atid=100311> for more information.  Try changing the formal argument in sqsetcookie from "deleted" to something else and reproduce the problem: you'll find that the contents of the cookie is still the word "deleted."  Changing 1s to 0s seems to fix the symptom for me.    However: if you log into Squirrelmail over https, then log out, and then follow the "Click here to sign back in" link, a cookie for a new session is sent without the "secure" attribute (i.e., Firefox reports "Send For: Any type of connection"), so the backport of the secure-cookie fix appears to be incomplete?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-16 16:30:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c5)) > Actually, 'deleted' comes from PHP, not from the default argument to > sqsetcookie.  Well, yes and no, as squirrelmail use both PHP's session handling (which seems to use setcookie internally) and own sqsetcookie, which does not use PHP's setcookie.  PHP's setcookie seems to set cookie value to 'deleted' when expiration time in the past is set.  > Try changing the formal argument in sqsetcookie from "deleted" to something > else and reproduce the problem: you'll find that the contents of the cookie > is still the word "deleted."  There are two 'deleted's in sqsetcookie.  sqsectookie called from sqsession_destroy() gets empty string as an argument, so the formal argument default value is not used, but deleted is set later:   if (!$sValue) $sValue = 'deleted';   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-16 16:42:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c5)) > However: if you log into Squirrelmail over https, then log out, and then follow > the "Click here to sign back in" link, a cookie for a new session is sent > without the "secure" attribute (i.e., Firefox reports "Send For: Any type of > connection"), so the backport of the secure-cookie fix appears to be > incomplete?  Possibly any other step is involved?  I don't seem to be able to reproduce...   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c8)  Dan Astoorian    2009-01-16 17:20:30 UTC  ``` I'm seeing the insecure cookie issue on our production server, but haven't succeeded in reproducing it from a fresh installation (will report back if I'm able to do so).  On a fresh installation, I'm seeing a different issue: I'm seeing SQMSESSID cookies with different paths for some reason (/webmail/ vs. /webmail/src/).  In [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c3) you say "*one of* the SQMSESSID cookies remain set": are you also seeing multiple SQMSESSID cookies, and if so, do they have different paths?  There should normally only ever be one SQMSESSID cookie in the browser for a particular squirrelmail installation at any given time (and sqm_baseuri() in strings.php appears to try to make it the one without the src/ suffix).  Re [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c6), I missed the second occurrence of "deleted" in sqsetcookie--you're right about the value being set to "deleted" there.  However, the value of a cookie with an expiration in the distant past should be irrelevant--the browser is just going to delete the cookie anyway.  Why is this bug's Priority: set to "low"?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c9)  Rob Henderson    2009-01-16 19:50:32 UTC  ``` We installed squirrelmail-1.4.8-5.el4_7.2 on our production server at 15:43 on 1/13.  I just got a report from a user that an email he sent 4 minutes later at 15:47 was sent with the From: address of some other user on our system.  YIKES!!!!  Interestingly, he said right after he hit 'Send' on that message he got an error about incorrect username or password and it kicked him to the login page.  I assume this is another manifestation of this session bug so this is obviously a critical issues for us (ie. not "low" priority :-)  I'm off to back out to squirrelmail-1.4.8-4.0.1.el4 unless anyone has a better recommendation for a quick workaround.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c10)  Dan Astoorian    2009-01-16 20:46:20 UTC  ``` Re: comments #6-#7: I found the reason for the discrepancy: our production server has the Squirrelmail compatibility plugin installed, with its patch to functions/strings.php applied to include plugins/compatibility/functions.php .  It appears that this has the effect that a consistent path is used for all cookies ("/webmail/"), but it also seems to result in the apparent insecure cookie being set (by PHP, not the squirrelmail code) when the proposed fix is applied.  This "insecure cookie" is visible in Firefox from Edit -> Preferences -> Privacy -> Show Cookies..., but it disappears from the list if the Cookies window is closed and re-opened, so this may just be a browser artifact.  If the fact that Red Hat's squirrelmail issues cookies with different paths set ("/webmail/" and "/webmail/src/") is not an operational problem (and it probably isn't), then Tomas's proposed fix looks like the right move.  The symptom described in [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c9) is indeed one of the manifestations of this bug, and the author may wish to consider applying Tomas's patch.  He may also wish to note that the other user's identity may have been written into his preferences under /var/lib/squirrelmail/prefs/ as a result of the session confusion, so even after applying the fix he may need to reestablish his identity in Squirrelmail under Options -> Personal Information, or alternatively by deleting the .pref file.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c11)  Rob Henderson    2009-01-16 21:16:16 UTC  ``` Thanks, Dan.  I did, in fact, find 3 user pref files that had been stepped on with contents from another user.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c12)  Jonathan Abbey    2009-01-16 21:21:49 UTC  ``` We were bitten by this one as well, complete with mail 'from' incorrect users, scrambled permanent prefs files, strange 'References:' headers, and more.  We had tracked it down to the 'deleted' session conflation before coming across this bug report.  We applied Tomas' patch and it seems to have ameliorated the situation for us.  I also definitely wouldn't consider this a 'low' priority bug.  One of our directors got involved with this. ;-/   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c13)  Peter C. Lai    2009-01-17 03:50:07 UTC  ``` I applied this patch; it seems to be holding up. The main effect that I saw is that in the php session-store, sess_deleted, if it shows up, will be zeroed out which I guess must be the proper behavior. (Whereas when the bug was live, sess_deleted actually contained live session information).  <soapbox>Clobbering sessions is certainly one giant security issue though, one way worse than the vulnerabilities that the update were supposed to patch... While we cannot be 100% sure, we really hope that nobody was able to actually read anybody else's mail during the time the bug had been reported to us (our users pretty much saw all 3 effects: incorrect preference application [can't verify clobbering], incorrect mailbox enumeration, wrong sender being used, and continuous prompting to re-login).</soapbox>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c14)  Dan Astoorian    2009-01-17 15:25:19 UTC  ``` Re: [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c13):  The patch (Tomas's attachment, not the workaround one I pasted into the original description) makes two adjustments.  One of them (described in comments #1 to #3) fixes the actual bug and should prevent sess_deleted from being created in the first place.  The second (described in the original description in this bug) makes Squirrelmail abandon sessions named "deleted" when a browser tries to establish or continue them, and has the effect of zeroing out the sess_deleted file: this mitigates the bug for anyone who's already logged in with a "deleted" session ID prior to the fix being applied.  Once all bad sessions have been blown away, the zero-size sess_deleted file should stop showing up.  My experience was that after applying the workaround fix I posted to the original comment, sess_deleted was zeroed out; after applying the rest of the fix, sess_deleted eventually stopped getting updated entirely and finally disappeared.  As far as I can tell, this bug should pose no risk of users gaining arbitrary access to each others' received mail in a typical configuration with login authentication to an IMAP server.  Squirrelmail, as far as I know, must send the user's password to the IMAP server for each transaction, and that information is not contained in the session: the password is split between the session and the browser, so you need both the "key" cookie stored in the browser at login time and the one-time pad stored in the session on the server in order to reconstruct the password and log into the IMAP server successfully.  (Failure to log into the IMAP server when the key and the pad are mismatched is almost certainly the cause of the symptom where Squirrelmail keeps prompting the user to re-login.)  What is at risk of disclosure between users or corruption is anything Squirrelmail itself stores for the session or the user, which may include user preferences (including identites), the folder list, address books, signatures, and perhaps uploaded attachments for outbound mail messages.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-17 19:05:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c8)) > I'm seeing the insecure cookie issue on our production server, but haven't > succeeded in reproducing it from a fresh installation (will report back if I'm > able to do so).

That's correct, but the $base_uri is not initialized for all pages, only seems to be set for the pages that are displayed in the top-most frames.  For others, cookie is set without path, resulting in browser using path of the script, i.e. with src/.  That problem is not specific to Red Hat backport, same problem exists in the latest upstream 1.4.17.  The extraneous src/ SQMSESSID cookie make this problem even bit worse.  > Re [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c6), I missed the second occurrence of "deleted" in > sqsetcookie--you're right about the value being set to "deleted" there.  > However, the value of a cookie with an expiration in the distant past should > be irrelevant--the browser is just going to delete the cookie anyway.  The code never tried to clean up /webmail/src/ cookie, only /webmail/ one.  > Why is this bug's Priority: set to "low"?  Bugzilla default value.   Even though the same SquirrelMail packages are shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5, RHEL5 does not seem to get into this bad state by user only logging out and re-logging in without closing web browser.  PHP4 and PHP5 versions seem to use different ways to deal with multiple values of the same  cookie specified in the requests (PHP4 uses last value, PHP5 first).  So on PHP5, it's more unlikely to get into this state, but bit more difficult to recover form it, due to an extraneous /src cookie (without restarting browser).  As the SQMSESSID is "session cookie", browser restart should be sufficient to get rid of "bad" cookie values (unless the browser is configured to use non-standard cookie handling).   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c16)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-17 19:10:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 329288](attachment.cgi?id=329288&action=diff "Updated patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=329288&action=edit "Updated patch") Updated patch  This change should prevent creation of /src/ cookie, as well as try to delete/expire existing one (if any exist on the user's side) during the session destroy.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=480224#c18)  Jon Jensen    2009-01-19 19:08:33 UTC  ``` I can confirm this bug in production on RHEL 3.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-17 17:38:25 UTC  ``` It was discovered that a backport of the patch for [CVE-2008-3663](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-3663) included in SquirrelMail packages as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5 contained a bug, that could result in different users being assigned insecure and identical session identifier.  Such session identifiers were assigned if user logged out of SquirrelMail and logged in again without closing web browser.  This could result in sessions of the multiple users to "merge".  Certain data from one user's session could have been displayed to other user (such as folder structure, address book and options, but not individual mails), or result in the overwrite of the preferences data with other user's settings.  Further details can be found in the [bug #480224](show_bug.cgi?id=480224 "CLOSED ERRATA - Squirrelmail session management broken by security backport").   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c3)  Josh Bressers    2009-01-19 20:57:01 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c4)  advax    2009-01-20 21:14:07 UTC  ``` We have seen the problems reported in #480224, and have rolled back from  to 1.4.8-4.0.1.el4 to 1.4.8-5.el4_7.2 on EL4.5 to resolve them. We have had user preferences become corrupted causing mail to be sent apparently from a different user, or duplicated "from" a second user.  When investigating I checked my cookies in Firefox which appeared to have "reasonable" values, deleted them, and logged in again to Squirrelmail. I noticed that I would be randomly logged out. Also on some occasions the list of subscribed folders in the left panel included folders belonging to another user, but if I clicked on them I got a "no such folder" error as they do not exist in my account.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-21 07:36:30 UTC  ``` Version 1.4.8-5.el4_7.2 is known to be affected by issues mentioned in the [bug #480224](show_bug.cgi?id=480224 "CLOSED ERRATA - Squirrelmail session management broken by security backport").  The update has been released to address them.  If you are still seeing some issue with latest packages, please file a bug against squirrelmail component, with detailed steps to reproduce.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c6)  Scott Dowdle    2009-01-27 16:11:46 UTC  ``` I'm running squirrelmail-1.4.8-5.el4_7.3 and I still have the issue.  I have had two users report that email they are sending is using the account information from another user.  I have logged in as them and verified that indeed all of the account settings information displayed is that of another user.  I'm wondering if this is a result of corruption or data alteration created by the previous version... affecting the current version.  In any event I have the latest version and a few users seem to have the problem.  I don't know how wide spread the issue is (it hasn't affected my account) but I have had two users report it... and as I said, I verified it.  Not sure where to do from here?  Should I wait for an update (is there going to be one)?  Should I rollback two versions (where there is a security issue)?  In the meantime, I'm just disabling the webmail system.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-01-27 17:42:24 UTC  ``` As noted in [bug #480224](show_bug.cgi?id=480224 "CLOSED ERRATA - Squirrelmail session management broken by security backport"), corruption of the user preferences files was one of the most severe symptoms of this flaw, causing one user's preferences to be written to preferences files of other user (you should be able to manually verify by inspecting individual files in /var/lib/squirrelmail/prefs/).  As was noted in the errata text, all users that have used affected version of squirrelmail (1.4.8-5.el4_7.2 on RHEL4) should review (and correct if needed) their preferences.  Alternatively, restore from backup can be used to revert all users preferences to known good state.  Updated packages make sure to immediately discard all bogus session identifier to avoid further corruptions, but can not undo changes that happened while broken packages were used.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c8)  Scott Dowdle    2009-01-27 17:58:32 UTC  ``` Tomas,  Thanks for responding to my recent addition to this bug report and bringing to my attention details I did not notice that were there.  I will follow those instructions and report any additional problems if I encounter them although I don't anticipate having them.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=480488#c9)  Red Hat Product Security    2009-02-26 09:17:49 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0057.html>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Important: squirrelmail security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0057)

## Topic

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes a security issue is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SquirrelMail is an easy-to-configure, standards-based, webmail package
written in PHP. It includes built-in PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP
protocols, and pure HTML 4.0 page-rendering (with no JavaScript required)
for maximum browser-compatibility, strong MIME support, address books, and
folder manipulation.

The Red Hat SquirrelMail packages provided by the RHSA-2009:0010 advisory
introduced a session handling flaw. Users who logged back into SquirrelMail
without restarting their web browsers were assigned fixed session
identifiers. A remote attacker could make use of that flaw to hijack user
sessions. (CVE-2009-0030)

SquirrelMail users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains a
patch to correct this issue. As well, all users who used affected versions
of SquirrelMail should review their preferences.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>
