{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A flawed backport of a security patch for CVE-2008-3663 in SquirrelMail caused session identifiers to be insecurely and identically assigned to different users under specific conditions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect session management",
      "Static session identifiers",
      "Failure to properly expire session cookies",
      "Incomplete backport of security fix"
     ],
    "impact": "Multiple users could have their sessions merged, leading to:\n  - Exposure of folder structure, address book, and user options to other users.\n  - Overwriting of user preference data with other users' settings.\n  - Email being sent with the 'from' address of a different user\n  - Users being logged out randomly",
    "attack_vectors": "A user logging out of SquirrelMail and then logging back in without closing the web browser. No remote attacker interaction required, a regular user action is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "No special capabilities are needed, any user with a valid SquirrelMail account could trigger the vulnerability."
