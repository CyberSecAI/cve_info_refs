Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the `FLOWS_030000.WWV_FLOW_USERS` table in Oracle APEX. This allows unprivileged database users to directly query the table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Password Hash Exposure:**  The `WWV_FLOW_USERS` table contains password hashes in columns such as `WEB_PASSWORD2` which are directly accessible to unprivileged users.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Lack of proper restrictions on database object access exposes sensitive data to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain password hashes for APEX users. This can lead to unauthorized access to APEX applications if the hashes are cracked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local SQL Access:** The attacker must have local access to the Oracle database via SQL*Plus or similar tools.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to have a database user account with the `CONNECT` role.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker needs to have a database user account that is able to connect to the Oracle database.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable table is `FLOWS_030000.WWV_FLOW_USERS`.
*   Password hashes are stored in the `WEB_PASSWORD2` column.
*   A sample SQL query to extract password hashes is provided: `select user_name,web_password2 from FLOWS_030000.WWV_FLOW_USERS`

**Affected Systems:**
* Oracle APEX 3.0 (potentially as part of an Oracle 11.1.0.7 installation)

**Mitigation:**
*   Apply the patches provided in the Oracle CPU (Critical Patch Update) for April 2009.

The information provided is more detailed than the typical CVE description, as it includes:

*   Specific vulnerable table and column names.
*   Example SQL queries for exploitation.
*   Specific versions of Oracle products affected.
*   Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
