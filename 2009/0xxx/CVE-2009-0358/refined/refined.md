  "CVE-2009-0358": {
    "description": "Paul Nel reported that certain HTTP directives to not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and Cache-Control: no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by Firefox 3. On a shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP directives could potentially expose private data. Another user on the system could use this vulnerability to view improperly cached pages containing private data by navigating the browser back.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Firefox 3 was ignoring certain HTTP directives (Cache-Control: no-store and Cache-Control: no-cache) for HTTPS pages when navigating back in browser history.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper caching of sensitive information despite directives to avoid it."
      ],
      "impact": "On a shared system, private data could be exposed to another user. Sensitive information from web pages intended not to be cached could be viewed by navigating the browser back. This could lead to information disclosure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local attacker using the back button in a browser after another user visited a page with sensitive information. This attack requires the same system and a shared browser user account."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to a system where another user has viewed sensitive information in Firefox 3. The attacker does not need any special privileges.",
       "affected_products": [
          "Firefox 3.0"
        ]
